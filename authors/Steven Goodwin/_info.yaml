bio: "When builders go down to the pub they talk about football. Presumably therefore, when footballers go down to the pub they talk about builders!

Constantly...\r\n\r\nHe is also known as the angry man of open source.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.bluedust.dontexist.com\">Steven Goodwin</a> a blog that no one reads that, and a <a href=\"http://www.thebeercrate.com\">beer podcast</a> that no one listens to :)"
