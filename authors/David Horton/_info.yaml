bio: 'David Horton got started with GNU/Linux in 1996 when he needed a way to share a single dial-up internet connection with his college room-mates. He found the solution he needed with an early version of Slackware and a copy of the PPP-HOWTO from The Linux Documentation Project. More than ten years later he is older and wiser and still hooked on GNU/Linux. Many of Dave''s interests and hobbies can be explored on his <a href="http://www.happy-monkey.net">website</a>.'
