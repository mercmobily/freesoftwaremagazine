bio: 'Marcus McCallion is the art director and designer for the independent electronica label LOCA Records. Formed in 1999, this copyleft label has consistently explored, questioned and challenged the purpose of music and art. The innovative and radical design for Wards the single “Armonica or Something”, saw the collaborative production of 100 different cover designs. More recently, Marcus has used his knowledge and passion for typography to collaborate with protagonists of free culture - the Libre Society. The result was the production of the first ever copyleft typefaces, called "Posse" and "Profiteer". Acting as differing voices, they were used throughout his “open” design of the Libre Manifesto. Both of these type designs are freely available for download through Marcus''s own type foundry ÜNDT.'
