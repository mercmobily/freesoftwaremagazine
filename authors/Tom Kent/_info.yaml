bio: "I was a Software Engineer (that did some programming in C++/Python/(FORTRAN, god help us)) until Sept. 2010, when my wife and I moved to Montero, Bolivia to volunteer. Now I am teaching a class on Introduction to Multimedia (http://teeks99.com/multimedia-intro/MultimediaClass.html or https://github.com/teeks99/multimedia-intro CC-BY-SA) at the Instituto San Sebastian Pelczar.  This class uses primarily free software for Photo, Graphics, Audio, Video, and Web Page creation/editing. \r\nI have been running Linux since about 2002, and on my primary systems since about 2005.  In general, I try to use free software, open formats, and creative commons media wherever possible."
