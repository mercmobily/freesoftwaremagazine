bio: "In a time long, long, long ago, when Mainframes roamed the land, a new life form appeared.  Personal Computers.  In a successful hunt (requiring much begging, crying, and whining to my parents) I captured one.  Life->Domain->Kingdom->Phylum->Class->Order->Family->Genus: Apple IIE.  Ever since opening my Apple IIE box and booting it up, I’ve been hooked!  From writing little game programs, or school papers, I loved that thing.  Now, many years later, I still dabble in the binary world by writing articles, contributing to open source projects, and if I’m lucky even making some money.  But I digress; here is my Bio.<br><br>\r\n\r\nFounder and President of NemaCo Inc, company specializing in government purchasing/acquisition support.  In my spare time, contributor to Falcon (www.falconpl.org) and a few other open source projects.  Been known to code, project management, test, complain, drink and create havoc.   Not necessarily in that order."
