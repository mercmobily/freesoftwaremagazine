bio: 'Robert Pogson has worked with computers since 1968 as a student, accelerator technician, inventor, and teacher. The revelation in 1999 that PCs rarely crashed without some help from software lead to his adoption of free software on GNU/Linux. Since 2003 he has been using a Linux Terminal Server in remote northern Canadian schools using available PCs in labs and classrooms.'
