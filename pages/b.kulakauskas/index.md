<p>Bridget Kulakauskas deals with accounts and administration at Free Software Magazine.</p>

<p>Bridget met <a href="/contacts/t.mobily/">Tony Mobily</a> through <a href="/contacts/d.guard/">Dave Guard</a> in 2002. Fremantle is such a small town it was unavoidable really.</p>

<p>She spent several years in banking and finance and knows what you are supposed to do with money. She also knows how to make paper and files organise themselves, find things that are lost, and all the other banal but necessary things that administration and accounting entails. She would like to stress that she is not an accountant. That would be boring.</p>

<p>Bridget has a passionate interest in free software because of the wide reaching social implications of technology on a global scale. So she likes to blog about it in her free time.</p>
