# Are you having trouble downloading an issue?

A few people each month have problems downloading Free Software Magazine. The magazine's PDF file is hosted on a very fast download server; however, when 20000+ people are trying to get the same large file, even the most powerful server has hiccups.Please read these instructions if you have problems downloading:

1) **Problem: download managers and proxy servers?** These are the most likely causes of download difficulties. Often, buggy download managers (that is, most of them) only download a portion of the file; subsequent attempts will only download _that_ portion, until the download manager or the proxy server decides to "forget" about that file. **Solution: disable the download manager or the proxy server, and try again.**

2) **Problem: the download is too slow, and stalls.** This is often the case when the server is under a high load. **Solution: retry again after 8 or 12 hours.**

If the problems persist, please send an email to "helpdesk" *at* "freesoftwaremagazine" *dot* "com" explaining what happened precisely when you tried to solve the problem by following the instructions above. We will do our best to help you!
