Help us promote Free Software Magazine!

We've had quite a few requests from readers asking for us to provide banners for them to put on their own sites to help support us. At their suggestion, we have created a few sticker-like banners for you to put up on your site if you would like to help out too. So, please, add them to your web site or your blog and help us spread the word about our magazine! 

Please link the banners to the following URL:

http://www.freesoftwaremagazine.com/

If you prefer standard banners :

<img src="/files/nodes/1760/fsm_banner-120x40.gif" align="center" alt="FSM banner image"/>
<br />
<img src="/files/nodes/1760/fsm_banner-125x125.gif" align="center" alt="FSM banner image"/>
<br />
<img src="/files/nodes/1760/fsm_banner_468x60.gif" align="center" alt="FSM banner image"/>
<br />

Or, if you want to show you care:

<img src="/files/nodes/1760/iproudlysupport_120x40.gif" align="center" alt="I support FSM image"/>     
<br />
<img src="/files/nodes/1760/iproudlysupport_125x125.gif" align="center" alt="I support FSM image"/>
<br />
<img src="/files/nodes/1760/iproudlysupport_468x60.gif" align="center" alt="I support FSM image"/>
<br />

For the die-hards:

<img src="/files/nodes/1760/ilovefsm_120x40_anim.gif" align="center" alt="I love FSM image"/>
<br />
<img src="/files/nodes/1760/ilovefsm_125x125_anim.gif" align="center" alt="I love FSM image"/>
<br />
