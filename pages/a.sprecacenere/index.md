<p>Alan Sprecacenere is the graphic designer for Free Software Magazine.</p>
<p>Initially he was only supposed to create something to put on the cover of the first issue of the magazine. Then, half driven by his passion for graphic design and half because of Tony Mobily's debatable taste, he became the official designer for the project.</p>
<br><p>In his early twenties, he has been a computer geek for as long as he can remember: like many others, he began by playing (literally, as he never enjoyed programming!) with his Commodore 64.</p>
<p>He likes any kind of graphics, web (he takes care of <a href="http://www.qreate.net">Qreate</a>'s web section), video and general multimedia. He loves technological gadgets (especially the useless ones), PDAs and "made in Japan" widgets. </p>
<p>He never knows how to cut his hair! (but you had already guessed that...)</p>
