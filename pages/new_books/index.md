Okay, here is a list of books to choose from. Following that, there's a list places for you to choose books from if you can't find anything in the first list.

Please keep in mind the following:


* If possible, please pick a book from this list, rather than a publisher's catalog.
* It's best to pick two books from a single publisher if possible. It cuts down on their costs in terms of postage.
* When choosing from the catalogs of publishers please keep in mind that we are only interested in reviewing books that are relevant to free/open source software. The book should score 6/10 or more for free software relevance. (A book on Linux would get 10/10, for example. A book on Firefox could talk purely about its use on Linux (10/10), or it could cover use on Windows, Mac and Linux; this would reduce the relevance slightly to perhaps 7-9/10 depending on how much focus there is on using it on non-free OSes.)
* When making a request please send an email to t.mobily [AT] freesoftwaremagazine.com with the subject "FSM Book review request".
* Please include your full mailing address and phone number in the format:
