<h1>Free Software Magazine’s style guide</h1>

<h2>A quick list of rules to follow while writing articles for Free Software Magazine</h2>

<br>
<br>

<p>Here is a list of points which must be followed while writing for Free Software Magazine:</p>

<h3>The technical side</h3>

<ul type="disc">
        <li>Hand in your article using the online interface. Don't send your article as an attachment.</li>

        <li>The figures <strong>must</strong> be 9.1cm wide, and between 5cm and 10 cm high and <strong>in JPEG format</strong>. All images must be at 300 DPI. In pixels, that is 1075 x (591 - 1181).</li>

        <li>Download a new, up to date article template file (XML) from the <a href="/write_for_us">Write for us</a> page) before writing your article.</li>

        <li>Do <strong>not</strong> abuse the bold (like I just did with the <i>not</i>).</li>

</ul>

<h3>Words, words, words</h3>

<ul type="disc">
        <li>Refer to the Linux kernel as <i>Linux</i>. Refer to GNU/Linux (as in the kernel + all the support programs and libraries) as GNU/Linux.</li>

        <li>Use <i>free software</i> (NOT <em>freeware</em>) for free or open source software, <i>shareware</i> for shareware software, and <i>proprietary software</i> (NOT <em>commercial software</em>) for software that is not free.</li>

        <li>Do not use Capital Letters at the beginning of Words unless you are typing a Proper Noun (like Linus Torvalds, Microsoft, etc.). Improper capitalisation is a real pain for editors.</li>

        <li>Do capitalise acronyms (like <em>IBM</em> which means International business Machines, TCP which means Transport Control Protocol, and so on).</li>

        <li>Spell check your article before sending it. If you are writing them 5 minutes before the deadline, jump on a time machine and re-read them 48 hours after finishing them.</li>

        <li>Write the word <i>internet</i> with a <em>small</em> <i>i</i>. We are trying to create a new trend.</li>

        <li>Do not capitalise headings (in this section I wrote <i>Words, words, words</i> rather than <i>Words, Words, Words</i>).</li>

</ul>

<h3>Style issues</h3>

<ul type="disc">
        <li>If you are the sole author of the article, refer to yourself as <i>I</i> (rather than <i>we</i>). For example: <i>In this article I will show how to ...</i>. If you are writing (and signing) the article with somebody else, refer to yourselves as <i>we</i>.</li>

        <li>When addressing the readers, use <i>you</i>. Avoid Prince Charles’ <i>one</i> (<i>one should be careful [...]</i>).</li>

        <li>Use either English spellings or American spellings, but <em>be consistent</em> throughout the article.</li>

        <li>Separate each section of the article with a heading (like <i>Style issues</i> here). If you can’t, the article probably has a structural problem.</li>

        <li>Write in a semi-informal way.</li>
</ul>
