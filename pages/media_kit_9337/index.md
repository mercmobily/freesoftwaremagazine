<h2>The Story</h2>

<p>Free Software Magazine was created in 2004. It focuses on free and open source software, a market that has been booming over the last few years&#x2014;and which is only going to get bigger.<p>

<p>FSM is not yet another Linux magazine. It covers free and open source software as a whole. Our audience is split amongst normal users (those people who use Linux or BSD as a desktop computer) and more advanced users who use free and open source software mainly on server systems (system administrators, web programmers, and so on).</p>

<p>Our readers are educated, love the IT world and are committed to it.</p>

<h2>The Target</h2>

<p>IT professionals, managers, programmers, everyday desktop users, free software enthusiasts, and anybody who owns a computer and is interested in free and open source software. See our <a href="#charts">demographic information charts</a> at the bottom of this page for more information about your potential customers!</p>

<h2>The advertising possibilities</h2>

<p>Here are the advertising possibilities in Free Software Magazine:</p>
