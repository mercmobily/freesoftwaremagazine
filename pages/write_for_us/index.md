## Proposals

Please send your editorial proposals to:

=IMAGE_PRIVATE=/images/email_proposals.gif=====

Make sure that the subject of your email is `PROPOSAL: article on [...]` and the body of your email has the following structure:

**Target:**

Write your article’s target here. Think about the person who is reading it: what do they know? How well do they know it? What are they curious about?

**Aim:**

Write your article’s aim here. What is it going to tell the reader? How? Why will the reader know more about the subject after reading this article?

**Abstract**

Write your article’s abstract here. It should be a summary of the whole article, in just 10-15 lines.

**Outline:**

-First heading

-Second heading

-Third heading

-Fourth heading

For each heading, please provide 3 to 6 lines that explain what that section of the article will contain.

If the proposal is accepted, you will be given a deadline for handing in the complete article.

Please keep in mind that you won’t be able to hand in your article if it’s not valid _and_ well formatted. Please check that your article follows the template.

You _must_ use a spell checker to check typos and errors in your article before handing it in. We advise authors to use OpenOffice or ispell.

You _must_ read the [author’s style guide](/write_for_us/style_guide) while writing the article.

Finally, you should read [Writing articles for Free Software Magazine](/articles/writing_articles/) written by Clare James and Tony Mobily before submitting your outline--especially if you haven’t written before.

While writing the article, you should stick with the outline you agreed to with the technical editor. However, you can make changes if you think they’re appropriate.
