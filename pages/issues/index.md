# Paper magazines no more!

Free Software Magazine used to be a paper magazine: readers could subscribe to it, and receive a dead-tree copy of it.
Luckily, a few years back we went 100% online -- and never looked back!
Here is a link to the contents that was published in each issue:

* [Issue 0](/issues/issue_000)
* [Issue 1](/issues/issue_001)
* [Issue 2](/issues/issue_002)
* [Issue 3](/issues/issue_003)
* [Issue 4](/issues/issue_004)
* [Issue 5](/issues/issue_005)
* [Issue 6](/issues/issue_006)
* [Issue 7](/issues/issue_007)
* [Issue 8](/issues/issue_008)
