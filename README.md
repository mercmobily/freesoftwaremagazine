# Free Software Magazine

This repository is the full Free Software Magazine website source, built as a large Jekyll static site.

- Articles live in `articles/<slug>/index.md`
- Author and taxonomy pages are generated by Jekyll plugins
- The built site output is written to `_site/`

## Local Setup

Prerequisites:

- Ruby 3.2+
- Bundler
- Node.js + npm

Install dependencies:

```bash
bundle install
```

## Author Workflow

```bash
# Fast validation for one article
npm run check:article -- my_new_article_slug

# Full-site preview
npm run preview

# Article-only fast preview
npm run preview -- my_new_article_slug

# Full-site preview without LiveReload
npm run preview:no-live

# Article-only fast preview without LiveReload
npm run preview:no-live -- my_new_article_slug
