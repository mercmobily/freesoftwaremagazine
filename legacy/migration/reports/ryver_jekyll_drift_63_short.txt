  OLD: Copyright is, in the American tradition, offered to copyright holders to encourage publication, particularly of new ideas, by providing a temporary restriction on the public's rights, often as a means to enable monetary gain.  This temporary restriction is not unlimited either in duration or scope, as it cannot strip users of other natural rights, and so is further balanced by the idea of fair use  2 .  Some nations, in fact, even go further by including not only copyright, but also fair use, as part of their national constitutions.  Hence, like in a contract, we have a bargain that has been negotiated, between copyright holders and users, with both parties having specific obligations to each other.  Copyright is not meant to maximize copyright holder's profits, but rather to provide sufficient incentive to promote publication.

  OLD: When my DVD player stopped working, I definitively proved to myself (and to people I know) that if there is a simple and effective solution to a problem and a complex one which promises unpredictable results, I always choose the second option. Instead of buying a new DVD/DivX/MP3 player for the modest price of $40-50, I decided to build a home-made device that would allow me to record the TV, receive podcasts, watch my favorite movies, view webtv, play games, and a lot of other things that I considered cool.

  OLD: Can artists actually make money on a free software driven free culture project? Having established the motivations and the basic principles in the first two parts, I'm going to look at the big picture here: how money would be distributed among major parts of the project (drawing partly on knowledge accumulated from the proprietary film and television industry -- taking into account the differences), where the money would come from, and what sort of income might be realistic based on the few projects that have gone before us.

articles/creating_fsm_latex/index.md
  OLD: When I received the first email from Tony asking me to set up the typesetting subsystem for Free Software Magazine (FSM), I was proud... and terrified. I have spent the last six years of my life using LaTeX and, ultimately, TeX, to typeset single articles, songbooks, my thesis, CV’s, flyers, and letters. Even though my knowledge of the companion packages and classes was pretty good, the first thing I thought was: “How is it possible to compose a whole magazine, article by article, and at the same time build the table of contents (ToC) in the same way as the composition of books?” The problem is that every article has a title, a subtitle and one or more authors: all of this information has to be placed  neatly  in the ToC. Even after a bit of research, I was still wondering: “Will I be able to do a proper job?”

  OLD: Since we couldn’t find a single decent semi-visual XML editor, we asked our authors to hand in XML directly. Of course, people became very creative when they created an article file: we had to write a script that deleted white spaces around tags, and generally "cleaned up" the XML files we received. We also had to check manually that the files had the right em dashes, the right opening and closing speech marks, the right apostrophes, and so on. I won't even get started on the problems some authors had with getting the XML right:   tags left unclosed,   items without   first, and so on. It doesn't sound complicated, but when you have a 2500 word article full of listings, text boxes, figures and so on, and (even worse) when the XML error you get from the parser is as unhelpful as it could be, things got tricky. It was a small nightmare, which repeated with every issue of the magazine, and nearly every article. Two prospective (and influential) bloggers refused accounts with Free Software Magazine when they realised they would have to spend time tagging up XML files. Laziness? Maybe. But, as we say around here, "fair enough".

  OLD: “[Astronaut] Anna Fisher got the job of helping design a [space]suit for women. This had nothing to do with fashion and everything to do with safety. A poor fit is unacceptable, because it would make it impossible to move. As a small person, Fisher found the unisex stock sizes simply unworkable. ‘Women are not smaller men’, she reminded the astronaut office, which apparently had to be reminded, ‘Women are built differently’. For a while NASA thought it would be more economical to select a large candidate who would fit the suit, rather than adjust the suit to fit a smaller woman, but tall women are also built differently, another lesson NASA had to learn.”—Bettyann Holtzmann Kevles,  Almost Heaven: The Story of Women in Space  [1]

articles/from_java_to_mozilla/index.md
  OLD: Java is a multi-platform object-oriented language. In other words, you can use constructs and patterns of object-oriented world to write programs deployable in different operating systems without changing a line of code and without “recompiling”. Although this is quite common for interpreted languages, the Java code is not interpreted. Java compilers build binary code called bytecode, which is loaded and executed by a virtual machine, independently upon which the operating system is running in the “real” machine. Thus, a bytecode compiled under Windows can be loaded and executed by a virtual machine running on Unix. The Java virtual machine hides underlying system-related details and it is provided with a unified API, common to all platforms. This implies that only the functionalities that are common to all platforms can be exploited by Java programs. The idea of “virtual machines” is not a new one; older languages such as Smalltalk introduced this solution years before Java, but as often occurs, the best and the first are not automatically the most successful.

articles/lasting_digital_archives_millenniatas_new_archival_dvd_technology/index.md
  OLD: A new optical disk technology offers a fundamental new capability -- which is storing offline archives in a format with a shelf life of many decades (or even centuries). The key is in the pits: unlike commonly available dye-based CD-R and DVD-R media, the Millenniata writer actually laser etches  physical pits  into the writable layer of its "M-Disc" DVD-ROMs. Because the pits are physical structures, like the pits on pressed media, they have the same kind of shelf-life -- but in a way that is economical for low-copy archives. The niche here is for digital archives of "time capsule" data: family photographs, historical records, original manuscripts, video footage and masters, and so on. Perhaps more remarkably, the drives and disks, are affordable enough for the target applications and available commercially right now.

Peer productions don’t draw labour away from the market; instead, they use resources unused by the market and thus form a competition to market production in some domains. Firms can also profit from these mechanisms when working together with non-market forces. The boundary between producers on one side, and consumers and users on the other side, blurs. Increasingly, consumers come to produce what they want themselves, collaborating with like-minded people or companies. New business models and more  interactive products  are needed in this networked information economy.
  NEW: Commons-based peer productions are here to stay. Humans have always shared and collaborated with one another. Of course, not everything is always shared.

articles/refactoring_multimedia_project_inkscape_blender_and_audacity/index.md
  OLD: One of the special problems with managing a multimedia project (versus a text-based software project), is that there are often links to external data files which can get broken when you try to move the files around -- such as you might do when re-factoring the source code to make it more navigable. Three programs that we use extensively in the  Lunatics  project present this problem, and each requires slightly different handling. These are Inkscape, Blender, and Audacity. I have never found a compact guide to keeping the links straight in these programs, so I'm going to write one here.

  OLD: Unfortunately, the XML recipe displayed in the browser looks just as unattractive as it does in the text editor. Can you imagine trying to share this kind of recipe with family and friends? I can hear the conversation now, “Yeah, Mom, just ignore the stuff between the angle brackets... Right, the ones that look like greater-than and less-than... Because it’s XML and it’s cool, that’s why...”

  OLD: A real HTML document should have tags and currently  output.html  has none. To make a valid HTML file I’ll need to fix up the XSL style sheet to at least produce  ,   and   tags in the appropriate places. This can be done by adding a single XSLT processing rule called a template. You can think of an XSLT template as being like a word processor’s find-and-replace feature. You use the “match” attribute to tell the template what XML element it should find. Everything between the template’s starting and ending tags is the replacement text. To convert my margarita recipe to HTML I need my style sheet to match the recipe element in the XML source file and replace it with appropriate HTML elements in the output document.
