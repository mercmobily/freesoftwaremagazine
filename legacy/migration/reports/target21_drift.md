  Robin Miller recently published a story on Newsforge about "Stan"[1], as an example of a situation that demonstrates proprietary software is a danger to business continuity.  I found this story interesting since I think Mr. Miller came close to correctly identifying a core issue, which is that the proprietary software business model as it exists today both facilitates and encourages vendors to act in bad faith.  However, it did not need to have been this way, and really comes down to misuse of licensing along with some deliberate abuse and exploitation of existing commercial law. 
+
  Software definitions 
+
  In theory, there should exist two kinds of software; "contract" software, which is contracted for private use, and "copyrighted" software, which is sold between unrelated parties.  What we call free software is actually a special case of the latter. 
+
  "Contract" software, is software produced under a contract presumably negotiated in good faith under conditions of equal bargaining by two or more parties, or even that may be produced by individuals as employees for private use by a company under what is in effect an "employment contract".  In fact, most software written today is neither what I generally refer to as "proprietary software", which is something separate, nor software distributed as "free software", but rather contract software, and I find no ethical issue of direct concern in the practice of such software contracting in itself. 
+
  Software, as a fixed expression of ideas, is also assumed to be subject to copyright. Copyright can be thought of, especially in the American tradition, as if it is a special kind of contract.  It is not one negotiated directly by the individuals parties involved in the transaction themselves, but rather is a little like a contract that had already been pre-negotiated under terms pre-established by the national government between copyright holders and society as a whole. 
+
  The American concept of copyright 
- Copyright is, in the American tradition, offered to copyright holders to encourage publication, particularly of new ideas, by providing a temporary restriction on the public's rights, often as a means to enable monetary gain.  This temporary restriction is not unlimited either in duration or scope, as it cannot strip users of other natural rights, and so is further balanced by the idea of fair use  2 .  Some nations, in fact, even go further by including not only copyright, but also fair use, as part of their national constitutions.  Hence, like in a contract, we have a bargain that has been negotiated, between copyright holders and users, with both parties having specific obligations to each other.  Copyright is not meant to maximize copyright holder's profits, but rather to provide sufficient incentive to promote publication.

This temporary restriction is not unlimited either in duration or scope, as it cannot strip users of other natural rights, and so is further balanced by the idea of fair use [2], also known as fair dealing.

Hence, like in a contract, we have a bargain that has been negotiated, between copyright holders and users, with both parties having specific obligations to each other.  Copyright is not meant to maximize copyright holder's profits, but rather to provide sufficient incentive to promote publication. 
+
  While the public's right to distribute (publicly copy) or sublicense is embargoed temporarily during copyright, part of the copyright holder's obligations to the public includes the ability of the public to reclaim a work when copyright has expired.  Private copying, such as in one's own home for personal use, is often a more contentious issue, particularly in regard to the 4th Amendment, and fair use tries to address this issue as well.  In fact, existing copyright law does not trump human rights, and hence fair use provisions do explicitly allow both for some form of at least limited private copying. 
+
  Similarly, copyright law cannot actually exceed first amendment free speech protections, and hence, in American law, there are provisions made in fair use that are consistent with the idea that a copyrighted work can be parodied, the work can be "discussed", explicit portions (excerpts) used for educational purposes, etc. 
+
  Copyright and software 
+
  Of course, the concept of copyright was originally developed around a 17th century book publishing model, where a few explicit authors would undertake writing of a "work".  This model breaks down when we consider that software can be written in very small assemblies that can be collected together from thousands of individuals, organized, and presented as a new "work".  Furthermore, there are all forms of transitory "copying" that may occur in software, and our internet connected work, including caching, loading of programs and media into volatile memory, etc., which were not originally foreseen.  Each of these have meant changes made in the evolution of copyright law over time; some often very poorly done in a one sided manner, clearly at the public expense.  However, the principal of copyright remains that of a trade-off of privileges and obligations, even if often today an unbalanced one. [3] 
+
  While the book publishing model is not quite correct for software, it is possible to use traditional understanding of the ethical application of copyright in books as a starting point to understand how copyright can be ethically applied to special cases such as software.  However, it is first necessary to consider what software is, and how it differs. 
+
  First and foremost when we talk about software, we have the question of source code.  If the purpose of encouraging publication through the limited privilege of copyright is to "promote the progress of science and useful arts", as stated in the U.S. constitution, this is only possible with software by including publication of the source.

  For the seventh time now, the Université Libre de Bruxelles [1] in Brussels, Belgium, is hosting FOSDEM [2].

  The impact of meetings like these on the free software community as awhole is huge. Apart from the obvious attractions of the meeting, such asthe ability to go to different talks and learn about exciting newthings related tofree software or to see demos at different stands, FOSDEM also allowsyou to meet people from all kinds of different backgrounds. 
+
  
+
  And rather than just being limited to ASCII conversations,which iswhat most free software projects limit themselves to bynecessity, a real-life meeting allows you to not only put names tofaces but also to do those things which people usually think of asenjoyable: go to a bar and discuss your views on a particular problemfrom a project you're working on, on the project as a whole, on freesoftware as a whole, or heck, on the world as a whole. 
+
  I think it's hard to overestimate the effect that conferences such asthis one have on people. Since FOSDEM is in Belgium I've never missedit once; every time the boost in morale and in motivation which ithas given me has helped keep me going for another year. The effects onsocial networking, and the discussion culture within a project, that an eventlike this has is therefore immensely important. 
+
  Lots of things have happened in these last seven years and FOSDEM 2007 isalmost nothing like that first edition back in 2001, then still calledOSDEM. Obviously the event has grown: it's gone from hosting a fewhundred to a few thousand people; it has grown from holding threeconcurrent talks at any time in three different aulas to holding twoconcurrent talks in the primary rooms - and a zillion more in the 10or so developer's rooms being managed by various projects. On a muchmore personal level, I have been appointed as the "volunteer" toorganize the GPG key signing party; and for Debian, I am organisingtheir presence for the fourth time (both a booth and a developer'sroom). 
+
  Volunteer or not, I do love preparing things like this. If you wereto ask me why, I don't think I could tell you: perhaps it is related tothe fact that it reminds me in late September and early October thatFOSDEM still exists; perhaps, though I'd hate for this to be true, it'sbecause it makes me feel more important than I really am; perhaps it'sbecause it helps me warm up slowly for the real thing, so ithelps me enjoy the event so much more. Whatever the reason, I wouldn'twant my half year without it. 
+
  And now it's that time of year again. At the time of writing, it'ssaturday evening, 1AM, and I'm about to find my bed; but witheverything still fresh in my head, I felt I had to write it downnow. 
+
  For the first time, since what seems like forever, the FOSDEMorganizers managedto actually have an  almost  working network at 9AM in the morning,with everything fully set up at 10. The main difference with previousyears was that this time around, rather than setting up the equipmentwhen everyone else is allowed in, they arrived at the insane hour of 5AMto start laying cables, installing AP devices, and doing more of thisgeneral grunt work; by the time people started arriving, the networkwas almost fully operational, prompting me to take a picture of mylaptop with an  ssh -v  session running. A working network could besaid to be taking away part of the charm that defines FOSDEM though.Heh.

  Introduction 
+
  A media center is a special type of computer conceived for your living room rather than for your office. There are several models of media center available on the market and most of them are based on the Microsoft Windows Media Center Edition. Differently from a traditional personal computer, the interaction with a media center mainly flows through the remote control and the television screen. It is of course possible to add a wireless keyboard for writing text but most of the time a media center is used by one or more users enjoying content from separate sources such as DVD, Video CD, digital video cameras, FM radio, analog/digital terrestrial TV or satellite TV, network streaming and, of course, the local hard disk.

  Differently from a traditional personal computer, the interaction with a media center mainly flows through the remote control and the television screen 
  
+
  What hardware you need 
+
  Assuming you want to build your own media center, the ingredients you need are of three types: hardware, software and connectivity. Your media center will gain a lot from a LAN connection which is useful for management tasks and for receiving media streams from the internet. Regarding the hardware the essential components are: motherboard, CPU, RAM, disk, video card with TV/OUT, audio card, TV/FM card, network card, CD/DVD player and a remote control with IR receiver. Of course you can add a lot of optional components like a DVD writer and USB memory readers. 
+
  To build an effective system you need a minimum CPU power for video encoding/decoding. Buying an Intel Core Duo with 2GB of RAM is a viable choice, but in my experience you can save a lot of money reusing some old hardware. I’ve assembled a system with Pentium III processor with 320MB of RAM and I found that for video encoding/decoding this configuration is powerful enough. If you don’t have any old PC to cannibalize, you can buy a mobo/CPU/RAM for less than 100$ on eBay and get your system done.

+
  GNU/Linux helps to make your old hardware run again. It’s always possible to optimize GNU/Linux, while Windows XP is too resource consuming. Another proprietary alternative for old hardware is, as usual, Windows 98, but would you venture to make it your OS? I wouldn’t. Thus, for my media center I’ve acquired the following:

- Microstar mother board with Intel P3/800MHz

- The software that goes into Red Hat Enterprise Linux, we may or may not compete with at a feature level, but the real value of open source from Microsoft is understanding how community developed software can happen on our platform and help grow our business as well as the open source community, which is how we started off on this whole path of launching things like Port25 and CodePlex, and which is why I submitted the licenses to the OSI.

+
  So, Microsoft has finally discovered that good software does happen outside their controlled “cathedral” model, and want to be able to lure communities to help grow their business. I believe Microsoft has done plenty to push away free software developers; many of them frequently asked them: stop threatening them with patent law suits; stop trying to relegating free software development to unpaid, lone programmers in a loft; stop trying to shove your XML format down OSI’s throat. I can only second those requests. 
+
  Then, there’s InformationWeek’s question: 
+
  
- InformationWeek: Are there any specific areas where you would see Microsoft placing things in an open source development environment as a way to further its own products or to better interoperate with things? 
+   InformationWeek: Are there any specific areas where you would see Microsoft placing things in an open source development environment as a way to further its own products or to better interoperate with things? 
  
+
  I definitely cannot prove that Mr. Hilf wrote this question. However, I feel undeniably suspicious about the wording (“further its own product”)? I may well be wrong, obviously. Mr. Hilf however, provides an answer capable of causing a life-threatening stomach ulcer to many free software developers: 
+
  
- Hilf: When people buy commercial software, really what they’re buying is a guarantee. You’re buying a guarantee that what you have will perform, and has been tested and there’s someone you can call up, and if things go really bad someone’s liable if something doesn’t work. You’re buying this ecosystem of accountability. One of the challenges of open source and really the challenge with the open source business model is: it’s hard to replicate that ecosystem of accountability and that guarantee.

  #An overview 
- If you don't already have the  xclip  utility on your GNU/Linux system, install it now from your distribution's repository. Only two of the  xclip  commands are used in a CoPa script, as shown here:  
-  #!/bin/bash

+  #!/bin/bash
 
 xclip -o \
-
 | [some command or commands] \
-
 | xclip -i
   
+
  The first command,  xclip -o , makes the contents of the X selection clipboard available to another program. You load that clipboard simply by highlighting some text – no need to use  Ctrl + c  or 'Copy' from the Edit menu. The X clipboard contents are then sent (piped) to another program, where the highlighted text is changed in some way by a command. Next, the changed text is sent back to  xclip , where the command  xclip -i  loads the changed text into the X clipboard. The changed text can then be pasted simply by middle-clicking – no need to use  Ctrl + v  or Edit/Paste. ('Middle-clicking' means pressing the middle button on a 3-button mouse, or pressing the scroll wheel on a scrolling mouse, or simultaneously left+right clicking on a laptop.) 
+
  If you've never played with scripts before, here's the key: a script is just a simple text file. You write the script in a text editor (or copy/paste it) and save it somewhere handy as  [something].sh . I save all my scripts in a folder called 'scripts' (/home/bob/scripts) because I'm really not very imaginative! Make the script executable by changing the file properties. A quick way to do this in most Linux distributions is to right-click on the script in your file manager, go to Properties, and choose 'Allow this file to run as a program' or its equivalent. 
+
  Now put a launcher icon on your desktop or panel, so that clicking on the icon launches the CoPa script. The way you do that will vary with your Linux distribution and your preferences, but in all cases you should be able to browse your file system to choose the application or command to be launched by that icon. Browse to your  something.sh , choose it and you're ready to go.

  These days there's a lot of buzz about "Web 2.0" and making websites more interactive, but what's really going on is a reconnection to the community nature of the internet. Collaboration, cooperation, and the information commons are all ideas that pre-dated the world wide web in the form of older internet technologies. In today's distributed computing environment, though, these technologies have really flourished. Here's a guide to eight that you should consider making use of in building a community around an information commons project of any kind, from multimedia, to hardware, to software. 
+
  
+
  Community-building tools 
+
  The early twenty-first century has brought us some excellent tools for building more sophisticated and responsive communities around peer production projects. Few projects need to deploy more than one or two of these technologies. However, a greater consideration of the community atmosphere and electronic landscape can make a huge difference in the success of your project. 
+
  Free software has played an important part in this technical revolution. As a result, there are free software tools for every one of these categories. In many cases, in fact, the free software tools lead the market. Which particular package you use will depend on what sort of CMS, portal, or hosting you have available to you. 
+
  I can't possibly hope to be comprehensive in listing packages to provide these services, but I have tried to present a reasonable sampling of some of the most popular and/or interesting tools that I could find. For the web-based tools, I've included information on LAMP-based (Linux-Apache-MySQL-PHP) packages, Drupal (a PHP-based CMS, on which Free Software Magazine is based), Plone (a Python/Zope-based CMS, which is what I am planning to use), and a selection of others (based on C, Perl, Ruby, Java, and others). I've also listed sites that provide these features as hosted services, which gives you the option of not having to install anything on your own server. 
+
  Certain technologies—particularly synchronous or visualization tools—rely on alternate client/server technologies. For those, I've listed clients, servers, and infrastructure information (including protocols and libraries) that may be of use. 
+
  Regarding tools for installation on your own server and/or client software to be used by visitors or contributors, I have restricted this list to free-licensed open source software only. However, in the column "Services", I have relaxed this requirement: where there are widely-used, market-leading proprietary software based services, I have included them. This includes services like SecondLife and Yahoo Groups, both of which have been used extensively to promote free software or free content projects. 
+
  Private communications: email and instant messaging 
+
  The most basic communications technologies are those that provide simple one-to-one communication. Email is the traditional way to do this in the free software community, but for a given project, conversations can also happen through forum "private message" (PM) communications or, if immediacy is also desired, through instant messaging technology (and don't forget, there's always the telephone!). 
+
  
  
  Email and private messaging systems provide basic one-on-one communication. Most free software projects just use email, but web-based forum "private message" (PM) messages can be just as effective in a project (Photo credit: Daria Radota Rasmussen/CC-By 2.0) 
  
+
  Email software is ubiquitous of course. Private messaging is usually a feature of "forums" (see the next section). Synchronous "chat" systems are fundamentally different from a technical perspective, though they serve much the same purpose.

  Finding your roots 
+
  Genealogy, the study of one’s ancestry, is a growing industry. Fuelled by on-line resources like Ancestry.com [3] and television programs like the BBC’s “Who do you think you are”, thousands of people are to be found scouring web sites, visiting graveyards in remote locations and ordering obscure birth certificates all in the name of tracing their roots. 
+
  
  Genealogy is highly addictive...you can easily find yourself staring bleary-eyed at the computer at 3am 
  
+
  If you have ever considered tracing your ancestry, there are a few things to note: it takes time, it can create huge amounts of data and it’s highly addictive. Once you start you can easily find yourself staring bleary-eyed at the computer at three in the morning trying to figure out if the person you’ve just found is the same one you are related to. I should also say that it can be highly rewarding—especially when you amaze your relatives with the details of their family history. 
+
  From data to trees 
+
  Managing all that information suggests a database and while it is possible to create your own, there exists an array of software which can ease the task of turning the data you have gathered into a family tree. Much of this is commercial although it is generally at a reasonable cost. Of course, for those who prefer their software to be free there are several applications available [4] and of these GRAMPS is arguably the most popular. GRAMPS stands for Genealogical Research and Analysis Management Programming System. A name which makes me wonder if the acronym or the full name came first. 
+
  Before I plunge into the details of installing and using GRAMPS, take a look at some of the functionality that it provides, as available from the sidebar as shown in figure 1. 
+

-  People : The bedrock of all Genealogy software. In GRAMPS you can store people’s names (birth, marriage and others), multiple addresses (with dates) and events (e.g. marriage, emigration). 
-  Families : People are automatically grouped by last name, you can also link them by relationship to each other. Thus allowing you to produce family tree style reports. 
-  Pedigrees : A visual, interactive layout of a family tree.

Wikipedia is a relative upstart, riding on the wave of success of free software, extending the idea to other kinds of information content. Today, Project Gutenberg, with over 24,000 e-texts, is probably larger than the legendary Library of Alexandria. Wikipedia is the largest and most comprehensive encyclopedic work ever created in the history of mankind. It's common to draw comparisons to Encyclopedia Britannica, but they are hardly comparable works—Wikipedia is  dozens  of times larger and covers many more subjects.

  It's actually a bit hard to say what the exact size of Wikipedia is today, because the log engine that the site used to measure its size started to fail in 2006, due to the enormous size of the database! Since then, there is no direct data available on the total size of Wikipedia, nor on the English language version (the largest language version, unsurprisingly). There is data on some of the less highly populated language versions, simply because they haven't grown so large yet.

  Ever since I first fired up KDE on openSuSE, I’ve been in love. The KDE interface just swept me off my feet. But there’s always been one nagging thing.  Firefox  and  Thunderbird  stick out like two sore thumbs. They don’t look like KDE apps (see figure 1 and figure 4), they don’t work with KDE programs (like KPrinter), and they just don’t feel like they belong in KDE. Luckily, since both of these apps have support for add-ons, it is easy to remedy this.

+
  It’s all free software 
+
  It’s not at all surprising that the OLPC laptop’s operating system will be based on Linux, of course—people do that with just about any new embedded device these days. But the motivation for OLPC goes much deeper than that. Citing the importance of open source as an educational value, Krstić suggested that a programming language “where the program was the source” was what was called for, and the selected language is Python. It makes it particularly easy to make source both available and easy to modify and use, since it is an interpreted environment. This greatly reduces the burden of including the source on each unit (where storage space is limited). 
+
  In his “Dangerous Ideas” presentation, Krstić lamented the “great lie of open source”: namely that it is enough simply to make the source code available for a piece of software (leaving the problem of setting up a development and build environment and learning how to use it as “an exercise for the user”). He also noted that the average user of this laptop is expected to be a 6-year-old gradeschooler. Thus, the laptop goes several steps further: 
+
  
- By using Python, which eliminates the problem of compiling and linking 
- By writing almost all userspace code for the laptop (including the GUI and the  filesystem ) in Python 
- By actually building a “View Source” special function key on the keyboard, as support for the “Develop” activity (one of several activity-based interface elements on the laptop)

  The UKUUG officially voiced many of the objections that were flying around at the time (and still are):

- The BSI approved fast tracking OOXML in the absence of a revised draft despite over 1000 comments to the original draft. 
- Doing so undermines wider faith in the standards bodies themselves. 
- Fast tracking approval in the absence of a single implementation of the format--even from Microsoft--is hard to justify. 
- Rejection of the fast track is not rejection of the standard which should be given greater consideration before approval. 
- Fast tracking a proposed standard requires a high level of consensus. Something distinctly lacking with regards OOXML.

  Since this is a computer magazine, I should probably start with my computing history: I used one of the first Macs when they came out, later built my own PC at the expense of having to use Windows, switched to Linux in 2002. I’m 27 years old, native to Germany, and I studied Economics and Business Administration in Germany and the US.

   TM: Can you briefly explain what klik is?  
+
  It’s probably the easiest way to download and run software on your PC. 
+
   TM: When did you start working on klik? What inspired you?  
+
  I had the idea in April 2003 when I was thinking of ways to use additional software that didn’t come with the Knoppix Live CD. Back then, I had no idea of how it could be accomplished. In January 2004, klik came into existence, and since then it has been growing into what it is today, thanks to the feedback and help of many users. Today, there is a community of contributors and supporters on the #klik channel on irc.freenode.net, and together we help to drive klik forward. 
+
  The ease of the first Mac inspired me: On the Mac in 1986, you could simply copy an application file to your hard disk and it would run. If you wanted it no more, you could simply move the application icon to the trash. In contrast, Linux 2003 required you to become root, type in cryptic commands, and understand what “broken packages” meant. And you never knew what went on “behind the scenes”: what files were installed all over the place on the system. 
+
  I just wanted to have the same simplicity on Linux that the original Mac had. Plus, I wanted to store my applications wherever I had some space left—be it on a CD-ROM, a DVD, or a USB stick. Linux couldn’t do that: it required me to install everything to  /usr . I felt like the machine was in command of me, not the other way around (as it should be). I felt it was time for a radically different approach: One file per application. 
-  TM: Software installation in Linux is renowned for being susceptible to the “dependency hell” problem. In your documentation, you write: “No dependencies besides base system. No other dependencies are necessary besides what comes already with the base system (distribution).”. However... sometimes, what “comes already with the base system” depends on what the user installed in the first place. I might not have libjpeg in my system, and klik application might need it. What happens in that case? Is there an automatic way of dealing with this sort of problem?

  GNU/Linux can be scary to a new user. After all, what if you mess up? What if you end up corrupting your hard drive so badly that you need to format it to get rid of GNU/Linux? The solution is to use virtualization technology. A virtual machine creates a virtual hard drive as well as a virtual computer, so you can install and run it from within another operating system. If you want to get rid of the virtualized (also known as the guest) operating system, just delete the virtual hard disk from the real (host) computer’s hard drive. 
+
  Introduction 
+
  First, choose which virtualization tool to use. Right now, there are four big ones:  Parallels ,  VMWare ,  QEMU , and  VirtualBox . Parallels is commercial at US$49.99 for Windows and GNU/Linux. For me, that is way too expensive. That leaves us with VMWare, QEMU, and VirtualBox. VMWare has two freeware versions.  One (called a player) runs pre-built operating systems (known as appliances). The other one (called a server) will make machines, but isn't as fast as the professional version. The problem with QEMU is that it is completely command-line (there are GUIs made for it, but they never worked for me). Therefore, it is extremely complicated to create a new virtual machine with it. Besides, it just can’t do some basic things that the others can (like pause a virtual machine, for example). That leaves us with VirtualBox. 
+
  VirtualBox is free software. It is cross-platform (runs on Windows and GNU/Linux, with an Intel Mac version in beta). It runs Windows, OS/2, GNU/Linux, BSD, Netware, Solaris, and L4 guests. And on certain guests, you can install VirtualBox Guest Additions, which lets you share files and more between the guest and the host. The next version, coming soon, will include support for running the pre-built VMWare appliances [1]. It simply works. 
+
  Getting VirtualBox 
+
  Getting VirtualBox varies from platform to platform. There are binaries on the download  site  for Windows, Ubuntu 6.06-7.04, Debian 3.1-4.0, openSuSE 10.2, Mandriva 2007.1, Red Hat Enterprise 4, and the Univention Corporate Server 1.3-2. The SimplyMEPIS site has a guide to installing VirtualBox  here . If you run Ubuntu or MEPIS, you can install  Automatix , which will install VirtualBox for you. Lastly, there is also a generic installer for GNU/Linux on the download page. Unfortunately, there are two versions of VirtualBox: one is freeware and one is free software. These binaries are for the  freeware  version, rather than the  free software  version. For some reason, Innotek (the company behind VirtualBox) hasn’t released open-source edition binaries. I’m not really sure why hackers haven’t released any binaries using the source code (the exception is one by a Macintosh programmer, who created an unofficial free software OS X 10.4 binary  here ). However, I am sure binary versions of this fantastic piece of software will eventually appear for many different distributions.To compile, visit the  Build_instructions page  at the VirtualBox wiki. GNU/Linux and Windows are supported, with Macintosh OS X (Intel-only) and OS/2 in testing. 
+
  Setting up your first virtual machine 
+
  Now that VirtualBox is installed, create your first virtual machine. Your first guest will be the well-known Ubuntu. Download the 7.04 Desktop edition CD image  here . When it finishes downloading, open VirtualBox (on GNU/Linux,  LD_LIBRARY_PATH=. ./VirtualBox , on Windows, run  VBoxSDL.exe  in the folder you compiled it in). 
+
  Select the “New” button (or hit  Ctrl + N ). A “New Machine Wizard” window should pop up (figure 1). 
+
  
  
  Figure 1: New Machine Wizard 
  
+
  Click “Next”. Then, type a name for the virtual machine (I typed Ubuntu). Choose Linux 2.6 (the standard for most modern Linux distros) for the OS type, then hit “Next”. You will be asked how much memory to give. Choose 256MB. For most GNU/Linux distros, you’ll need at least 256MB of RAM to be comfortable (you’ll also need to make sure you have at least 512MB of total physical RAM and have all possible programs closed). Next, you will be confronted with an option to create a hard disk (figure 2).
