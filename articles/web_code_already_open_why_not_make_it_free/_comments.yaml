    body: 'Articles such as the above, always bring to my mind one particular court case I read about and which still sticks in my craw (original story here- http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10329965&pnum=1, summarisation here- http://www.artbash.co.nz/article.asp?id=1009), and although the case itself does not involve software or the like, it does involve intellectual property and the public viewing of such. Whilst most of us in the technological world are smart enough to know and realise that someone else''s work is "someone else''s" intellectual property, and that its creator has the enviable right to determine the ensuant use of the property once it becomes public (and this concept is after all, the basis of a Copyright Act), others deem to perceive differently. Okay, many, many people just ignore intellectual property, and plagiarise and copy to their hearts content, but to have such acts sanctioned by a dim-witted, technology-illiterate lawyer behind a bench?'

    body: "Hmm are you saying that the Web is not part of the \"real world\"? Do different laws apply here then? If so why? I dislike the term Intellectual Property because its definition is so fluid. IANAL but that strikes me as a dangerous thing.\r\n\r\nAnyway if a sculpture is in a - outdoor - public place, does the artist or anybody else have any rights over use of photographs containing it? I would say not. No more than say the architects have over images of buildings they have designed on tourist apparel anyway. \r\n\r\nBut that aside I'm not sure I see too many parallels here. What I am talking about is studying and mimicking HTML code to see how something was done not placing a screenshot of the original site as the main content of yours. The latter would strike me as being more akin to selling t-shirts with a photo of a sculpture in a public place. If the person making the t-shirts had studied the way the sculpture was made and used that to make similar ones then there would be a greater parallel here.\r\n\r\ncheers\r\nRyan\r\n--\r\nEquitas IT Solutions - fairness, quality, freedom\r\nhttp://www.equitasit.co.uk"

    body: "A sculpture is only duplicated when you make a 3D copy. A photo is a new work of art. The fact that it documents a sculpture doesn't make it a copy of the sculpture.\r\n\r\nThis is a fairly old precedent, if I'm not mistaken. And it's a good thing too -- the clamp down on free expression that would result from not being able to photograph in public spaces because you might infringe some sculptor or architect's \"copyright\" would be ridiculous.\r\n\r\nThat's not what copyright is for.\r\n\r\nThere is no entitlement to claim every last penny of possible value to society from an artist's work. Copyright is an exemption, a special monopoly granted as an exception to free speech solely to allow artists to reclaim _some_ value from their work. It must be limited both in time and scope to be at all reasonable or consistent with free society. It doesn't cover everything and _it's not supposed to!_\r\n"

    body: "Ryan, if you believe the web to be the 'real world', that is your personal perspective, but I do not share the same view. (\"IANAL but that strikes me as a dangerous thing\"; do you actually use acronyms when talking face to face?). \r\n\r\nTerry- copyright law concerning photographing in public places is more about recognising the impracticalities of governance-of-constraint, especially in unconfined spaces. Person's photographing a sculpture in a park do not \"not recognise\" the creator of the masterpiece or seek to diminish his/her part in its creation. Also, a two dimensional image of a three dimensional object, is still considered, in most people's minds, a copy (you ask them... I have). Besides this, that wasn't my point, nor the subject of the legal complaint, nor the argument of those many, many people that rallied beside the sculptor (consumer watchdog groups included). Our point was and still is, the total (perhaps contemptuous) disregard demonstrated by a company (and subsequently, the lawyer) toward an artist, when said company sold and collected one hundred percent of the profits from an article of clothing which received major added-value and popularity, by using an image of that sculptor's work on said article of clothing. In other words, it acted like it 'OWNED' the image. (The company subsequently admitted and apologised for it's behaviour toward the sculptor but has used the outcome of the litigation to protect its financial interests.) This aside, my comment in response to Ryan's opinion piece was regarding the exploitation of another person's work, and the fair consideration due to the original author (mentor) when a person knowingly relies on, or duplicates that work. Many coders (contributing and original) do recognise the work of others and pay tribute where necessary, but most appear not to care a damn...\r\n\r\n\r\n...and to no-one in particular (because the author was never recognised though he/she looks like a very smart cookie), \"Hey mate, that's a brilliant piece of code, really innovative. Did you write that? I know hundreds of people who couldn't understand it, let alone create it from scratch."

Of course I do: TV, ISA, USB, PC and BBC to name but five but perhaps you weren't referring to those types. Oddly -- or not -- when I speak I often use colloquialisms, contractions and other (probably bad) habits that I do not always use when writing. I apologise if my use of an acronym changed your view of what I had written but I will probably use others in the future.\r\n\r\n\\-\\-  \r\nEquitas IT Solutions - fairness, quality, freedom\r\nhttp://www.equitasit.co.uk"
