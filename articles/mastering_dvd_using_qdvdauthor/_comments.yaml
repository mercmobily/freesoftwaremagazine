It's just a draft with a scratch audio track; when an official version is ready there will be some sort of clear announcement!\r\n\r\nNot that exposure for the scratch track is bad, obviously: the whole point is for people to try their own hand at re-recording the song in their own arrangements.  But it might be good to label it as a draft."
