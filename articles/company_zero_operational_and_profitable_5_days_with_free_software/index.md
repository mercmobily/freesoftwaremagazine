Everything started with a simple question my wife asked me: you are so good at teaching, why don't you do it? Given that I will only ever work in my own term, I would have to organize everything on my own: incorporation, web site, stationery, advertising, the lot. Chiara's question was natural: well, you can do all that basically for free with Free Software, right?

Right. So, the adventure begins: the bet is that I will have a company, zero to profitable (that means with customers, bookings, etc.) in 5 days.

Today, the 11th of January, is when everything is starting. By Wednesday next week, I will need to have:

**Technology related**

* Logo/Company letterhead
* A professional company web site
* A system to handle bookings
* A phone number
* A professional letter on the course

**Others**

* A domain name
* Material to sell
* Corporate phone line
* Entry in yellow pages and white pages

I will keep everybody updated; I will obviously focus on the free software aspect of things. However, I will also cover some of the other points.

Wish me good luck!
(And wish me a happy birthday too!)
