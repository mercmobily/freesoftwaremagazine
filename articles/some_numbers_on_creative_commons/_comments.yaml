    body: "That's possible, of course. There are a lot of reasons why the numbers wouldn't be totally representative.\r\n\r\nHowever, if you link to CC licenses on every page, don't you mean to license every page under that license?\r\n\r\nIf so, then those are legitimate hits -- the numbers are tracking your production along with others and with newcomers.\r\n\r\nIt's very unlikely, however, that a fixed number of authors would produce exponential growth (you'd have to be constantly increasing your own production -- just continuing at the present rate would produce linear growth). The exponential growth almost certainly means that the numbers are dominated by increasing numbers of people using the licenses.\r\n\r\nYou might think that this probably indicates that most new content is just textual (blogs), but in fact, there are other numbers suggesting that significant amounts of this data are represented by images, sound, and video. In those cases, I imagine sites like Flickr which make selecting CC licenses easy are at work.\r\n\r\n"

    body: "You talk about:\r\n\r\n<cite>... the widely-held belief in the free-software community that the non-commercial and non-derivative variants are stunting the growth of free licenses for cultural works</cite>\r\n\r\nYou also mention Richard Stallman. It might be interesting to note that neither Non-commercial nor \"No derivatives\" is the major problem for Richard Stallman.\r\n\r\nRichard Stallman mentions that licenses should at least give the right to make verbatim copies for non-commercial purposes. So, CC-BY-NC or CC-BY-ND are not among the \"bad\" licenses.\r\n\r\nThe problematic CC licenses are one kind of Remix license that doesn't allow non-commercial verbatim copying (file-sharing), but only derivatives. (The problem is that such a license wouldn't stop the RIAA lawsuits.) And the \"Developing Nations\" license, which is pretty restrictive unless you're in Africa.\r\n\r\nIf I understand his position correctly, that is.

    body: "I give Stallman a lot more credit than that. If he were <em>genuinely</em> most concerned about the tiny trace (&lt;1%) using the non-systematic \"CC\" licenses like \"Sampling\" and \"Developing Nations\", then he'd really be off his rocker.\r\n\r\nThe truth is, these are the only licenses that make his claim that \"there is literally no single freedom\" guaranteed by CC licenses truthful, but that's an obvious stretch to make a point, not a true diagnosis of the problem, and these are not the problem licenses (too few people use them, and almost no one identifies them with the label \"a Creative Commons License\").\r\n\r\nIf any licenses were causing a <em>real</em> problem, it would have to be the NC/ND licenses, because they are the ones which are confusingly identified with the label \"Creative Commons License\" (indeed, the CC-By-NC-SA is the one which is most likely intended by this expression when it is used). I still think it is rather likely that many people using this particular license are subject to some confusion (using NC and SA together suggests the author wants to get \"something for nothing\": commons-like leverage without actually having to put their work in the commons -- and as a practical matter, that doesn't work very well).\r\n\r\nHowever, the numbers show that there's really not much to worry about on that score: the free licenses are showing impressive growth.\r\n\r\nIt stands to reason, of course, that the NC and ND licenses will be more popular -- especially initially -- because they are the ones that require the least adjustment from the \"All Rights Reserved\" business-as-usual of the entertainment and arts industry. If you're a professional who's been creating and selling works under the existing copyright regime, then these licenses require the least from you. So it's a no-brainer that they will be used in greater numbers.\r\n\r\nTruly free-licensed works involve a complete turn-around in thinking: inventing new business models, developing new marketplaces to try them out in, and risking hard work on untried methods. So far, no one has yet come up with a totally satisfactory solution to how to make a living off of producing free-licensed artistic works (I've seen some good ideas, but nothing that works as well as the old system, nor anything that works as well as the already-pioneered systems of making income from free software). Until someone does, there can't be a real revolution in free licensed cultural works.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, they are still booming. I can only conclude, that confusion or no confusion, CC's licensing strategy is not at fault (or not causing any serious damage at any rate). It may even be that artists who try CC's \"semi-free\" licenses are likely to experience success and are therefore more likely to experiment with the free licenses. IOW, it may be that the NC/ND licenses are piloting for the By/SA licenses -- selling the idea to new markets. I know this idea has been promoted by CC representatives in the past.\r\n\r\nI'm inclined to think that the numbers support that hypothesis over the hypothesis that the NC licenses are succeeding at the expense of free licenses."

    body: "It's good news that the fully free licences are doing well. It is a concern for me that people often lump the CC licences together, so when someone says \"this is under a Creative Commons licence\" that's useless information from the point of view of your freedom. It's true that it almost always means that it allows at least noncommercial unmodified copying, but you can't be absolutely sure it's not one of the Sampling or Developing Nations licences. I'd definitely prefer it if they just scrapped those. Another thing I don't like is Lawrence Lessig referring to works which ban commercial use as \"free culture\", but luckily most people don't seem to agree on that and mostly only refer to works which allow the four freedoms of free software as completely free. I think the Definition of Free Cultural Works (http://freedomdefined.org/Definition) is very good, and I hope it becomes the most popular definition of that type.\r\n\r\nA major source for new non-textual CC-licensed works seems to be the music site Jamendo. There's a huge amount of music on there, and it seems to keep increasing extremely quickly. They talk about CC quite a lot, but luckily they only allow music under one of the licences which at least allows noncommercial unmodified copying of the whole work. They also allow the Free Art License, which I think is very good. It's not as professional as the CC licences, but the motivation behind it is closer to the free software movement's, as it takes the view of \"people should have freedom\" rather than \"wouldn't it be good if we made it easier for copyright holders to exert their power more flexibly?\" I've seen that quite a lot of the French language music seems to be under it.\r\n\r\n--\r\nGNU - free as in freedom"

    body: "I think he's concerned most with people lumping together all the CC licenses and referring to them just as \"a/the Creative Commons license\" (which most web sites do, as that's how the CC banners were designed -- not just when they refer to the CC-BY-NC-SA, as you suggest).\r\n\r\nCreative Commons doesn't have any specific freedoms as its goal, and this is how they came to accept these new licenses. Granted, Sampling and Developing Nations are obscure, but it just shows that CC doesn't actually stand for anything.\r\n\r\nI don't fully understand why you say that \"no derivatives\" licenses cause \"real problems\". Isn't that just \"verbatim copying is allowed\", which happens to be the license of Stallman's book \"Free Software, Free Society\". Stallman has repeatedly said that for works of opinion, \"no derivatives\" is useful, so that one's views are not misrepresented. I don't see this as a real problem.\r\n\r\nI personally don't think that NC is such a big problem either. It at least stops the intrusion of the music/movie industries into private homes. When non-commercial uses are allowed, file-sharing, transferring music/movies among devices within your home, etc. all become legal, and the RIAA can stop suing minors.\r\n\r\nOf course, allowing commercial uses as well is the logical next step. (If the GPL wouldn't allow commercial uses for software, it wouldn't be nearly as powerful.)\r\n\r\nEnough of speculating about RMS's thoughts on this. If anyone wants to know about them in detail, they should ask him or get a copy of \"Free Software, Free Society\".\r\n"

    body: "I agree with you that ND licenses have their place (and as you rightly note, I use them from time to time, as does Stallman, although not the CC-By-ND \"brand\"). The issue there is not the validity of the license, but the issue of confusion with more liberal licenses.\r\n\r\nLikewise, CC-By-NC might not be a totally unreasonable license in itself, but the question is, does it cause confusion? And here, the answer from my personal experience is that <em>yes it does</em>.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there is (at least theoretically) a competing effect which is the \"get your feet wet\" theory: that artists will be willing to try a By-NC license who would not otherwise consider free licensing. Then, if they have a good experience with that, some will educate themselves about the licensing issues, and some of those will begin using free licenses at least part of the time. Thus, under this hypothesis, NC contributes to the growth of free-licensed content.\r\n"
