Now this really sounds interesting. [Wired](http://www.wired.com/news/technology/0,70413-0.html?tw=rss.index) is reporting about a new coding tool called [playsh](http://sourceforge.net/projects/playsh/), a coding environment that works just like your favorite MUDs (multi-user dungeons). It combines the collaborative and spatial advantages of MUDs to give coders a new edge. I’m really excited about this product. I spent a sizable portion of my youth playing MUDs and hacking. Now I can do both!


>playsh is a narrative-driven “object navigation” client, operating primarily on the semantic level, casting your hacking environment as a high-level, shell-based, social prototyping laboratory, a playground for recombinant network toys.

What do you think?
