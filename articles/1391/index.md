OK, so according to one of my friends I have way too many blogs out there and I should stop posting, but really I can’t see the problem.

I use blogs as a way of communicating with readers—I write a lot, not just for [Free Software Magazine](http://freesoftwaremagazine.com) but also for [Linux Today](http://www.linuxtoday.com), [Serverwatch](http://www.serverwatch.com), [IBM developerWorks](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks), [Computerworld](http://www.computerworld.com/blogs/brown) and of course one or two books :)

I also use blogs as a way to publish information in a way that is easy to use (from my perspective) and easy for my readers to read and subscribe too (through RSS feeds, as well as natively through the site). I also use separate blogs so that it is easier for individuals to focus on specific information. I have a wide variety of interests and experience, not just in the FOSS space but also with Microsoft, Solaris, HP-UX, Mac OS X, printing, graphic design and a whole host of other stuff. Now imagine putting that into a single blog...

So, this new blog here at FSM is where I’m going to concentrate on my free software and open source thoughts and I’m really planning on this being a source for more technical material that doesn’t fit into one of my other existing blogs. Notice the word planning. Although I do often write thoughts that spring to mind, I like to plan content, so you can expect to see common themes and threads as well as occasional requests for suggestions on content. For example, I’ve planning on posting some information on how to use some FOSS tools we all know and love for IT Admin, only they are not the ones you might expect!

If you want a more generalized look at all of the professional material I write you may want to take a look at [MCslp.com](http://mcslp.com). For an aggregate look at all of the blogging and sites I use and manage, use [Planet MCslp](http://planet.mcslp.com).

Any questions, please feel free to get in touch.
