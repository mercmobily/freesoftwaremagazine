    body: "Personally, I think you slightly missed the point here. SDLBlock is a clone of an old (1989) Tetris clone - Blockout. The latter was a great game, at least at the time it was written and released. I ensure you that it was pretty addictive ;-) More information about it on <a href=\"http://www.abandonia.com/games/en/559/Blockout.htm\">Abandonia</a>.\r\n\r\nWhat's interesting, the original version still has a bunch of very devoted fans. They even have a webpage for submitting high-scores at <a href=\"http://www.blockout.de/\">http://www.blockout.de/</a>. So, obviously there are people who find the interface, and the whole idea of a 3d-Tetris, amusing and enjoyable.\r\nIt's hard to expect that a clone will be different from the original - they wanted to reflect an old game, so the old game (and graphics & interface) you get.\r\n\r\nJust to make things clear."

Pause would make it all to easy! O_O. Have fun!'
