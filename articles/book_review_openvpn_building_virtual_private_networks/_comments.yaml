    body: "This book is just perfect for us in the third world who are trying to employ every bit of technology at minimum cost. An OpenVPN solution would surely beat the cheapest Cisco concentrator or even the cheapest Linux-based appliance out there. Right now, our VPN solution runs on PPTP and it surely sucks!\r\n\r\nI just hope that I get to win this book so that we can add to our expertise and in return, help those small SMEs and NGOs improve their network services.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://hackitlinux.com\">HackItLinux</a>, One of the Linux Pit stops for News"
