# Poll Results—Who should be the next president of the United States?

We went for a little light hearted fun this week, and it turns out that the out and out winner of this little comp is Richard Stallman, who romped home with 59% of the vote. Maybe we should suggest he runs... Stallman was followed by Linus Torvalds with 23%, Steve Jobs with 16%, and lagging behind was Bill Gates at 14% and most of his votes were from people who want him out of the IT industry. Read more [here](http://www.freesoftwaremagazine.com/polls/who_should_be_the_next_president_of_the_united_states) and stay tuned for...


# This fortnight’s poll

[How worried are you about trusted computing, DRM, and software patents?](http://www.freesoftwaremagazine.com/polls/trusted_computing_drm_and_software_patents)

Do you think Digital Rights/Restrictions Management, Trusted/Treacherous Computing and software patents spell the end for free software, will the powers of good prevail, or will the outcome fall somewhere between these extremes? Please let us know your thoughts by voting and by commenting.
