Greetings everybody!

At the moment, we are looking for tutorial-style articles for Free Software Magazine.

Some of our readers pointed out that our magazine is focussing more and more on "opinions", and we are forgetting how to get our hands dirty.

<!--break-->

While we assure you that we will definitely continue to publish editorial articles, we realise that our favourite magazine could do with more practical contents.

**If you want to write short tutorial-style articles and get paid for it, please get in touch with us!**

All articles will be edited and released under a free license.

Contact us directly by emailing us: "proposals" followed by "freesoftwaremagazine.com".

We look forward to hearing from you!
