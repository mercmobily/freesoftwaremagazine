Right now (it's actually always been like that) these manufacturer receive big discounts on licenses for Windows. Without these discounts, a laptop would be way more expensive than it currently is. No manufacturer wants that. After all they are going after the profit. \r\n\r\nBTW, let's see how this Novell/Microsoft deal goes. PC manufacturer may be uncomfortable in supporting an OS that may \"\"potentially\"\" violate Microsoft IP."

Let's support those, buy those en masse and Dell, HP and others ought to notice it soon enough that they're losing customers to these smaller players. \r\n\r\nAnd if they don't, then let's bury them altogether and create new leaders out of the GNU/Linux PC companies. ;)\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nDanijel"

    body: "I feel that you are pretty well spot on in your observations. One of the major stumbling blocks which I believe most users are well aware of is that Linux is still not \"understood\" by the majority of PC & Software Vendors and for many of them there doesn't appear to be any real reason for them to go out and check it out. In many cases it is easier to believe the myths that it is still an Operating System only for geeks.\r\n\r\nAs with most things these days there needs to be a CARROT. In just a quick think about this I believe that if more of the younger generation are to be converted over to using Linux then sad as it may be, that will only come about if they are given some fantastic GAME/Sim/Whatever, that is different from anything else on any other platform. The term often bandied about is THE KILLER APP. I don't think an Application (as in Office product for example) is going to do it for the younger set BUT may well do it for the Business Sector or those interested in things other than games. I feel it needs attacking on both fronts, as an entertainment medium and as a productive tool for businesses and individuals.\r\n\r\nOn the Small Business front something like MYOB is a staple of many such concerns. Just imagine if there were a true alternative to MYOB that did EVERYTHING that MYOB did and preferably something more and/or better. That or some application of the same ilk would I believe then provide a potential reason for an interest and following to develop.\r\n\r\nIt is also imperative that Linux be portrayed more and more often as a POLISHED product that ANYONE who currently uses a Windows or Apple system can happily use without fear of needing assistance to overcome printing issues, etc. That is going to take some serious consultation with Hardware providers, System Builders and the like. Of course it also will involve the numerous IT related media getting on board with a comprehensive promotion of what Linux has to offer.  To a degree there has been some sign of this of late with the late releases of Ubuntu. Most press coverage has been quite positive which is encouraging given the amount of work put into this particular distribution and its current stability. Stability is exactly what Linux needs.\r\n\r\nIn getting back to the topic of Laptops, sure your bet revolves around Linux and the Laptop but I don't believe that the Laptop is likely to be the driver, Linux itself needs to be the driver, people must want Linux first and then be asking for it on their Laptops.\r\n\r\nIt is a brilliant OS for Laptops especially now with the soon to be released VISTA.  If ever there were an opportunity to promote one of the virtues of Linux over Windows it will be Linux as opposed to Vista on Laptops.  The hardware needs to gain full use of Vista are ridiculous whereas Linux is quite attainable.\r\n\r\nWell that is enough of my rabbling on for one evening and seeing as though Daylight Saving is only new to this neck of the woods (Perth Western Australia) it is time I hit the sack to let the body clock become a little more accustomed to it.\r\n\r\nTony, thanks for your contributions to a great magazine.\r\n\r\nRegards...

    body: "All your points make total sense but perhaps one reason we don't (yet) have major vendor distributing GNU/Linux pre-installed is because of the historical nature of GNU/Linux users.\r\n\r\nGranted the tide is turning but until recently the average GNU/Linux user was (by necessity) someone who was quite happy wiping a hard disk and installing their preferred free OS. Traditionally they were also people who knew their hardware and what were quite specific about what they wanted. Okay maybe this is just me then :o)\r\n\r\nWhen some vendors experimented[1] with selling machines with (usually Red Hat) GNU/Linux pre-installed the take up was not as big as they might have liked and I think this is because those vendors were not the ones the average GNU/Linux user (at the time) would have bought from.\r\n\r\nBut - as I said - the tide is turning more <a href=\"http://www.computerweekly.com/Articles/2007/01/03/220855/quarter-of-firms-on-linux-by-2009-say-analysts.htm\">businesses are turning to GNU/Linux for critical business applications</a> [ComputerWeekly.com] and as this starts to happen then it opens doors for other uses. One possible outcome from this is that GNU/Linux on the desktop may look more attractive and these businesses will be asking their suppliers for it. As you say if enough people ask... . Of course another possibility is that the businesses will never ask because their suppliers are M$ houses only. We can but hope.\r\n\r\nAs some customers have a tendency to buy what their supplier tells them to perhaps the supplier needs to be convinced by other market forces. Perhaps what it will take will be a ( for now ) small GNU/Linux PC vendor to start doing some big numbers. Sony switched into the video game market because the CEO read a report that video games were outselling music in the USA. If GNU/Linux users started buying pre-built systems from the smaller (and okay more expensive) suppliers then the bigger (and cheaper) guys would take a bit more notice.\r\n\r\nFinally for an OEM to take up GNU/Linux some more distro's will need to work harder at giving OEM's an easy setup scenario. Images are available from Ubuntu (and some others I believe) which allow an OEM to install and the end-user to run through a start-up wizard a-la Window$. Without that the OEM needs to set the root and user passwords and then instruct the user on how to change them. Hardware support they can handle (sort of) and as for software support, any supplier who has good user forums also frequented by support staff, simple directions for security updates and gives good first-time user docuemntation (anyone remember when your PC came with it's own manual?) will soon find themselves popular.\r\n\r\ncheers\r\nRyan\r\n\r\n[1] and I mean *experimented* I have yet to see a large vendor really take a risk - on anything let alone GNU/Linux. :o)"
