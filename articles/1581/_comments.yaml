    body: 'Yes, truly a problem, but one that is getting much better over time. Yesterday I upgraded my Ubuntu distribution by changing one file then running apt-get dist-upgrade. Whoosh 746 MB of upgrades and a smiling happy coffee drinking over stressed developer relaxed within 15 minutes. Sure things like WiFi for me have the cold feeling of painful playtime, but just think of the pleasure of telling your grand children how you solved a specific issue with lsprob while juggling vi replace tokens. No just kidding, the situation is getting better. Look at how easy installing a printer driver using a <a href=http://www.freesoftwaremagazine.com/articles/printing_ubuntu>CUPS</a> wizard is these days'

Apparently my current bandwidth woes are not due to filling the upstream pipe, but due to straightforward antenna feed problems.

    body: "<p>Sure, but actually, the things you're talking about all have to do with things we have some control over. But educating folks from your local rural wireless broadband company is a long, hard battle. Business has always run on \"a little grease between the cogs\" -- the little lies and fudge-factors that we tolerate, which may actually be illegal or non-compliant to standards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Engineers know this, and they expect to have to do a little fudging and experimenting any time two independently developed systems have to interact, even when theoretically everything should \"just work\" because of standards compliance. However, when we rely on standards for the end-user experience, things get sticky. There's a certain amount of \"engineering moments\" that we just can't protect the end user from, if we are using a free platform.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The temptation is to insist on particular platforms whenever dealing with end-users, and this is the source of much of the market pressure against GNU/Linux.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I don't know what to do about it, but it's an obstacle. Of course, as the platform gets more widely used, it will gradually be able to compete as a standard desktop <i>platform</i>. But I think that's still years away. Especially out here \"in the sticks\".</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n"
