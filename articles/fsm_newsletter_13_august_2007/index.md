Your comments on articles, issues, and blog entries are very welcome. They provide other readers with insightful suggestions, further information, and the feeling that they are not alone. They also provide our authors with the feeling that they are being heard.

Avatars are a great way of expressing your personal identity, whether it be a photo or an image that you feel represents the you you want to be. Read more about avatars [here](http://www.freesoftwaremagazine.com/node/1713). To add an avatar: log in, go to "my account" in the menu on the left, go to the "edit" tab and scroll down to where it says "Upload picture". Now, hit the browse button, find the image on your computer that you want to upload and go to the bottom of the page and hit the submit button. That's it; you now have an avatar image.
