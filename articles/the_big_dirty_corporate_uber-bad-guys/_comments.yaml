    body: "The unbridled effrontery of M$ aside, I got rid of Google somewhere back in Mandrake 9x. Searches I'd 'Googled', hours, or even days before, would keep popping up in my browser again, and this suggested an unhealthy level of intrusive behaviour on the part of Google.\r\n\r\nWhen Google dobbed in that journalist to the Chinese government, because their market share could have been threatened otherwise, they made me want to throw up. He's probably still in some Gitmo gulag, getting re-educated, while Google's stock prices continue to soar.\r\n \r\nWith the probable exception of M$, most software and services companies begin life by providing the best product they are able for their customers.\r\n\r\nAs they climb the corporate ladder, their primary obligation, to their customers, gets subverted by the demands of their shareholders, for ever increasing profits.\r\n\r\nThese 'investors' don't care whether the company is selling software or cluster-bombs. They don't care that the CEO lays off half of the development staff and tries to get the remainder to do the same amount of work for reduced wages. They couldn't care less that the company is driven  to amoral business practices to maintain the golden river of loot, so long as their pockets continue to get lined.\r\n\r\nIn the face of these demands, the only remaining path, for the CEO, is ever upwards, towards eventual monopoly.\r\n\r\nThe customers are virtually forgotten. Costs are cut and profits are maximised, by any means, fair or foul.\r\n\r\nIf there are any competing products, then they must be taken over, or driven out of business, so all potential profits flow into the pockets of the CEO's own shareholders.\r\n\r\nThe entire corporate structure, and their attendant financial parasites, hate the free software community, because we short circuit this self-defeating cycle of greed.\r\n\r\nThat is why we continue to face monstrous legislation like IPRED2, which, incidentally, passed the first reading at Strasbourg the other day.(see “Act now on next week's EP vote on IPRED2” in Free Software Magazine - p2)"
