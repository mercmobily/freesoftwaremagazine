For this reason I use OpenOffice, which works fine on Linux and Windows. Furthermore, I don't like a software vendor to scramble my intellectual property to a closed format. The feature offered in OpenOffice are more than sufficient in my work. When the need arise to communicate content, I use the build in option to convert it to pdf.\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>Comment from: Haakon Meland Eriksen [Visitor] Ã‚Â· http://far.no/</strong>\r\n\r\n    2006-03-12 @ 01:07\r\n    I use OpenOffice 2, but I don't think Microsoft is very worried about OpenOffice. What worries Microsoft is older Microsoft products. If people don't feel the need to upgrade, you are living on old money until they run out.\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>Comment from: Hans Bezemer [Visitor] Ã‚Â· http://hansoft.come.to</strong>\r\n\r\n    2006-03-13 @ 09:53\r\n    I use OpenOffice only as a way to communicate with the \"ignorant outside world\" ;-) I have used WordPerfect 5.1 until 2000 and after that I adopted LyX. LyX is aeons ahead of MS Office.\r\n\r\n    Don't bother about the layout, just write content. When it dies (which rarely occurs) it saves your document first. I've written documents of 300+ pages, and it works smoothly even at the 100th picture or page. Tables of contents are automatically generated, just like headers, footers and pagenumbers.\r\n\r\n    It generates crisp and professional looking PDF, HTML, plain text, LaTex, DVI, etc. etc. The files are plain text. My productivity is boosted at least 100%, hammering out 20-30 pages a day. I love it. Never gonna switch again..!\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>Comment from: Karl O. Pinc [Visitor] Ã‚Â· http://www.meme.com</strong>\r\n\r\n    2006-03-13 @ 18:46\r\n    I agree with Haakon Meland Eriksen, Microsoft has to convince people who already have a working Office Suite to shell out the money for something new. If they can't keep the re-sales churn going they won't be able to justify their stock price. As soon as Microsoft loses it's reputation for invinciblity in the market their monolopy status is toast. When the pointy haired boss hears that Microsoft's stock has tanked he'll be more willing to consider alternatives and Micosoft will have to go back to being just another corporation.\r\n\r\n    It happened to IBM, it will happen to Microsoft.\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>Comment from: Praveen [Visitor] Ã‚Â· http://www.scluk.com</strong>\r\n\r\n    2006-03-14 @ 08:10\r\n    I use openoffice for my daily work. It has most of the features that i require. Micrsoft should support the open document format or a xml based open standard and enter into a open competition rather than following proprietory formats and playing a monopoly role.\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>Comment from: Richard [Visitor]</strong>\r\n\r\n    2006-03-14 @ 09:08\r\n\r\n    I seen the pain caused by working with the intuitive, easy to administer Windows system every day in my work, yet at home my SUSE Professional 10 installation is a joy to work with. My previous employer used Java and Linux and that was more fun too.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Perhaps we're ahead of the game here - trying to do new things like Dot-Net-2 and minimum privelage configurations. Windows doesn't lend itself to minimum privelage, and Dot-Net-2 doesn't mix well in a Dot-Net-1 environment. The class libraries for either don't feel as well thought out as Java's and the stupidly expensive development environment is lightyears behind Eclipse for serious work\r\n\r\n\r\n    So much innovation happens in the Non-Microsoft world, and so much better comes of it - I really hope Microsoft's stranglehold on businesses through Office is broken. The new Office seems designed to lock business in even more strongly than they already are. It ties to Microsoft server, which ties to Active Directory, which ties to a wholly Microsoft implementation. The DRM features strongly lock users into Office.\r\n\r\n\r\n    A lot of these dinosoar ads are pushing the DRM features. I hope the \"Pointy Haired Bosses\" of the world don't continue to believe the hype (Microsft hype is always wonderful) and don't just fall for this.\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>Comment from: Haakon Meland Eriksen [Visitor] Ã‚Â· http://far.no/</strong>\r\n\r\n    2006-03-17 @ 17:55\r\n    Breathe freely with free software! :-)\r\n\r\n    A nice slogan, but seeing is believing - explore visually with your boss an ODF file with a ZIP enabled file manager, and drag content.xml from one ODF file to another. Try that with MS produced binaries!\r\n\r\n    Cheers,\r\n    Haakon\r\n"
