It performs amazingly well on my laptop's meager 915 shared memory graphics chip.\r\n\r\nIf you're into the Fedora scene, once FC6 goes final (and right now in the test series), you can enable AIGLX+Compiz from within Gnome via System Menu -> Preferences -> More Preferences -> Desktop Effects.  Just click the \"Enable Desktop Effects\" and enjoy, or file a bug report ;)"

    body: "I'm sorry I don't know the chipset number, but the ATI Radeon 9200 card works pretty well for me. The biggest win with this card is that the free-licensed DRI driver for it works well.\r\n\r\nI have an nVidia on one of my machines, but when I went from the 2.4 to the 2.6 Linux kernel, I lost the proprietary binary driver modules, and simply have not had the time or desire to reintegrate closed-source drivers. I'm planning to spend a little money on buying an ATI 9200 that I know will just work out-of-the-box with Debian.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, from what I hear, the later ATI cards are closed and undocumented, which means this will probably be the last ATI model I buy, too.  Which leaves something of a vacuum.\r\n\r\nI'm hoping that the consumer model of the <a href=\"http://opengraphics.org\">Open Graphics Project</a> video card will be coming out in a year or so (they are currently gearing up to manufacture the prototype/developer FPGA-based boards, which is promising, but there's still a lot of work remaining on the project). When the ASIC-based card hits the market, I'll probably start using those instead of any of the closed proprietary cards.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    body: "I think I made a mistake on my array: I mentioned the 9200 in 2 ranges, while it should be in only one.\r\n\r\nBasically, 3D works solidly on older Radeon hardware, while Rage is something else: it supports 3D operation, but ALL rage hardware (be it mach64-based or 'pure' Rage128, up to and including models higher than the Rage II and Rage Fury) can't support AIGLX or XGL.\r\n\r\nRadeon 7000 to 9200 are based on r100 and r200 cores, which benefited from limited sources released by Ati, thus leading to a very solid free implementation. r300 uses some functionalities from previous generations, and the rest is being reverse-engineered to get a more complete support.

It should work very well with all the other cards (9600) with the free driver.\r\nA 9800 is a nice card, even by today's standards: it supports fully programmable shaders, it's clocked high enough to roar, and, well, I still haven't found a 3D app on Linux that could saturate it.\r\nIf you can find one, go for it - it is a VERY big upgrade over the 9200, which is basically a tweaked and overclocked 8500.\r\n---\r\nA computer is like air conditioning: it becomes useless when you open windows."
