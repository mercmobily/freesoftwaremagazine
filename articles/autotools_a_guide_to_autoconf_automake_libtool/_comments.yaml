Thank you so much.\r\n\r\nIt would be helpful if you could discuss in more detail the concept of \"private\" vs. \"public\" header files.  In particular, where should they reside? (in the same direcotory where the library source files live, or in a separate include directory?\r\n\r\nCould you give some guidelines in choosing a library's directory layout?\r\n\r\nThanks. "

    body: "I don't know whether you still visit this page, but here goes:  I've not been happy with autotools, but there needs to be a solution, and there isn't any other.  Whenever I argue with myself, though, I keep going back to autotools but it's the only shot at developing on one computer (You know, mine, the one in front of me, the one I'm using -- not the 20 I have on my desk because I don't need space for anything else).  I've done the bit where you compile on several different machines/(platforms, environments) and then tailor a makefile for each:  It was great for learning portability lessons, but it didn't serve my audience.  \r\n\r\nThere are some cute packages out there that will lead you to a clean compile if you're developing by yourself and for yourself, but we seldom do that, right?  Just the other day I read a post on a \"software hints\" board where a ranking member suggested that there were only like 9 production variables between the top 3 possibilities for your compiler, machine and operating system through parsing, link-edit and code-generation.  I'd pity him if I didn't envy his choice of reality.  So that's why I applaud your paragraph:\r\n\r\n\"Do you have any idea of the number of build-breaking differences there are between existing systems today? Neither do I, but there is a handful of developers in the world who know a large percentage of these differences. Between them and the free software community, the Autotools were born. The Autotools were designed to create configure scripts and makefiles that work correctly and provide significant chunks of valuable end-user functionality under most circumstances, and on most systems--even systems not initially considered (or even known about) by the package maintainer.\"\r\n\r\nThanks for making the book available.
