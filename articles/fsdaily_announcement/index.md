It's been just over a year and Free Software Magazine has become an authority in the free software world.

Myself (Tony), Dave, Gianluca, Alan and others worked countless hours to create Free Software Magazine from scratch, without involving venture capitalists or investors.

We can only be happy with the result: a quality magazine on free software that gets read by thousands of people each month.

Over time, we found that even though we could publish professionally edited feature articles, we couldn't cover news in real time. In regard to real-time news:


* The introduction of [FSM blogs](http://blog.freesoftwaremagazine.com) increased our ability to provide daily content, but it hasn't been quite enough.
* [Slashdot](http://slashdot.org) does a terrific job providing news to geeksâ€”but they're not at all focused on free software.
* [LinuxToday](http://www.linuxtoday.com) is another fantastic hub. However, LinuxToday focuses on Linux (hence the name), and Linux is only a piece of the puzzle...

This is why we decided to create [fsdaily.com](http://fsdaily.com).

Fsdaily now provides a constant feed of news exclusively about free software. Like Slashdot it's based on [Slashcode](http://www.slashcode.com), which means that it can be used as a hub for the free software community to comment on specific items of news.

So... go and [create your own account](http://fsdaily.com/my/), and enjoy our new site!

And... don't forget to [tell us](http://fsdaily.com/submit.pl) if there is a story you'd like us to cover. If it's about free software, we won't reject it!
