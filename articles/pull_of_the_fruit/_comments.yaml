    body: "Kirk,\r\n\r\nIt is always a major challenge to satisfy the demands of our most important 'customers' isn't it?\r\n\r\nMy problem is worse than yours: we don't have any issue with MacEnvy - we don't even have the MacHinery to play it on - but the defenestration of our happy home is stubbornly resisted by one application that she-who-must-be-obeyed absolutely cannot give up (and I have not been able to replace). At which point even the smoothest approach, eschewing technical jargon but instead laden with many (un)subtle references to beauteous life affirmation, comes to a grinding halt reminiscent only of a dying disk drive.\r\n\r\nIn my spare time (in between peeling grapes) I have been building my first 64-bit machine. I had thought to run OpenSuSE 10 on it, but now with 10.1 and indeed Novell giving away \"final beta\" versions of SuSE Linux Enterprise Server 10 (exp release: July), my eye has been caught by Xen 3.0.2 \r\n\r\nThe big draw WAS the flexibility you described but without the either/or choice. It enables the installation of multiple distros, each in separate Virtual Machines - so you can have your Gentoo and Kubuntu tu, er, too! \r\n\r\nI must admit that my first thought was of the ability to separate 'production' work, eg web server, from 'development' (hey it's only a home machine, but let's use the big words!); and relying upon the virtualisation system to keep things separate and relatively independent (you can divide apples by oranges!)\r\n\r\nThe latest claims by Novell, which I'm sure will only apply to the latest AMD VT (and Intel equiv) chips rather than the Athlon I bought off the shelf today (grrr!!!) is that Xen can even run an unmodified OpSys within a VM, which one is left to assume will include MS-Windows (at last a use for the licence that came with the hardware I have since improved to Linux!)\r\n\r\nThat way I can run my heart's desire in any number of VMs while, er, my heart's desire can still look at the machine through her own window/Windows when she needs...\r\n\r\nWonder if it is really possible? Is love merely a flight of fancy? \r\nGotta go, the pre-Wimbledon strawberries are being served...\r\n=dn\r\n"
