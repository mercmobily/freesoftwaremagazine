    body: "In relation to this subject, which by the way is very enlighting, I would like to remember, those with short term memory loss, that Sun Microsystems already went down that road. Remeber the T1 open hardware project? Where one could access all the blueprints to the T1 motherboard e components? Having access to proper installations (home garage), one could actually build, like the movie ShortCircuit, from parts bought at Radioshack, a motherboard from scratch. \r\nSo essentially this also applies to all kinds of hardware, be it mobile, laptop or whatever. \r\nEmbedded hardware, Systems on a Chip, Arduino, Parallax, Arm, and others teach use to \"play with hardware\" in such a way that was never possible, about 10 years back. \r\nThe other day I came across the elektor magazine on a article \"google search for elektorembedded\" that basically gave away 32bit kit of programmable SoC, in exchange for a video clip of the distruction of our old 8/16bit hardware.\r\nThis 32bit hardware has the collective power of all hardware built in 70 years of the last century, and that you can stick in your pocket or hook up to a solar cell kit and that can actually improve our place among nature and keep us ticking and twitching towards the future.\r\nIt is ever so important that everyone of us remebers the footprint they represent in carbon dioxide, in relation to other, because there are almost 7 billion human beings.\r\nHistory is there to teach us to use our mistakes as leverage points to a better society. It is this kind of thinking that opens up minds. Not only are people getting so used to gadgets, they keep on forgetting about the so called perfect society that some keep on wanting mankind to fall into that they forget the real explanation of the word Progress.\r\nMonopolizing the market with no charge software instead of free software will loom the idea behind the movie Metropolis 2001.\r\n\r\nCarlos Sousa"
