    body: "How can you miss mentioning IAX?  And Asterisk open source?\r\n\r\nA while back I looked deep into VoIP.  I went IAX over SIP over technical matters.  It is a less popular choice for 'consumer grade' but some desk phone sets can do both.  Teliax has good plans for IAX.\r\n\r\nI use Skype too.  The answer to beating Skype is free service.  If someone invents an ad-based revenue model for video, implements open source, and throws in automatic open-source crypto for calls, that will be a Skype killer.  What you're dealing with in Skype is the 'popularity effect' of 'everyone else uses it' so Skype's disappearance would help.  But anyone who offers free service of equal or better quality will soon overtake them."

Voice and video telephony over TCPIP is a killer app, just like a web browser. \r\n\r\nIt's so disruptive, the ISPs and telephone companies conspire to kill any technology of this kind. \r\n\r\nWe must have it, or else we'll always have $100/month cell phone bills. We'll always have slow \"broadband\" at high prices. We'll never get the boot of the content lobbyists off our data-pipes. \r\n\r\n"

    body: "Has anyone ever heard of Ekiga?  Ekiga (http://www.ekiga.net) is open-source VoIP software that I use on my Debian (Lenny) system to great satisfaction.  It works with SIP and H.323.  While I've never used H.323, I have used SIP; I couldn't get video working only because Lenny didn't provide drivers for the webcam I was using and I don't think the IBM Thinkpad T41 I use it on has the throughput for video, anyhow.  However, the audio performance has been crystal clear as if the person is in the other room (sans the delay).\r\nI thought there would be some mention of Ekiga here; I'm somewhat surprised to see that there was none.  An Ekiga account is free but it may be possible that you may have to pay for 'advanced' features.  I don't use these, so I don't know.  The Linux client is by far better on Linux than the Windows client is on Windows.  I don't doubt that many users have had problems with VoIP; I wholeheartedly agree that there must be some kind of NON-proprietary standard set that everyone can conform to and that allows participants (users, providers, etc.) to use and extend VoIP w/o the limitations of proprietarism."
