However, I am concerned that those new to free software may read your comments and believe them to be based on fact, rather than on misguided, unresearched nonsense. So to prevent people from being misled...  \r\nLet's do it:\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------\r\n\"What next? Many already feel that patents should be done away with (even though they are a very small group). Like in a previous article was mentioned, Patent Kills!\"\r\n--\r\n\r\n\"They\" are not a very small group. In fact, we are part of a _huge_ group of people (including many major companies) who are against patents.\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------\r\n\"But in reality, who will actually then develop new medicines, new science, ect.\" \r\n--\r\nDo you know much about how research works?\r\nDo you know that most of the scientific research happens in\r\nuniversities, which are often funded with *your* money?\r\nDo you know who's made the most important discoveries in the last\r\ncenturies?\r\nThe problem is I can tell that you don't. Please, go and do some\r\nresearch.\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------\r\n\"Clearly, we have to agree, what have free software created? Linux? no.\"\r\n--\r\nThe idea that free software \"creates\" something is flawed. Free software is *created* by *people*.\r\nLinus Torvalds happens to have created Linux.\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------\r\n\"It is a derivative of Unix, which started as proprietary,...\"\r\n--\r\nI have to be frank: your ignorance in this matter is grating.\r\nUnix was originally developed in the 1960s and 1970s by a group of AT&T Bell Labs employees, including Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie, and Douglas McIlroy.\r\nUnix's source code was released pretty much from day one, and students were allowed and encouraged to improve it. And, THEY DID.\r\nYour sentence may mislead people into believing that Unix started like Microsoft Windows, and then it got copied.\r\nThis is INCORRECT.\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------\r\n\"Apache? it's just another Unix server.\"\r\n--\r\nJust another Unix server that only has *70%* of the market. Again: grating.\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------\r\n\"GIMP ? Please!...\"\r\n--\r\nGIMP is free and it's great. If you don't like it, don't use it. Many do like it and use it.\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------\r\n\"...and on, and on. The fact is that 99% of all free software is just another copy of a proprietary system.\"\r\n--\r\nWhat on earth are you on about...? I can only respond by saying that 63.56% of statistics are made up on the spot :-P. Now can anybody guess which side of the line your one falls on.\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------\r\n\"Open office is another copy of MS office. Whether MS office is not original is besides the point.\"\r\n--\r\nIt IS NOT beside the point.\r\nThis is how technology and science works. People build upon other people's ideas.\r\n\r\n\"If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of Giants.\" --Isaac Newton\r\n\r\nEverything is a copy of something else (sometimes) with improvements.  The fact that \"MS office is not original\" IS THE point isn't it.\r\n-----------------------------------\r\n\"XEN? c'mon.. there are dozens of VR systems out there. Come up with something new!\"\r\n--\r\nThis is the beauty of free software. Why don't YOU come up with something new?\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------\r\n\"Richard Stallman can arguee all he wants about free software from his good paying job at a great university,...\"\r\n--\r\nI'm sorry, this is news to me: what great university is Richard Stallman working for?\r\nAgain: please, please, please, find out *facts* before spreading your misinformation.\r\nYou can start here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------\r\n\"...but real people need real jobs! Or like Pablo Picasso once said, \"It is very easy to be a communist when you live in Paris instead of Moscow!\". (And no, I am not saying that Stallman is a communist, etc.  It's just that the Picasso quote makes a lot of sense for many of Stallman off based points.)\"\r\n--\r\nFree Software has created a lot of jobs. It's just a different business model. I am not sure if you are aware how it works. You can start by reading our articles! I think it's a great business model. You don't have to. But maybe you should get educated before you pass judgement.\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------\r\n\"Since all the follower will want an example, here it is... Tell a programmer in Brazil or India that his labor should go free for the benefit of society (when his labor is all he has)\"\r\n--\r\nYou are starting from the more forgivable conception that people don't pay for free software. Again, this is wrong. Consultants get good money to write, develop and implement free software in India, America, Europe and everywhere else. \r\n\r\n-----------------------------------\r\n\"He will laugh you out of town! You see, those programmers in third world countries do not have the option that Stallman does, of a good job so he can spout his mouth with rediculous ideas.\"\r\n--\r\nI can't comment on this apart from to say that you obviously have no idea who Richard Stallman is. Fortunately, your sentence speaks for itself.\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------\r\n\"The problem is that most people in the develop world do not understand this concept. They believe, as Stallman does, that people can eat thoughts, instead of real food, provided by real jobs, which developing good for profit software can be one of many.\"\r\n--\r\nYou really do firmly believe that free software cannot be for profit, don't you? Try telling this to Apple, IBM, RedHat, Canonical, and the _many_ companies and consultants out there who make lots of money thanks to free software.\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------\r\n\"I once lived in Utopia too. But I finally came down to my senses and changed my address!\"\r\n--\r\nWell, maybe you should do some research, find out some facts, and write sensible comments OR find another address to post your flawed comments to.\r\nIn the future, I will pass your comments onto the web site only if they don't contain extremely flawed information. We are busy making a magazine, and straightening comments like this out is very time consuming. I would hate to think that someone might read your comments and think you are basing them on facts.\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr/>\r\n\r\n<strong>From</strong>: Eduardo Cruz \r\n<strong>Url</strong>: \r\n<strong>Date</strong>: 2005-12-25\r\n<strong>Subject:</strong> Free, open...\r\n\r\n\r\nTony, you are right.  Most research is done at University level.  But you have to live on the moon not to know that most of it is also pay by private money that will own the patents of any new products or ideas.  They do this not for altruistic reasons as you well know.  For profit!  Goverment does lots of basic research, but percentage wise, the big money is private.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the concept of free software (explain it to me if i am wrong), if I am a programmer in a third world country, and come up with a new idea or software, you would expect me to put my idea into the open/free software license.  This in turn will prevent me from reaping the fruits of my labor and my talents.\r\n\r\nYou see Tony, in my part of the world, we are not all consultants, or magazine editors, etc.  \r\n\r\nIf I were to design an accounting system that works for my country ( like my brother-in-law has done, and sells his program to supermarkets and hotels), free software would want it in the free software license, right? Then how would my brother-in-law would make a living?  Working for Red Hat? Working for you? Will you send him a hand out for being a member of the free software society?  Will you help his kids?  Pay his rent?  That is why I am oppose to that.  If I design or create anything, I would want to use for my benefit.  You do not really see how this affects people outside your little world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut it is so typical.  Just like when developed countries tell the Brazilians not to cut the amazon forest (which in fact they shouldn't), but developed countries do not come up with a plan to supply the poor brazilians with an alternative, money! \r\n\r\nFree software says, create, but put it out for all to see and copy.  I do not care if you starve, we just want our little concept to exist, or go work for one of our great corporations, if we can get you a job.  Again, it is easy to see the world only thru your own eyes.  You guys do not see that the poor has to eat, real food.\r\n\r\nGo back and re-read my Picasso quote.  I think just makes too much sense for you to understand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr/>\r\n\r\n<strong>From</strong>: Tony Mobily  <b>(SUBSCRIBER!)</b>\r\n<strong>Url</strong>: http://www.mobily.com\r\n<strong>Date</strong>: 2005-12-26\r\n<strong>Subject:</strong> Here we go again...\r\n\r\n\r\nEduardo, \r\nYou say things like \"But you have to live on the moon not to know that\r\nmost of it is also pay [sic] by private money that will own the patents\r\nof any new products or ideas\". Do you honestly believe that? I am asking\r\nyou because I happen to have a degree in Computer Science (as well as\r\nEnglish). I haven't done my PhD, for a number of reasons, but I was\r\ndefinitely aware of how our university worked. Through the years, I was\r\nalso under the impression that the university I attended, Murdoch\r\nUniversity, wasn't an isolated case.\r\n\r\nSo, I guess my questions are: have you studied/worked in a university?\r\nCan you back your claims with statistics, examples, numbers?\r\n\r\nYou go on to say \"with the concept of open source [...] you would expect\r\nme to put my idea into the open/free software license\". No, I don't\r\nactually. Nobody does. I expect people to have the freedom to do so, so\r\nthat they can exploit the business model based on free software -- the\r\nsame model I mentioned above (see Red Hat, Apple, etc.).\r\n\r\nThen you write things like \"free software would want it [an accounting\r\nsoftware] in the free software license\". I am not sure what you think\r\n\"free software\" is at this point. You seem to think of it as an\r\nauthoritarian figure that wants all software to be free. This is a\r\ndistortion of reality.\r\n\r\nFree software doesn't /want/ anything. Free software exists. It is\r\ncreated. The free software community stresses the importance of a free\r\noperating system (that was the main point raised by Richard Stallman in\r\nthe very beginning), as well as the importance of free development\r\ntools.\r\n\r\nWhat does your brother-in-law use to compile his programs? Well, if he\r\nwants to, he can use GCC, or Ruby, or Perl, or Python. What does he use\r\nas a database server? Well, he can use Postgres. Or Mysql.\r\n\r\nThe free software community is not going to kick and scream if somebody\r\nin Brazil is releasing a specific accounting program that is specific\r\nfor the Brazilian market. That's his choice -- in fact, it could be a\r\n_good_ choice.\r\n\r\nHowever, he could for example join the GNUCash developers, and\r\ncontribute to GNUCash so that it handles Brazilian rules and laws. He\r\nwould be able to implement what his customers want, and put these\r\npatches in the mainstream GNUCash tree. This would mean that: (1) his\r\ncustomers will KNOW that their software will outlive your\r\nbrother-in-law's computer career; (2) he will be able to give his\r\ncustomers a better accounting program; (3) he would be the best person\r\nin Brazil to contact for support in the use of GNUCash. He could\r\nobviously charge for support.\r\n\r\nThis is just a possibility. In fact, your brother-in-law can also\r\ndevelop a proprietary accounting program, and sell it to his customers.\r\nThanks to free software, he can develop it without spending hideous\r\namounts of money for development tools, and he can even give his\r\ncustomers a free operating system with it.\r\n\r\nAs you can see, there is no need for me to \"help his kids\", or \"pay his\r\nrent\".\r\n\r\nYou do make grating statements like \"If I design or create anything, I\r\nwould want to use for my benefit. You do not really see how this affects\r\npeople outside your little world.\" I don't feel I need to comment on\r\nthis. Fortunately, I think it speaks volumes all on its own.\r\n\r\nI completely agree with you about the Amazon forest. It's absolutely\r\ndisgusting. Fortunately, free software has nothing to do with this.\r\n\r\nIn fact, without free software, Brazilians would be forced to pay a\r\n_lot_ of money in licensing fees to Microsoft, with NO alternatives.\r\n\r\nIn the next sentence, you seem to equate free software to \"our little\r\nconcept\". Of course I only see the world through my eyes. However, I see\r\na world where Venezuela is benefiting _immensely_ thanks to free\r\nsoftware. The same applies to India and many other Asian nations. And\r\nagain the same applies to the US, Australia, and Europe.\r\n\r\nFree software isn't benefiting just corporations: it's benefiting\r\nindividuals, consultants, and private companies.\r\n\r\nRemember that you *can* charge for free software. That is indeed the\r\nbeauty of it. \r\n\r\n\r\n<hr/>\r\n\r\n<strong>From</strong>: Robert Schaper \r\n<strong>Url</strong>: \r\n<strong>Date</strong>: 2005-12-23\r\n<strong>Subject:</strong> Open Source\r\n\r\n\r\nThe author makes the same mistake as Stallman in his Open Source essay. OSS doesn't have a 'philosophy', it's philosophy-neutral and therefore compatible with lots of philosophies (although I guess that in itself is a philosophy too). The idea being to make the movement as large as possible and to not exclude people unnecessarily. It doesn't matter why people are using and creating OSS, be it out of self-interest, altruism or a religious or political motive as long as they do it and do it in numbers. Tying an explicit philosophy to the license is bad strategy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe beauty of the thing is that whatever their motives, even if they are completely selfish, they still contribute to the greater good as OSS by its very nature empowers users.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr/>\r\n\r\n<strong>From</strong>: Tom Chance \r\n<strong>Url</strong>: http://tom.acrewoods.net\r\n<strong>Date</strong>: 2005-12-27\r\n<strong>Subject:</strong> Everything is related to some philosophy\r\n\r\n\r\nHi Robert,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI think you misunderstood the point of the article, perhaps by labouring under a narrow use of the word 'philosophy'. You've really just restated one of my conclusions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs I discuss at the end of the article, Open Source advocates don't explicitly state any genuinely philosophical 'Open Source philosophy', focusing on development methodologies instead. They don't get into stating positions on ethics, political philosophy, the philosophy of technology or any other branch of the subject. But the Open Source approach to software development and licensing, like anything else, is potentially interesting to philosophers. It raises or coincides with philosophical questions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo in my article one of the things I show is that, in terms of various philosophical questions surrounding software licensing, Open Source is more philosophically similar to proprietary software than many might think. That's not necessarily a bad thing, for as you say it allows for a broader church of people to promote the other aspects of the approach (technical, business, managerial, etc) without making people feel like they're also having to swallow some ethical or otherwise-philosophical position.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOpen Source doesn't _have_ a philosophy, you're right, but it does embed all sorts of philosophical assumptions in its approach.\r\n\r\n<hr/>\r\n\r\n"
