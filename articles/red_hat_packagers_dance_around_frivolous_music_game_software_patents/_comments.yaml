    body: "\"The USPTO was supposedly seeking to reform itself in the last few years, but if this is all it has to show, then maybe itâ€™s time to consider a world without patents, and abolish the whole institution? After all, the US federal government has an enormous debt, and wasting funds on an institution that is actively destructive to the purpose for which it was created is not sane policy.\"\r\n\r\nI've heard that the USPTO is actually self-funded.  It makes money.  Which, if true, would explain one of their incentives to accept just about any application.  And a couple of years ago they opened up a gigantic new campus, so you can see that the money is going to good use.\r\n\r\nLet's see what Wikipedia says today:\r\n\r\n\"The USPTO is currently based in Alexandria, Virginia, after a 2006 move from the Crystal City area of Arlington, Virginia. Since 1991, the office has been fully funded by fees charged for processing patents and trademarks. The current head of the USPTO is Under Secretary of Commerce for Intellectual Property Jon W. Dudas, who was nominated to the position by President George W. Bush in March 2004 and was then appointed on 30 July 2004.\"\r\n\r\n----\r\nhttp://www.movingtofreedom.org"

    body: "I think it would be interesting to try to compile a list of \"innovative\" free software packages -- games based on original game mechanics, programs that have no direct proprietary analog (or which predate the proprietary analog).\r\n\r\nIt's perfectly natural to expect that a lot of free software will be \"knock-offs\" of proprietary packages -- after all, many people want to replace packages that they liked technically, but don't like the licensing on. (And to be fair, the proprietary industry creates a lot of knock-offs too).\r\n\r\nBut it tends to overshadow more original work, and that leaves us with the question of just how many _original_ ideas are first expressed as free software.\r\n\r\nI don't feel that has really been answered, and I admit I'm not real sure how to go about measuring it.\r\n"
