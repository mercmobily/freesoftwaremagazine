    body: "A major problem for Ubuntu is that it \r\ndont have so much books/printed matter to support. \r\nI agree they have the most vibrant community. \r\nbut for a novice it is not vey  helpful. Novices need \r\nbooks to hand hold in the process of migration. \r\nEvery other disctribution like fedora, suse, debian etc \r\nhave large number of booksfor this. \r\nAny way this is a good attempt wish you all the best."
