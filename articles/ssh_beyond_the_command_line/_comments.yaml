    body: "Thanks for a nice article!\r\n\r\nI find going through Nautilus annoying since, at least in my environment, it defaults to the root, rather than my home directory.  For those needing a GUI frontend in Gtk+ that doesn't involve digging for your $HOME, I'd suggest looking at gFTP, <code>http://www.gftp.org/</code>.\r\n\r\nFOSS SFTP frontends on Mac OS X include Fugu, <code>http://rsug.itd.umich.edu/software/fugu/</code> and Cyberduck <code>http://cyberduck.ch/</code>.\r\n\r\nAlso, being a GPL SFTP client on Windows, I think FileZilla, <code>http://filezilla.sourceforge.net/</code>, deserves to be mentioned.\r\n"

    body: "first, \"openssh for windows\" appears to be unmaintained with no releases since 2004 and with a statement claiming such on http://www.openssh.com/windows.html.  i don't recommend unmaintained security software.  that page lists an alternative: copSSH.  not that i care much for cygwin, especially application-specific cygwin installations, as it was (is?) troublesome (cygwin applications interact poorly with cmd, native applications interact poorly with bash, different versions of cygwin dll conflict with one another due to versioning of shared memory, etc) and slower than native.  granted, my experience is dated (2004), but was extensive at the time, and i finally gave up in frustration and decided \"when in rome, do as the romans\".\r\n\r\nsecond, i never found ssh to be that useful on windows.  most (all) meaningful windows applications require a gui which means rdp.  for administration, windows is nearly impossible to interactively administrate without the control panel and mmc.  just about every windows application installer assumes a gui, too.  yes, there are ways to administrate and install without a gui, but if you are \"in bed\" that much with windows, you're probably using wsus, login scripts, psexec, etc.  for file transfers?  never had that big of a need as i usually tunnel to a linux box and get it by way of that machine (port forwarding vnc and/or rdp, remote x-windows file manager, or just smbfs).\r\n\r\nthirdly, \"run GUI GNU/Linux applications remotely on a Microsoft Windows host\"?  xming?"

    body: "This is an overly complicated process that can be solved with two small, simple, and free programs:\r\n1) Simon Tatham's PuTTY (http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/)\r\n2) FileZilla (http://filezilla-project.org/)\r\n\r\nFileZilla has some notable features (quoted here from their site):\r\n    * Easy to use\r\n    * Supports FTP, FTP over SSL/TLS (FTPS) and SSH File Transfer Protocol (SFTP)\r\n    * Cross-platform. Runs on Windows, Linux, *BSD, OSX and more\r\n    * Available in many languages\r\n    * Supports resume and transfer of large files >4GB\r\n    * Powerful Site Manager and transfer queue\r\n    * Drag & drop support\r\n    * Configurable Speed limits\r\n    * Filename filters\r\n    * Network configuration wizard\r\n\r\nMy organization manages over 8000 machines and have found FileZilla so useful and simple, we have replaced the aging WS_FTP with it in our base image.  PuTTY is also part of our base image.  Why?  Because it's free, simple and versatile.  If you like command lines, then it also has utilities to work from the command line, especially for SCP.\r\n\r\nAs I stated in the subject line, this article is too much work for the benefit.  Use easier, supported solutions.\r\n"

    body: "the benefit to ssh-gnome integration (gnomevfs) is not necessarily nautilus supporting ssh, but most (all?) gnome applications supporting ssh.\r\n\r\ncorrect me if i'm wrong (it might have been smb, not ssh, that i recently exercised, but i've done something similar with ssh-access under gnome), but recently my wife needed to edit a document (not a plain text file) on a remote server with openoffice.  it just worked.  later we needed to open a remote file with a non-gnome application which required copying the file locally with nautilus, editing it, and copying it back.  my wife didn't care for the multi-step process.\r\n\r\nso yeah, though nautilus might not be the best ssh/sftp/scp client, it's just the tip of the gnomevfs iceberg.\r\n\r\n(btw, to be desktop-agnostic, kde w/ kio slaves is smiliar, if not identical.)"
