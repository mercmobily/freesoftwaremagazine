This is what we need\r\n, so we dont have to sweat it out at an local computer shop , in fear of buying an useless thing that just does not work with linux. Also i would like to know if Ubuntu will be as an oem on Dell in the netherlands. As Dell is making an move in this direction, of supporting linux on one line of their computers.\r\n\r\nThank you very much and keep up the good work."

    body: "Dear Mr. Shuttleworth,\r\n\r\nAs a newbie to Linux jargon I can't quite figure out what the relationship is between the two. As a Mepis user, it seems to be something worth understanding, so I'd love to hear some type of illustration which explains the Mepis-Ubuntu (or Ubuntu-Mepis!) dynamic, such as father/son, or landlord/tenant or something layman-y. (My examples are intentionally simplistic.) I read an article on the subject,  http://www.desktoplinux.com/news/NS7900729752.html\r\nand kinda grasped the idea that Mepis is \"an Ubuntu-derived distro,\" but what does that mean for me as a Mepis user? Which leads to: \r\n\r\nIs there any advantage to the Linux newbie in using Ubuntu? (Long-time expert pointer-and-clicker, I first tried openSUSE last year after getting up the guts to finally try to dual boot my machine, but it was HORRIBLY complex and none of my DVDs worked! I searched around and tried Mepis, and got nice tips during installation, like \"Don't websurf as the root user!\" which I hadn't known in SUSE.) Though Mepis is much easier for me than SUSE, is Ubuntu better for hardware compatibility, or ease of use? (For example after hours of sifting through bulletin boards for help, I find a fix which requires writing scripts, something I haven't the faintest notion of.) \r\n\r\nI'm reading as much as possible but it's slow going and I find myself still using Windows more than I'd like because I can't operate some applications in Mepis.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance if you have time to answer. -z in japan"
