    body: 'I have my first linux install *CD* --Slackware3.0 CD --with the platypus on the front (there was no Tux back then).  It came with the 1.2.13 kernel and as much software as they could pack onto 2 CD''s.  You still had to make boot floppies.  It was harder then.  The booklet that explained everything LInux came with it --a slim 30 pages.  I had to do quite a bit of research to figure out how to build a new kernel, and add command line paramaters to the install floppy to get the install cd to actually load (interrupt in unexpected places caused more problems back then), and I had to hack the kernel to tell it that my cd''s interrupt was somewhere non-standard.  So my first taste of Linux had to include hacking and building a kernel (which I had never done before either).  Great fun that!  Beside the old disk, I have a copy of ubuntu edgy eft (11 years separates them)!  The old stuff worked though, even X windows (FVWM).'

Unfortunately, the version of X11 shipped with sls 1.05 doesn't support that chipset. So, you have to use the VGA driver, not the SVGA driver.\r\n\r\nThe password issue is interesting. I just tried to change my password in the emulator, and it refused to authenticate root after that. So: I don't know the answer."

Some tweaking of XF86Config is, I imagine, also going to be necessary.\r\n\r\nWhat I do find very interesting is that Wine is built-in; SLS is the only distro I've encountered that includes Wine.\r\n\r\nI've changed root's password, but I haven't tried logging in after that, so I'll give that a whirl and see if I'm running into the same issue of root not authenticating."
