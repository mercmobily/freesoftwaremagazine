    body: "<strong>Comment from Terry Hancock [Member] Ã‚Â· http://www.anansispaceworks.com</strong>\r\n\r\n    2005-10-21 @ 21:30\r\n    The obvious way to achieve this would be to do what Apple did, and create a Unix rooted in Free BSD or another BSD-licensed variant. Then they could create a proprietary Unix.\r\n\r\n    Presumeably, they would then have to fuss over \"embracing and extending\" Posix, in order to continue their characteristic marketing strategies.\r\n\r\n    It would, of course, fail to compete effectively with Linux, because there's no way they could afford to pay for all the testers and debuggers to compete with the entire population of free software users.\r\n\r\n    But, just as MacOS X has done, it would make it easier for free software applications to run on the commercial platform. This would bring competition right on to the consumer desktop, though, which would be a really uncomfortable thing for MS for the same reason (head-to-head competition with free software development efforts ).\r\n\r\n    Microsoft's lead in the consumer desktop market consists entirely of market inertia: people continue to use Microsoft Windows because \"everyone else is using it\" and they want to be able to share with those people. Remaining incompatible with other standards is one way to strengthen that hold.\r\n\r\n    Of course, inertia can't last forever, and people are slowly leaking to the free software side, so that increasingly, \"everyone else is using it\" is an argument for standardized, free software solutions, instead of against (anything \"web-based\" being the leading edge)."
