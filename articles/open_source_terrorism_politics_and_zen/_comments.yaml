    body: "I think you're confusing \"terrorism\" with \"guerrilla warfare\". Those principles quoted from Eric Raymond are certainly apt when you consider the resourcefulness of the insurgents in Iraq, but those people are not terrorists, they are fighting a war. It's a multi-sided war, between different Iraqi factions and also against the US and its allies who invaded their country. But it's a war, nonetheless.\r\n\r\nTerrorists, on the other hand, don't fight wars. They're not interested in any of the goals of warfare, they're just out to terrorize people.\r\n\r\nLawrence D'Oliveiro"

    body: "The real terrorists are the people who terrorize for financial, power or egocentric motives, and at times rally others to a hopeless cause. Insurgents become terrorists when they refuse to negotiate on a fair-playing field, or refuse to listen to a logical counter-argument.\r\n\r\nAll others are just followers, and are just defending their own little causes, whatever it may be - i.e. autonomy of a region (Revolutionaries vs. England), fervent support of their religious beliefs (abortion-clinic bombers), or just avenging the needless death of their friends and family (Palestinian suicide bombers). But same rules apply as insurgents.\r\n\r\nAnd straying away from that topic, just like nuclear technology can be used for good and evil, so can open-source insurgency. I think we need to develop the field, perhaps write a few more books on techniques and such, you know, in preparation for when the machines attack. We're already getting all manners of autonomous military hardware taking over the roles of human personnel. We also have an administration that comes down heavily on dissenters, and wants to launch unilateral wars without the approval of the greater majority. How long before our elected officials and their automated military turn on us the citizens?\r\n\r\nIf anything, the NRA should be leading the field in this.\r\n\r\nJust my two cents."
