    body: 'Yah blenders interface is pretty horrible. THe lack of useful menu''s where they SHOULD be really gives me a rage boner. Not to mention theres no easy way to select or move anything. Unrealed still has the most dummy proof 3d designing interface but its scope is pretty much limited to crappy unreal type gaming. Maya and 3ds are pretty complex but at least you can find an UNDO without having to read through 30 pages of horrible manual.'

    body: 'Yep it is very confusing but I think it is this way to discourage people from becoming 3D artist and such.  I started trying out Blender but it was too frustrating so I walked away from it for a few months. I then came back to it and again I walked away. Now, I am going to really try to learn how to use Blender. So my point is, you can walk away and take a break and come back and tame the beast. Best of luck.'

    body: "You will learn blender from the video tutorial collection below.\r\n\r\nI remember when I figured out blender, creating a new object. And understanding how to G Grab objects and move them around.  then I got used to the different views and shifting the view port around.  Once you get used to arranging things and understanding why your objects disappear (go out of one view) then you have less to worry about. Blender interface gets slammed alot, but actually I find it to be pretty awesome.  It's hard to do this stuff, new vocabulary, complicated objects and movements.  After using the blender interface, adobe programs are starting to seem weak.  But getting better.  I love the panels that know you are inside them in blender.\r\n\r\nWhen I was first learning blender, the tutorials available pretty much sucked. I remember this castle tutorial and trying to figure out how to extrude.  \r\n \r\nI recommend these videos.  Go no where else until you have viewed about 10 of these.  Seriously, these tutorials rock the house. \r\n\r\nhttp://ocw.tufts.edu/Content/28/supplementarymaterial/366743\r\n\r\nYou'll need realplayer or real alternative to view them.  Img Quality = Good,  Training = Great "

Cannot wait now to make animation - but ok step by step in tutorial (now learning how to make materials) :)  But making landscapes was awsome :) (my two mountains - following tutorial were great - now making villages in it and people, animals - and adding materials). \r\n"
