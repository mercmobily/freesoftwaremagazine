    body: "Interesting but ...\r\n\r\nZonbu at a first glance appears to be a very close cousin if not an outright twin to a \"Thin client terminal\" device, rather than a computer. All your data is always stored at the Zonbu's remote servers, not in your computer which does not have a HDD for that purpose. Essentially you don't really buy a computer, you buy a service and a custom terminal device to access the service.\r\n\r\nThe total cost for two years of use is $99.00 + 24 x $12.95 = $410.00 + tax and shipping, all of it has to be purchased at once. \r\n\r\nDell has two Inspiron sub-$400.00 models and HDD where you can store your own stuff. Add any one of the free Linux distros to it for $0.00 and you have at least the same capabilities plus more speed and a real storage device. \r\n\r\nAll that fuzzy \"Green\" stuff is also somewhat misleading and means little to the planet per se: The non-green stuff runs at the Zonbu's site, the servers in full scale machine room, with large air conditioners and other equipment to keep your data safe, cool and available. So really, the couple of dollars that you might save in your electricity bills is just redirected to the Zenbu. \r\n\r\nBe sure to read the small print."

The file manager might be from XFCE (or homebuilt?), the panel and many icons are from KDE, and a lot of the software is from Gnome (and not lighteweight stuff either, Banshee and F-Spot are both C# apps running on Mono).  Seems like everything could be made much faster by sticking with one environment and the corresponding apps as much as possible.'

    body: "The hardware sounds nice, but not unique to Zonbu, as mentioned in comments above. Clearly, this is another \"give away the razor and sell the blades\" strategy -- one year of storage at the rates you quote is higher than the cost of the computer. One suspects subsidizing along the lines of game consoles (and that is a trap from the PoV of FS advocates). Not that I personally consider this unethical -- I just see the drawbacks from a consumer perspective. I'm sure that for some people it could be a good deal (just not me).\r\n\r\nHowever, I can certainly imagine wanting a remote-boot device like this, with <em>my own</em> server. This would be quite nice for a shop computer, for example, where the environment is variously hostile (T above 90 F (30 C) or below 30 F (0 C), grit, dust, oil, sawdust, metal chips, etc), or for an inexpensive home audio-recording studio where the solid-state silent operation would be a big plus.\r\n\r\nIn practice, though, there's always been enough \"semi-retired\" PCs around so I don't feel too justified buying a new one, even at $100 (reusing a 10-yr-old PC being nearly free, even more landfill-friendly -- the drawbacks being power-consumption, noise, and reliability).\r\n\r\nOne thing I would like to see is GNU/Linux distros with quick/easy \"X terminal\" or \"thin client\" or \"remote storage\" installation modes to make this sort of setup easier. By now, there are a number of named categories of FS-based computers (we might also add \"firewall\", \"router\", \"web server\", \"file server\", \"print server\", \"workstation\", \"laptop\", etc) for which there are fairly standard configuration choices.\r\n\r\nDebian has the \"task selector\", but IIRC, it doesn't really come very close to these sort of practical choices -- not as currently laid out.\r\n\r\nOr maybe this kind of specialization calls for hand-optimized niche Free O/S distributions?\r\n"
