It will take a second revolution for them to accommodate something different. Give them Windows Vista and they will learn it because they must, anything else and they will resist stoutly - fact of life.\r\nThe number of times I have dealt with people who use Linux always from a reference point of Windows is countless. Constantly I remind them that I don't know what or how Windows does it, but to understand Linux is not Windows or a clone of Windows and so there is no use talking to me about Windows.

    body: "I hate that. The cost of installing GNU/Linux is way less than that other OS because of the licensing and the cost of upgrading FOREVER is less because GNU/Linux is designed to be modular. There are fewer unintended consequences. These folks are mathematically challenged. Often GNU/Linux pays for itself in the first year and the rest is gravy. There is a much bigger advantage to Linux if you go to thin clients, too, than with that other OS. Then, you only have maintenance of a few servers. How can they not see the advantages? Oh, that's right. They are not looking. Competitors will overtake these dinosaurs. I hope we do not have to wait for natural causes.\r\n\r\nOn the other side, the list of companies providing Linux on desktops and laptops is growing rapidly. They must have customers who see the light.\r\n\r\nA problem is an opportunity."

So it can not be wasted (it is possible though that in the past, when it was spent, it was wasted). When one calculates costs and benefits has to consider only future cash-flows. \r\n\r\nSuch <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/ict/policy/doc/2006-11-20-flossimpact.pdf\">a study was prepared be the EU</a>, and showed that FOSS is cheaper, and IS a viable alternative."

    body: "Hello all. I work with Chris who submitted the open letter and we support him absolutely: I definitely think it is a backwards move on the part of the ICT hub to cut funding for FOSS. We have been using Foss in our own organisation for a while, and it has both saved us lots of money and been more efficient.\r\n\r\nHowever I slightly resent the implication in some of the comments above that failure to adopt Linux instantly is just because people are slow adaptors or 'hard of learning' (a charming and particularly helpful phrase): we certainly couldn't all just go over to Linux as we are tied in to certain programmes which are not compatible with Linux desktops (we have been trying to develop a FOSS version of one of those programmes but this doesn't happen overnight, and it doesn't necessarily happen without development funding). Failure to go over to FOSS isn't just about resistance, it is much more complicated.\r\n\r\nMight I also suggest that to use Linux from the reference point of Windows is both natural and certainly initially a perfectly sensible way to become used to it. Most people start off by using Windows, after all, whether we like it or not.\r\n\r\nI could say much, much more, but anyone who cares about how foss has worked in practice for our org. can read my blog at www.afl.org.uk/susieblog (which documents these very issues) :-). \r\n\r\nSusie"

End of.\r\nFOSS is being adopted in the UK VCS as Susie has pointed out, but there are others (not even ICT Hub related) that make MSoft very very attactive for non profits to aquire.\r\nI also resent the pitying and scornful tone of some of these comments which imply the VCS in the UK is some second rate sector being bullied by MSoft and the ICT Hub. This is simply not true, small charities just want a simple solution presented in a friendly way so they can get the job done.\r\nAs for that funding the money has not been cut from the ICT Hub its just going elsewhere into a programme that will draw out ICT Champions in each region who are able to address the wider issues the VCS have around ICT\r\nThanks\r\nWG"

    body: "There is a confusion in Chris's original article that is now being compounded by WG. We are actually talking about two different FOSS projects here, both funded separately under the UK government's ChangeUp programme. The first one referred to by Chris was the East of England FOSS in the VCS project given £30,000 pounds ($60,000). I coordinated that project and I maintain strongly that it completed what it agreed to do and gave good value for money.\r\n\r\nThe project WG is referring to when he says \"The FOSS project simply did not come up with the goods in the time it was given and with the resources it had. End of.\" refers to a second project contracted by the ICT Hub with the National Computing Centre (NCC) for £350,000 ($700,000). I would agree with him that it produced very little for this money.\r\n\r\nBut surely the clear implication of the NCC failing \"to come up with the goods\" within the agreed time scale and budget is that it did not fulfil its contract? Why is FOSS being blamed? Why isn't the ICT Hub asking for the return of some of its money from the NCC and reallocating it to others who could carry out what the NCC was contracted to do, rather than now virtually abandoning deployment of FOSS in the VCS? \r\n\r\nAs Chris says, the research in our East of England project did show the potential for FOSS in the sector and it also pointed to key issues that needed to be addressed if this potential was to be realised. NCC carried out no similar research, which would seem to be essential, before starting its project. \r\n\r\nChris Bailey\r\nAdvice for Life FOSS in the VCS project"

    body: "This debate is really important.\r\n\r\nA real effort was made in the final few months of the project to work with as many grassroots projects as possible. Indeed it has been said that the project 'turned around' after I was made manager.  It seemed as if a seedling community was growing, within the challenging climate which is the interface between FOSS, funding, funders, old school cathedrals, etc. \r\n\r\nI am gutted at the way the project ended and the current state of play, but have been strongly advised not to share business information (i.e. express my views) or talk to clients of NCC. I no longer have a laptop or access to the openitup server to work with at this time.\r\n\r\nIf there is any way that I can assist those that have been involved with FOSS in the VCS over the last few years gain recognition and reward then I will do so.  I feel that we need a strong community if we are to build on our work over and not lose out to bandwagon jumpers that happen to socialise with the people who control the funding.  Watch this space, we may (or may not) get funding! It doesn't matter too much anyway.  We have the expertise, the technology, the ethics and philosophy, the community and the passion.  All we have to do is not get caught up in scrabbling and squabbling between ourselves for the tit bits of funding that may or may not come down to us.  Thank you to those that supported my efforts.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The fact that the £350,000 given to the NCC (which I'm not sure I would exactly call a 'tit bit' of funding) didn't show results is *not the same thing as Foss itself not showing results*, and I think we need to be clear about that although I don't particularly want to get into the reasons why the results weren't there (because I don't know them, so I'm not going to presume to comment.)\r\n\r\nThe East of England Foss in the VCS project which Chris led on did certainly show results - it might have also showed there were challenges and things to be addressed (which is extremely useful information in itself, besides being realistic), but overall it was very positive, and I think some of the stuff Chris managed to develop while we were doing it will have long-term implications, certainly for AFL and possibly for the sector (and beyond?).\r\n\r\nSusie Halksworth\r\nAFL Resources Director."
