    body: "It's an interesting question. On the one hand, we like the idea of programmers getting paid by an interested party to add features that party wants. On the other hand, there's a strong feeling that free software communities work better when they aren't 'distracted' by mercenary concerns.\r\n\r\nJBoss is a company though (AFAIK -- I don't keep up with Java), so there's probably already a degree of commercial organization and leadership.\r\n"
