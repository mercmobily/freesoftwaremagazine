In the past, Free Software Magazine's readers and the FSDaily community have 
needed to create accounts and login in order to post comments, post to forums 
forums, vote on stories and polls, and generally get involved in the 
community of the sites. Thanks to OpenID, this has now changed: we have now 
enabled and tested OpenID on the server, and we can proudly say that it works 
fantastically well.
 
If you are already a subscriber, you can still retain your login name and 
login using OpenID [here for Free Software Magazine](http://www.freesoftwaremagazine.com/user) and [here for Free Software Daily](http://www.fsdaily.com/user) (keep in mind that you need to be logged in for 
this link to work). Then click on the "OpenID Identities" tab and adding your 
OpenID to the field labelled "Add an OpenID".
 
If you are not a subscriber, you can login and vote for stories using OpenID 
by clicking on "Log in using OpenID". As simple as that!

If you have any trouble, please let us know: email us at "helpdesk" followed 
by "@freesoftwaremagazine.com" for Free Software Magazine, or "staff" 
followed by "@fsdaily.com" for FSDaily.
 
More web sites ought to allow OpenID authentication - it encourages a sense of 
community and contribution within the web. We feel that Free Software 
Magazine and FSDaily have made a step in the right direction. The fact that 
Drupal 6 "comes" with OpenID can only brighten the future of this great much 
needed standard.
