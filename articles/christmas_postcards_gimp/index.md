While I am still waiting for the information I need aboutthe legal issues of making MP3s out of your CDs,I didn't want to sit here in silence and eat all the[pandoro](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandoro) I can get.So I'd like to help you create your own Christmas/New Year's card with[the GIMP](http://www.gimp.org/)

First of all, get a suitable image to work on. I had one handy: mychild in his bath with a foam beard that made him look so similar to Santa Claus.


=IMAGE=blog-scale-image.jpg=Scaling your postcard=

If you took it with your digital camera it wouldbe probably too big and heavy to comfortably fit into an email message,so the first thing to do is to scale it. I recommend to keep the widerside at 600 pixels, but 400 would be definitely better.


=IMAGE=blog-text-tool.jpg=GIMP's toolbox=

After that, select the text tool button in the GIMP's toolbox; finda nice typeface, a pretty color and an appropriate size, click on theimage and write the text. If you don't like anything in the textattributes (say: the typeface) you can change it and have the textautomatically reflect the change.


=IMAGE=natale2006.jpg=Merry Christmas and happy new year!=

That's all! There's nothing else to do, and nothing else to say. May this newupcoming year be the best one you ever lived!

Best Wishes
