    body: "Neoware's are excellent in a Windows Terminal Services or Citrix environment.  However, they're pretty much useless for anything else.  If you order them, get the models with WinCE, not XPembedded.

Educational discounts may make this point completely irrelevant.\r\n\r\nThere are a large array of Linux based thin-clients, see the following article from Linux devices\r\n\r\nhttp://www.linuxdevices.com/articles/AT4923746399.html"
