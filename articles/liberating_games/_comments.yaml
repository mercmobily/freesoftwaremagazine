A number of Linux distros come with UAE, so I don't think it qualifies as proprietary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI still have several working Amigas and they play well with my Linux NFS file server.\r\n\r\n<hr/>\r\n\r\n"

    body: "I dont believe comparing games to disney films is fair. There just hasnt been the increase in technology for filming, whereas gaming has come a long long way. Many people are only interested in relatively new games, and simply wouldnt bother buying an old game. But films would carry the same magic for aalot longer, so they CAN wait for a long time. It's also been around for a bit longer, dont you think?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSorry if my spelling's bad.\r\n\r\nFrom a hopeful person"
