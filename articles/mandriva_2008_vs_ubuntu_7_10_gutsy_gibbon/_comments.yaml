    subject: 'Correcting some facts about Mandriva 2008.0'
    hostname: 81.57.82.36
    created: '1194687709'
    body: "First, thanks you for this interesting review. We'll look at some of the point you raised for next Mandriva release.\r\n\r\nHowever, I'd like to correct some errors in your article about Mandriva 2008.0 and ask some questions :\r\n-it might have been more interesting to compare Ubuntu LiveCD installer with Mandriva One Live-install and Ubuntu installer with Mandriva \"standard\" installer (called DrakX). There is even a Mandriva One 2008.0 GNOME release to make sure comparison is fair, specially when you are stating Mandriva is not completely ready after installation. \r\n-draksound should be able to help you reconfigure your sound card. But I'm not sure it will kill programs still using sound card when you want to switch sound drivers.\r\n-the rpm database corruption is still under investigation but it appears to be only for people who did a 2007.0 initial installation and then upgrade to 2007.1 and to 2008.0 (or directly to 2008.0). Fortunately, we have been able to duplicate it in our office yesterday (friday), after more than one month trying to find what was causing it and why we could duplicate it (and fixing a bug you can't duplicate can be very hard). More information is available at \r\nhttp://qa.mandriva.com/show_bug.cgi?id=32547\r\n-GNOME control center interface (often called shell) is not \"removed\" from Mdv 2008.0, we just have hidden it from default menu (just like Fedora or upstream GNOME), because we felt it would confuse user to have both Mandriva Control Center (for system \"administration\") and a separate desktop control center.\r\n-about NTFS/NTFS-3g, it should have been automatically configured by default for NTFS partitions detected at install time. Was it not the case ? Or did you plugged a NTFS drive after installation ? (We know there was a bug for Mandriva One ISO images which are lacking ntfs-3g, it will be fixed for 2008.1).\r\n-about Wifi, net-applet is automatically installed and configured by default and it handles Wifi network transparently (and it includes now a Network Center with a quick summary and fast way to change wifi network). You didn't got the \"automatically working\" wifi when you plugged your USB wifi key because you used installation which only install software relevant to your current hardware at install time. If you had installed a Mandriva One image, you would have had wifi firmware pre-installed by default (since they must been supported at boot time). It is a trade-off between installation vs liveCD. You obviously wouldn't like ton of useless packages installed by default on your system for hardware you don't have. But I agree net-applet should try to warn you it detected a new hardware and ask you if you want to configure it.\r\n-what was the problem with configuring ftp repository ?\r\n-stating that Ubuntu has an edge because Mandriva is shipping KDE by default is a little too extreme, IMHO. It might have been true 7 years ago, for Mdk 7.2, but since then, situation has evolved a lot. We are committed to support BOTH desktop environments (which is why we make sure to include features in both environments when it is relevant), which is why you are asked at install time which environment you want to install. Not modifying GNOME a lot, compared to upstream, is a design choice : we prefer to stick to GNOME upstream as much as possible and modify it only when it is relevant.\r\n-I agree sensors are not configured by default by installer. I'll forward this request, but I'm not sure it will be done (not everybody is monitoring their system sensors ;)\r\n-Mandriva fallback for X not working is not using a fallback X server because sometime, even a VESA server would not work (try on old i810 systems ;). Using ncursing might not be pretty, compared to Ubuntu solution, but we know it will always work. Moreover, this feature is available for 4 or 5 years in Mandriva / Mandrake distributions..\r\n-Changing X driver can be done while X is running, you don't have to fallback to text mode first.\r\n-Liberation fonts are NOT used all over the place for the desktop. They are only used as Microsoft fonts substitute for web pages under Firefox / Konqueror. All desktop applications are still using DejaVu font by default ! What you probably noticed is font rendering improvement, thanks to hard work of freetype team.\r\n\r\n"

After defecting from Xandros a few months ago I considered both Mandriva and Ubuntu but the latest Gutsy release has one feature that gives it the edge - the ability to encrypt the partition or drive and  which seems little publicized but which I found here http://users.piuha.net/martti/comp/ubuntu/en/cryptolvm.htm.

Personally I can't say that synaptic is really that faster and to be honest I don't find smart that much smarter than rpmdrake, btw. synaptic is available for Mandriva, just look in the contrib repositories."

    hostname: 216.231.62.127

    body: "Hi, \r\n\r\nNice article. I used Mandrake/Mandriva on my primary systems for years, and eventually switched over to Ubuntu with 6.06. What eventually made me switch was just that Ubuntu had a bit more support for 3rd-party software, as a Debian derivative. I found that while Mandriva was quite good, it had its own ideas of where to put different libraries, which meant tracking down the right switches to feed configure scripts, and all sorts of other things, when there's already a .deb available.\r\n\r\nAnyway, the main thing I wanted to point out is that Ubuntu has not let the command line environment slide in any way at all. It's just different. It is rooted in the \"Debian way\" of doing things, rather than having Red Hat roots. Yes, it's unfamiliar at first, and yes, some of the tools are different or missing, but it's no less powerful. Reconfiguring X can be done with dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg. You can get a root account by simply using sudo passwd, and setting a root password. Yes, Ubuntu installs a minimal shell environment by default, but all the power tools are an apt-get away. And if you try to run a shell program that isn't there, most of the time it'll tell you what package to install to get it! The shell is hardly a second class interface in Ubuntu.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what manual overrides in shell files aren't working for you, or what required a reboot--about the only time I have to reboot is related to incompatible hardware drivers. The config files all take changes the same way, but often the actual files you change are different in Debian systems.\r\n\r\nIn all, I do like the way Mandriva sets up the shell environment by default--aliases for ls -l, lots of tools and automatic system checks. I just thought I'd point out that Ubuntu is no slouch. We've even been using it on servers--we have probably a dozen running various versions of Ubuntu, none of them with X. Certain things make them much nicer to administer for our needs--a2ensite for quickly enabling/disabling Apache virtual hosts, for example.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nJohn"

I too use both Mandriva 2008 and Ubuntu 7.10, and whilst both have their advantages and disadvantages one of the things that Mandriva has that Ubuntu doesn't have is the ability to customise the software you install. For example I prefer using Epiphany rather then Firefox as my web browser. Mandriva gives me the ability to deselect  Firefox from the installation and to select Epiphany in it's place. Ubuntu on the other hand pre-installs Firefox whether you want it to or not. \r\n\r\nHowever this is just a minor thing and any software you want which is not included in the default installation of Ubuntu can be easily added afterwards :). One of the joys of Linux is the freedom of choice it gives the end user, and with such great distro's such as Ubuntu and Mandriva those choices can be hard to make at times. Anyway enough rambling from me, thanks once again for such a great article :)"

The only real suggestion I got on the forums?  To mute the mic.  What sort of nonsense is that? I need to be able to video chat with my son on the other side of the US, and that requires a functioning sound card with nothing disabled nor muted.
