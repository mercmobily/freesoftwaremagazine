    body: "How could we not be giving gifts at Christmas?\r\n\r\nVery simple (and it applies, partly of completely, to most or all of the similar events).\r\n\r\nThink about where and in what conditions, most of the \"gifts\" you buy, were built (on this matter, free software, just like any kind of software, is indeed very similar to christmas, if we think about hardware and electronic components in general). Even if you are building something yourself, think about the source of what you are using.\r\n\r\nThink about the mount of money, circulating during this period (and all year, for that matter).\r\n\r\nThink about the pollution, both to build your \"gifts\" (and again, even if you build something yourself -and if you went to a beautiful forest, to gather stuffs, think about how many insects and small creatures you killed or heavily injured, and, again, what is the source of what you are taking), and to trash/recycle your \"gifts\" (and during use, if the material is not very stable, or if you need batteries). Particularly think about oil spill (plastic), and how they are destructing nature, to build dams, for aluminium industries, in one of the most preserved area of Earth, in Iceland.\r\n\r\nThink about the number of animals and vegetals (and people), who died and were killed, so you can enjoy a good meal, in a warm house.\r\n\r\nThink about how dedicating a day, or a period, to it, generally means that the rest of the year, you can care less, if at all. Just how hypocrite is that.\r\n\r\nThink about the current state of today society, and how this kind of things are simply here for temporary \"relief\", so you will be able to go on the very same path of self-destruction, and of global destruction, the day after, avoiding to \"explode\", and thinking too much about another way of life (you know, an utopia, \"a simplistic view on humanity and life, which do well in fantasy books, but which will never work in the real world, because we all know that humans are frigging evil, and because it would require far too much work\" -you know, like there was no reasons for humanity current evilness, and like we were not wasting a hundred times the energy to build an idealistic society, ever year, while still having time for everything else).\r\n\r\nThink about how many laws are passed, just before holidays (not just year-end ones), when their is not even 5% of the people who should be there (well, not that them being their, does change much anything to the final result -it's not as if any good and well-thought law was passed, the rest of the year).\r\n\r\nThink about how you are force-fed, as a kid, with all these stories, and how, when you grow up, you are told that it does not exist, and you would be stupid to believe in these \"fairy tales\"... though there is absolutely no certainty in both of these beliefs. This is part of the beginning of a life of mental and physical slavery, in today society. If you cannot say, seriously, that \"Santa Claus might exist, just as anything else\", then you are just the common slave around here.\r\n\r\nThink about the number of suicides, during the year-end period. Think about all these people, who long for a better life, and who can't think about anything else but the stupid and destructive way of life, of \"the others\". Christmas, school, parents, money, food.\r\n\r\nThink about the number of people who have strictly no care, maybe because of one or all of the above reasons, and who have to put up with all this sick masquerade. Who have to put up with the increase of noise from family, neighbours and most other people, be it at home, or in the streets. Who have to put up with people \"criticizing\" their views, in the most stupid ways, like \"you have no heart\", \"you are boring\", \"you are sad\" (yeah, right :P), without even thinking about what they are saying... you know, this kind of things go as a pack: \"how to be stupid, *and* how to reply to people telling you, you are stupid\".\r\n\r\nThink about the one hour and a half, I have spent to tell you all this, instead of working.\r\n\r\n\r\nOh, but that ok, you know. I'm a \"moaner\", you don't have to care. If you had to care about every people who give a simple, clear and reasoned view on a subject, which strictly contradicts \"your\" vision of it (I say \"your\", as a huge simplification, because we all know you never really thought about it: it's just how you were told it should be), what kind of boring reasonable and philosophical man would you be... I mean, you don't want this, right?\r\n"

    body: 'I do admit I wasn''t as overt in the irony as I could have been and I was attempting to be "light". I don''t disagree with you and you make good points. Another point to keep in mind is that the Open source structure is agnostic and is used in any number of ways which was more to my point. After all, Al Queda is structured on an Open Source model and they are fairly successful with their endeavor too. Yes, we all need to wake up and understand the dependent origination of all things, the pressure of the egocentric marketing machine and our responsibilities to each other and the planet.'

    body: "No problem. It's just that openess (open source) and freedom (free software) does not have much to do with Christmas... I understand your point, and it's always good to find \"traces of similitude\" between open source/free software, and matters more common to the general public, but it really should have been more neutral... (by not omitting details about the very nature of Christmas, notably -well, at least of Christmas in the current society, though some points apply to the \"original\" Christmas just as well, and others could be made).\r\n\r\nI think the best subject (if we had to choose between what is available...), to use, when talking to the general public, about open source and free software, is works in the \"public domain\". It's still very limited, and what most people mean by open source and free software, is not that close to what we mean by \"public domain\", but the notions are still similar, and the general public knows about the benefits of the public domain (though you might have to make them remember, by talking about well-known books, paintings, musics, plays, games, etc., and how they can be used -somewhat- freely today, because they tend to easily forget what it means, in the current society).\r\n\r\nYou could also have avoided naming brands...\r\n\r\n\r\nWell, no big deal, anyway, this is simply common.\r\n"
