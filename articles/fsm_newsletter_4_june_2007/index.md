Hello readers, and welcome once again to Free Software Magazine’s fortnightly newsletter, keeping you up to date with all things free software! Enjoy!


# General announcements

It is one big fortnight, ladies and gentlemen.

We have just released a great selection of extra features for all our users! These are:


* Ads-free web site
* Access to a printer friendly version of each article and blog entry
* Access to an automatic generated PDF version of each article and of each issue.
* Ability to have your own blog in Free Software Magazine.
* And other minor features too like the ability to have clickable links in comments.

How can I get all these amazing things, I hear you ask? Well, thanks to the efforts of our dedicated team, we now have a karma points system! When you post comments on our articles others have the opportunity to rate your comments. Each rating gives or takes away karma from your total. The more karma you accumulate, the more cool features will become available! 
**[Update 2008-03-06: All the extra features are now available to all logged in users]**

# Poll Results—Trivia poll: How many Microsoft patents are broken by free programs?

Okay, so the clear winner of our tongue-in-cheek trivia poll was resoundingly “Zero”, with 57% of the votes. This was followed by it’s polar opposite, “All of them!” with 25% of the vote... come on guys, you’re just being silly! This was followed by 13% with a thoughtful “One million, three hundred and thirty six thousand, seven hundred and seven (give or take)”, 4% with the figure of “Two hundred and thirty five”... but for some strange reason, nobody liked the number “Five thousand, three hundred and fifty seven” at all! All these numbers not withstanding, all of those who commented made it clear that they thought Microsoft’s attack on free software is just ridiculous.
