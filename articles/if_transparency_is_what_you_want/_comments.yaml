Instead he wrote an article that said PDF was a thing of the past and it was being abandoned because no one wanted it.  The reaction shows clearly how wrong that was - especially because no printer-friendly format was available.  Being up front about your business model and why you make the decisions you make will always win you many more friends and supporters than any other approach.'

I've even bought a couple of books because it was featured on this site.\r\n\r\nWhat surprised me what the reactions of many that objected to the cease of the Free Software Magazine PDF. I didn't understand why people would react in such a way for quality content that they received at no cost to them. Some of those people sounded like real spoiled brats. As for me, I thank you for your work. I commend your dedication to running a site such as this and I wish you the best of luck for the future."

    body: "The numerical analysis doesn't make much sense. This was not the result of a vote, but a response from people who were upset enough to reply. Most people simply didn't comment. AFAICT, no one supported the lack of PDFs. Actually, I knew it was coming, and I knew you wouldn't be flexible on the subject, so there was no point in complaining.\r\n\r\nISTM, it's safe to say that the decision was rather unpopular.\r\n\r\nOf course, that's different from asking \"are PDFs worth the trouble for FSM?\" -- because that depends on how much trouble they are. From what you've said, I gather they were a real pain.\r\n\r\nWhich is a shame, because I had thought it was pretty automated, and I think the PDFs were very nice to have for genuine articles. HTML is fine for online browsing, but I normally store papers I want to refer to later in PDF if I can, simply because it's a very self-contained format (That said, some form of XML with embedded resources would be smarter in the long run. I suppose ODF fits that description -- but I gathered that wasn't too easy either).\r\n\r\nFSM is never going to find a business model, though, if it doesn't accept that making money is a rational and ethical thing to do. I can't understand your negativism about carrying advertisements, and if RMS really pulled the link over that issue, then he is much more anti-commercial than he likes to admit. Ads are a distraction, but they make it possible to offer paid work for free.\r\n\r\nIMHO, you've done something very commendable just avoiding the MS \"Get the FUD\" ads. Ad space is supposed to be a fair market for people who pay, not a way to editorialize. That's why it's so important to clearly mark the difference between advertiser-paid \"content\" and the real stuff from your writers and editors.\r\n\r\nSo, IMHO, you shouldn't be beating yourself up over needing the ads. Of course, people are going to complain -- but these are the same people who refused to pay for subscriptions. They just want something for nothing. There will always be people like that, and you have to learn to ignore them.\r\n\r\nThe alternatives are:\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>turn to paid subscriptions (your subscriber list will plummet, of course)</li>\r\n<li>officially declare yourself a non-profit and seek foundation grant funding</li>\r\n<li>pass the hat (and you'd better reform as a non-profit for that, too)</li>\r\n<li>give up on paying authors, and just accept the roll as yet another blog site</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nOf course, \"passing the hat\" can be quite sophisticated. There's RSPP and there's \"pledge drives\" like the \"Public Broadcasting System\" does here in the US.\r\n\r\nI distrust the foundation funding concept, because basically that's just passing the buck (so then, how do <em>they</em> make the money?).\r\n\r\nIt's possible that a subscription model would work, but it would reduce the reach of the publication (only the free articles would continue to have that reach). But there's something in that -- if people are only willing to take what you're providing if you're providing it for free, then maybe they don't really value it as much as you've been hoping they would.\r\n\r\nThe default path, of course, is just to keep doing things the way we are doing it -- and that means none of the writers are really getting paid. So it's basically just another blog site (the distinction between \"blog\" and \"article\" is being reduced, since they both are essentially treated the same when the magazine is 100% online and no one's getting paid to write anyway). Perhaps a slightly more professional one -- but it's not entirely clear that that will persist.\r\n\r\nStill, it's pretty neat even that you were able to swing the \"payment in books\" arrangement.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, though, it seems like ads are your best bet, and I'm only sad that they aren't selling better. OTOH, there is another point, which is that advertising sales isn't linear: the more ads you have, the less valuable each ad is. Some of the most lucrative ad sites are the ones with very few ads, because the remaining ads are very prominent.\r\n\r\nBut you need an expert to sell ad space in an optimal way (and I am not that person!)\r\n"

    body: "I agree that adverts seem to be the best source of revenue. I'm generally more interested in the blog than the magazine, because it has so many entries added all the time, which are often very interesting. Which link has RMS supposedly pulled? I see this site has still got quite a prominent place on the 'Free Software Links' page of the GNU site. I'd be surprised if the FSF would have anything against adverts on this page. From what I've read, the reason they don't have them on their own pages is in case any appeared on them for proprietary software, which they don't want to support in any way. I wouldn't have thought they'd be too bothered if the adverts on this site are for proprietary software, though I suppose they might then see endorsing this site as supporting proprietary software in an indirect way. Either way, it's not just because adverts are 'commercial'. It's all about 'free as in speech' rather than 'free as in beer' after all, and they often praise people who develop free software for commercial reasons.\r\n \r\n--\r\nGNU - free as in freedom"

We've also had a bunch of people (not many really - maybe 50) coming forward and saying they are fine with the PDF being gone. But you can't just compare these figures. This would be comparing the black and the white but leaving out the massive amount of gray. The vast majority are in the middle and either a) don't care enough to complain or b) don't care at all. In fact, I would say most of them don't care at all. If you've still got what you want (the content) and you don't care that it's only in HTML, why would you feel the need to say anything?   \r\n\r\nAs I said before, our position is further reinforced by the fact that there has been a decline in the number of downloads per issue in the last year and that says a lot. Moreover, the number of downloads per issue is far less than the number of subscribers. So there's a lot of people out there who subscribe but never download an issue. And that number has been growing with each issue. More people are subscribing but less and less are downloading the PDF... what does that tell you? The content is popular but the PDF isn't (as popular).\r\n\r\nAll this aside we are working on alternatives and hopefully we can make a greater percentage of our readers happy soon."
