It is more than a little frustrating. The idea of dictating terms rather than being dictating them to these companies is going to be a rough ride but unless people band together, then nothing can be achieved. '

The community?  Ok, but how many of them are going to want some standardized machine?  It would cost several million dollars (maybe more) to fulfill the needs of the open source community and three months after it's built something new will come out and people will stray.  The reason Linux is so successful is for the compatibility of x86 architecture, once this becomes proprietary then the allure is gone.  Granted, Linux will still be available for x86 and probably won't loose support, but I am curious how many die-hards will support the development process for a limited system (hardware).  \r\n\r\nI understand the idea of stripping OS costs, but if someone is that concerned about it all they have to do is 1. build the machine themselves (takes a couple of hours) or 2. go to a retailer that builds them for you.  In either case you can obtain a computer without an OS.  \r\n\r\nIs this an idea to place one of these \"Open Architecture\" computers in every Be$t Buy, Circuit City, Wal-Mart, and whatever other evil empire you can think of?

That one cost almost US$5000, the Arduino costs US$30.  You can build one yourself for less than US$10.

First off, how to create a manufacturing and supply chain for free hardware.  That's already working, you can buy the Arduino readily in North America and Europe.  More work is being done along these lines in Colombia, South Korea, and other places.\r\n\r\nAlso, just like free software is architected and built in a very different manor than proprietary software from giant companies, free hardware is developed in a very different manor than hardware designed and built by giant companies.

Corporations using Linux don''t want to worry about hardware issues.  Then we, when we build our systems, know which components to pick from and not worry about hardware compatibility issues.  But just like the author said, unity is what is needed.  There has to be a central list of hardware components that go on a website and are GUARENTEED by manufacturers to be open and by the kernel Linux developers to work without compatibiliy issues.  You''ll see a ton of people go to that website and depend on it when building a system.'

You say that \"we\" should work together to build this, and I agree, but that is where the problem starts.  Apple can do it because they are a company united towards a common goal.  They have people who argue back and forth about certain pieces of hardware, just like us, but they also have someone who can step in and say \"just pick one already\", whereas we don't.  Should we use this part, or that part?  Without someone to moderate, the argument could go on forever.  For examples, look at all the forks we have now, because two people (or groups) wanted to do something two different ways...\r\n\r\nNow, I know I sounded kinda down there, but I really DO see it as a positive; the more different ways to do something, the better.

Now, sure, they can be wrong sometimes (and sometimes they are) but they're also measuring \"right\" and \"wrong\" by measuring the market. By and large, open source software measures \"right\" and \"wrong\" according to the religious beliefs of whichever group of developers happens to be in power, and it's usually to serve their bleeding-edge geek preferences.\r\n\r\nThe working group would probably spin their wheels for months simply debating the license under which to release the specification.\r\n\r\nNow, if you took the Dave Winer/RSS approach, and had one or two smart people come up with the spec, take limited feedback, give the spec away out of the goodness of your heart and then evangelize the hell out of it, you might have something.

Linux has gone a long way to ameliorating the shortcomings of the design, but can only do so much.\r\n\r\nSince Linux is at its 15 year cusp, where acceptance is increasing exponentially, box sellers may be better off focusing their efforts on hardware that has been designed with Linux or UNIX in mind. This would give the add on manufacturers a defined market for non Windows hardware, making the possibility of open drivers a more achievable objective.\r\n\r\nIt would also fit in with people's desire to have the next best thing, and for them to see Windows as old hat. Something we in the know have been saying for years.\r\n\r\nI suggest we focus on lobbying IBM to build us an inexpensive Cell architecture laptop, use the existing PS3 as our desktop, and Cell blades as our server of choice.\r\n\r\nThis strategy will give us all a far better computing platform than the outdated IBM PC, and rapidly allow us to move to a much higher level of computing where 3D, natural Language, and handwriting recognition and response, are sustainable goals.\r\n\r\nKind regards\r\nStomfi, Australia"

Get a firm commitment that no component substituitions will happen without going back and ensuring compatibility.\r\n\r\nBuy some ads and sell some boxes.\r\n\r\nProfit.  Hopefully.\r\n\r\nIt doesn't have to be some \"Open Design\" debated for years by 'the community' who wouldn't be able to pony up the money to have a run made anyway, it needs an investor to see a market and sell a product into it.\r\n\r\nAny of the established design/marketing houses could do the exact same thing, but of course they won't for fear of Microsoft.  It means there is a market (small but probably large enough to support a lean outfit) that none of the established competitors can enter just waiting for someone to tap it.\r\n\r\nOutfits like Emperor do what they can with the stuff others make but they tend to end up loaded with proprietary crap that makes them brittle when upgrading or switching to a different distro.  Only a machine designed from the start to support Linux is going to do it trouble free.

    body: "The very reason for this culture of closed hardware is Microsoft uses this to pressurise OEMs to deny entry to competing products.\r\n\r\nCase in point - IBM OS/2. Why did it fail? Exactly 2 reasons:\r\n1. Drivers for hardware were hard to come by. You had to wait for IBM to write drivers because no vendor supplied native OS/2 drivers with their hardware. Why did this happen? Because Microsoft pressurised all hardware vendors to not build OS/2 drivers at the cost of losing the ability to write Windows 95 drivers.\r\n2. The IBM PC division suffered great losses in time to market because Microsoft refused to provide comparatively priced OEM copies of Windows 95. The impasse caused IBM to pay Microsoft huge fines and, despite this, receive OEM copies way after all other OEMs were shipping with Windows 95. Net result: IBM had to take huge losses.\r\n\r\nThe Free Software community should expect exactly this to happen. It is one way to raise the barrier to adoption and ensure that Microsoft Windows is what the typical OEM preinstalls on all shipped PCs.\r\n\r\nThere will be hardware that is designed around open specifications and standards of course. Network cards, USB mass storage devices etc. will remain supported because of they are built to open specifications and standards. However, there will also be hardware for which no standards exist. Support for these will always have to be reverse-engineered.\r\n\r\nThere are no easy ways around this. The Free Software community will have to continue reverse-engineering hardware after-the-fact and introduce support considerably later than Microsoft supports such hardware.\r\n\r\nThe OLPC is a huge move towards making a free computer a reality. The OLPC is also one platform that is, and will hopefully remain, free from Microsoft monopoly. Expect Microsoft to attack every country and educational organisation who adopts this. Expect Microsoft to throw all kinds of hurdles in the way of OLPC to slow/deter adoption. Even at this very moment Microsoft is working hard to get Windows to work on the OLPC.\r\n\r\nBecause what the OLPC means is a new generation of individuals no longer constrained by the Microsoft monopoly. These individuals will have grown up on Free Software, open standards and will have no Microsoft legacy to overcome. The OLPC is the ultimate weapon with the Free Software community.\r\n\r\nSupport OLPC with all you've got.\r\n\r\nSimply because our status-quo today has been cleverly engineered by a monopoly."

The biggest impediment in the case of laptops (and even desktops) is that they won't give out information or drivers to us.  Broadcom's a BIG offender in this realm, citing FCC requirements because of the software controlled radio modem.  This, is BOGUS, considering that we've got all kinds of open source drivers for Atheros, Ralink, and ZyDas WiFi chipsets- and they have the same concerns and they're open sourced.

    body: "There is a common myth that \"hardware can't be free because it's not zero-cost to replicate\", but the truth is that this confuses two issues which can be separated: the engineering design process (which certainly can be free, since <em>designs</em> are software) and the manufacturing process, which does indeed have costs, but they are much lower than the monopoly-based pricing of non-free designs.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the processes that manufacture consumer electronic components are essentially printing processes: lithography and etching (for both chips and PCBs), and assembly is highly automated with pick-and-place robots and oven-based soldering (for surface mount components). In fact, much of the cost savings associated with SMT manufacturing is precisely that it is easier to do with automated equipment (than \"through-hole\" PCB assembly).\r\n\r\nThe critical question for free-hardware manufacturers to ask is simply this: how much does it cost to tool-up for a run of parts? This translates to the impact on your margin for short runs, as you will expect with a product which initially reaches only a small market. Or in other words, it tells you how much of a premium you're going to have to charge customers for the short run; or how many customers you need to have lined up in order to make a run profitable at a given price.\r\n\r\nThis is a <em>very</em> different question from what it costs to <em>engineer</em> a new product, and that cost is substantially reduced (possibly to zero) by commons-based peer production, facillitated by free-licensing the design.\r\n\r\nThe impact of hardware replication cost on <em>engineering</em> comes down to this question: \"what will I have to spend on the manufacturing costs of engineering prototypes in order to test my design?\" For well-understood technologies such as computer equipment, where the principle concern is the complexity of the design, rather than fundamental unknowns in the technology, the answer is \"not much\", because good simulators exist which can be relied on to thoroughly predict the behavior of important categories of equipment.\r\n\r\nIt's more of a problem for emerging technologies and \"big hardware\". E.g. it will be a considerable problem for a new airplane or spacecraft design, because you're going to have to actually build and fly prototypes that may cost anywhere from $100,000 to $100,000,000 to build.\r\n\r\nBut for computers? It's not so bad. For the Open Graphics project, the group has decided to build a series of boards with FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Arrays -- this is sort of like a flash memory that encodes a working logic circuit instead of data) chips on them, that they can use to implement their gate-array design for the graphics processor. They are getting a short run of these made, and the individual cost will be approximately $1000.\r\n\r\nOnce this stage is complete, they expect to do a much larger run of ASIC (Application Specific Integrated Circuit -- a fixed logic circuit that can be easily customized for short run replication, but can't be re-programmed after manufacture. It's possible and common to have an ASIC implement a circuit prototyped in an FPGA) chips, and manufacture boards for consumer sales. These will be much more competitively priced (in principle, they could be cheaper than proprietary competitors, though in practice the premium due to manufacturing in short-runs will probably drive the cost higher).\r\n\r\nThere's no reason to believe that the situation will be very different for any other subsystem you commonly find in computers. Everything from motherboards to hard drives is subject to pretty much the same kinds of manufacturing considerations.\r\n\r\nAs with software, you will find a number of motivations for people to be involved in the engineering process of these product designs. One factor is customer-participation (\"I need it, therefore I will help design it\") or \"scratching an itch\". Another is the potential to make money from the manufactured components (even with free design, manufacturers involved in the engineering process will have a market advantage). Yet another comes from talented people who want to demonstrate their skill or who feel a desire to see the technology liberated.\r\n\r\nOnce the design is available, though, manufacturing is a no-brainer. It's obviously cheaper to manufacture an existing design, especially if there are no licensing fees, and so the short-run issue is really your only problem. As the manufacturing technology becomes more flexible, it becomes increasingly profitable and as the tooling costs drop, there will be more potential manufacturers. So, at some point, it's inevitable that we'll see open hardware based on free-licensed designs marketed and sold.\r\n\r\n"

This may be important in breaking through some of the obstacles that exist in innovating newer, greener, more efficient cars.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, due to regulatory considerations and the corporate politics of existing auto manufacturers, there is extremely little innovation going on in automotive design, despite the fact that our present technology is far behind where we need to be to encourage more sustainable development.\r\n\r\nIn some parts of the world, people can simply forgo cars, but I live in a part of the USA where that's just not realistic. Some kind of independent transportation is essential, and I think the answer isn't ‘no cars’, but rather ‘better cars’ (meaning safer, more fuel efficient, and non-polluting). I also think it's technically possible, but it's unlikely to happen in the next 50 years if mass-market auto manufacturers are the only ones supporting innovation.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I'm digressing a bit. The point is that, unlike spaceships or airplanes, prototype cars are generally cheap enough to build that upper-middle class individuals or small groups of lower-middle class individuals (e.g. students or club members) could build them. There are plenty of racing teams in Texas (where I live) that have all the necessary skills, equipment, and materials to do it.\r\n\r\nYou just need to find one interested in open hardware.\r\n\r\n[EDIT: I should just add that I do not mean zero-cost cars. Free cars will probably cost a bit more than proprietary ones for quite some time, even once they become available. The cost to build issue is relevant to engineering a free design, because you must build prototypes]\r\n"
