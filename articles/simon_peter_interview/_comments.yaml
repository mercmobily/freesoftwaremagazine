    body: "An answer to FAQ on Klik (http://klik.atekon.de/wiki/index.php/User's_FAQ) says it is not intended to become a package management system. However, it is exactly what I think is missing in the whole game. Imagine having just one software package for a broad class of operating systems, with a simple installation and no risk that something will break.\r\n\r\nMartin Jasny"
