    body: "I do active evangelism for Free software. However, I don't \"shove my belief down their throats\". I <em>only evangelise when</em> my friends and peers enquire about my policy of \"only Free Software\". My policy is:<ol> <li>I do not and will not use Non-Free software on any of my own systems </li> <li>I will not provide support in their usage of any Non-Free software.</li>\r\n<li>I will not recommend to anyone the usage of any piece of Non-Free software.</li></ol>\r\nI make an exception to my policy when someone is involved in reimplementing Non-Free software as Free software. I mention this exception only when it is relevant to the situation.\r\n\r\nI tell them that I only use and support the usage of <a href=\"http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html\">Free (aka. libre) software</a>. Then I explain that the issue isn't about price but of freedom and then explain the the philosophy of Free software. Then I explain dangers of Non-Free software as well my experiences of being harmed by User-Subjugating Non-Free software. Finally, if they enquired about $NON-FREE-SOFWARE, I explain that $NON-FREE-SOFTWARE restricts my freedom to $FREEDOM and then I reiterate the dangers associated with restricting the freedom.\r\n\r\nThe great thing about my policy is that:<ol> <li>I get to evangelise without shoving my belief down their throat (they WANT to know about my \"only Free software\" policy)</li>\r\n<li>I don't directly become an accessory to furthering Non-Free software</li>\r\n<li>it leads to me being absolved of MANY tech support requests. (I don't have to help maintain malware-infected Windows boxes ;) </li></ol>\r\n\r\nI managed to convert two people to use only free software because I promised to support them with their usage of free software to the best of my abilities. I also managed to educate and inform many others about free software. I even helped fixed a couple of instances relating to confusion (or FUD) relating to free software."

I will not recommend to anyone the usage of any piece of Non-Free software</blockquote>\r\n\r\nAh! This policy reminds me strongly of what my Catholic roommate used to tell me when I asked him why you don't see Catholics going door to door like Jehovah's Witnesses or Mormons. His explanation was that Catholics preferred to  \"evangelize\" by living a certain kind of life, and attracting the admiration of their neighbors and friends. If they asked him about Catholicism, he'd be happy to explain, but he would never go out of his way to \"witness\" to someone or debate with them about their religion. Obviously, he wanted to avoid the stigma associated with the \"guys in ties on bikes\" and the like that go with door-to-door \"fanati-tactics.\" \r\n\r\nIt'd be hilarious to get a knock on the door from some geeks who \"just want to ask about my computer's soul and whether it 'knows the gnu.'\"\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I think the point of the article was precisely that. If we limit ourselves to only talking about free software when it's opportune (i.e., when we're in some technical discussion about software), then we're severely hampering the movement. The way I see it, the philosophy is actually more important than free software itself. You might not want to seem \"fanatical\" about free software, but I bet you wouldn't mind being \"fanatical\" about freedom and making the world a better place. I think we have to start from that perspective, then work our way back to free software and explaining how we can use the latter to achieve the former."
