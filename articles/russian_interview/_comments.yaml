Did the writer fat-finger that sentence or is he/she a fascist that enjoys glorifying a regime of mass murder and cruelty.\r\n\r\n______________________________________________\r\n\r\n    From: Dave Guard (SUBSCRIBER!)\r\n    Url: http://www.freesoftwaremagazine.com\r\n    Date: 2006-03-12\r\n    Subject: Hold on! Think carefully about what you have read.\r\n\r\n    The quote you have offered says: \"Former Soviet Union\" not \"Soviet Union\". The author (Gianluca) is talking about the fact that it is no longer the Soviet Union. And this fact... \"often makes people think of a somehow original concept of freedom and democracy.\"\r\n\r\n    I think, if you read it correctly, it is clear that Gianluca is neither fat-fingered nor does he enjoy glorifying a regime of mass murder and cruelty.\r\n\r\n    It could be argued that the statement was written in such a way (unintentionally, I assure you) that leaves it easy to misunderstand.\r\n\r\n    Sorry for any confusion.\r\n\r\n    Dave\r\n\r\n    ______________________________________________\r\n\r\n    From: Gianluca Pignalberi\r\n    Url:\r\n    Date: 2006-03-13\r\n    Subject: I'm NOT a fascist!\r\n\r\n    Hi Jorge,\r\n\r\n    my wife lives in Belarus. They call their country a Republic. In spite of this, their president is not a president: he's a dictator. And a lot of them call him President, and say he's good (the others say everything whispering).\r\n\r\n    Since I'm not Belarusian, I clearly see it's not a democracy, and I wrote the introduction the way an Englishman would write it: understatement. If you like, read it \"Former Soviet Union is a term that recalls to many people lack of democracy, fear and death\". Please, go read the references. Why do you think I quoted those?\r\n\r\n    Sincerely.\r\n\r\n    ______________________________________________\r\n\r\n    From: Dmitry\r\n    Url:\r\n    Date: 2006-03-13\r\n    Subject: Relax\r\n\r\n    clause \"Former Soviet Union\" just means \"territory of ex-Soviet Union\" and nothing else. We so call in Russia.\r\n\r\n    ______________________________________________\r\n\r\n        From: Gianluca Pignalberi\r\n        Url:\r\n        Date: 2006-03-13\r\n        Subject: Relax: yes, we need some :)\r\n\r\n        Hi Dmitri,\r\n\r\n        yes, I forgot to mention now this important fact. But I added an old map to the article to think of it.\r\n\r\n        ______________________________________________\r\n\r\n    From: Sergey\r\n    Url:\r\n    Date: 2006-03-13\r\n    Subject: USSR\r\n\r\n    Have you ever been to USSR, ever lived there, etc. Do not talk on topics out of your expertise. Flush the propaganda off your head. Try to think, this may help.\r\n\r\n    To the author: the introduction sounds really bad to russian readers.\r\n\r\n    ______________________________________________\r\n\r\n        From: gianluca pignalberi\r\n        Url:\r\n        Date: 2006-03-14\r\n        Subject: Good or evil (stop flaming)\r\n\r\n        Date: 2006-03-14\r\n\r\n        Subject: Good or evil (stop flaming)\r\n\r\n        Hi Sergej (or Sergey, as you like :),\r\n\r\n        Maybe you're right, my introduction could sound bad to some people.\r\n\r\n        I've talked with a lot of people from the former Soviet Union and many of them were happy living in the USSR (it seems they were happier than they are now, living in the new republics). Anyway, there are people who don't approve of everything they've seen in their \"previous\" life. You are certainly right in saying what you say; mine is only one point of view. My opinion is based on what I have books I have read and from the (short) time that I lived there.\r\n\r\n        And, please, forgive me in advance; I wrote what my wife says about USA (and she is not alone in her opinion): it's not democracy. And this is my right to say so.\r\n\r\n        Anyway, in this sort of flame war we're loosing sight of the main topic: the importance of free software everywhere. I tried to focus the article on 3 republics of the former Soviet Union, and hopefully I'll get to do the same for the other countries.\r\n\r\n        Sincerely"
