    body: "Well, we had a pretty muddy start, possibly due to launching right at Thanksgiving (there was a short delay due to verifying my Amazon Payments account -- I should've done that a little earlier, it seems), or possibly due to the fact that we didn't really have an existing fan community yet. But after promoting the project and the Kickstart on social media sites (Facebook, Google+, Diaspora, Twitter, and Identica), and a few other places, things have picked up. We're at 29% with about 12 days to go now -- supposedly, according to Kickstarter's own stats, this means we should have about a 90% chance of making our goal.\r\n\r\nIt's kind of hard to believe that at the moment -- it seems like a long way to go still. But it's an interesting experience so far. So, I'm just going to keep posting [Kickstarter updates](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2144275086/lunatics-web-series-characters-and-pre-production/posts), promoting them, and hoping for the best. Kind of scary, but also exciting. :-)"

    body: "Wow -- the campaign stayed at 29% for a whole week. Not one single pledge. With less than 5 days to go, I then started directly contacting friends and acquaintances with an interest in space or free culture. That direct appeal seemed to have some effect, and now we're at 38%. That's still a LONG $1500 from the goal, and yet it's enough to not give up on it.\r\n\r\nTo quote John Cleese's character from \"Clockwork\", \"It's not the despair. It's the hope!\"\r\n\r\nWin or lose, I will definitely have to post a follow-up article with my impressions -- it's an interesting experience."

Amazingly, we made it to [63%](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2144275086/lunatics-web-series-characters-and-pre-production), with a dozen or so backers pledging in the morning. But it's slowed down again, and well, I still don't know if we'll make it or not!\r\n\r\nIf you run one of these yourself, I have to warn you to be ready for a lot of ups and downs. I get excited just following Kickstarter projects I've supported. But now that it's our [own project](http://lunatics.tv) on the line, I am on the edge of my seat the whole day through!"
