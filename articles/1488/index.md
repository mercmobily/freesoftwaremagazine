It can be difficult for free software projects to get the word out, especially without any corporate backing. My colleague Matt Raible has some [interesting points](http://www.virtuas.com/node/177) to make about this issue, along with advice on how to market your free software project (it generally comes down to reaching out to your community of users and contributors). And I would add one more point: assign a press contact who will be friendly and prompt with inquiries. I don’t know how many times I’ve contacted a project and received a late or half-hearted response. On the other hand, lots of projects are very good about being available when I need information or want to do an interview. Guess who gets written up! Assigning the right press contact and making that person easy to contact will go a long way toward getting the word out about your project.
