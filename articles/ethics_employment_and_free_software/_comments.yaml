    body: 'I can understand this being an ethical dilemma. However, maybe you didn''t look closely enough at what you may have accomplished from within. Look at Microsoft. There are daily reports showing their desire to start working with the Linux community. I have no delusions of an OpenWindows initiative, but due largely to employee Linux use, Microsoft is looking at the Linux community and seeing the potential in various areas. The movie and music communities will need intelligent employees to overcome the issues with piracy and DRM. If all the employees who want to see the system change leave the company, all that will be left is close-minded fools. These "fools" only know to file lawsuits to recuperate lost revenue streams. Neither the lawsuits or the piracy is helping the industry, the artists, or the customers.'

I think the important thing is to establish more and better <a href=\"http://www.freesoftwaremagazine.com/node/1865\">safe zones</a> for free arts, more than to make rash oaths about what you will or will not accept from existing employers. There's not much point until you have a way to make the system you want viable in itself.\r\n"

The Puritan level for me would be like becoming vegetarian having not eaten meat for a very long time: not exactly difficult, and whilst ethically agreeable would be quite a commitment nevertheless. It could happen soon though..."
