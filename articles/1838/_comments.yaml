    body: "So glad I could help you out. ;-)\r\n\r\nOf course, the irony is that the people arguing to allow DRM (i.e. who object to the \"corresponding source key\" requirement in the GPLv3 and the \"anti-TPM clause\" in the CCPL3) are doing so for idealogical reasons. They argue that these provisions excessively restrict \"user freedoms\".\r\n\r\nThe pragmatic argument can be made too, but it's always an adjunct.\r\n\r\nFundamentally these are questions of \"allowable copyleft\". The FSF wants a stronger copyleft, because some groups have found a loophole that allows them to effectively defeat copyleft.\r\n\r\nHowever, this conflicts with the one genuine difference between the \"free software definition\" and the \"open source definition\", which is that the open source definition permits a slightly stronger copyleft: a requirement that forces changes to be published. This, of course, was an earlier suggestion to defeat an earlier loophole used to defeat copyleft (the one used by Google: they don't have to publish their changes, because they don't \"distribute\" the software, they just let you use it on their siteâ€”forced publication would require those changes to be published anyway).\r\n\r\nTrying to rectify that as a \"principalled\" argument requires some pretty serious logical gymnastics. The truth is that you just have different people adopting different nuanced positions in the big fuzzy gray space, ultimately in service to the same goal. There's no bright lines to cross here, just some hand-placed chalk marks upon a wide-open field that happen to disagree a little bit about exactly where the foul line is.\r\n\r\n"

In this entry here I decided to take more of a straight advocacy approach because I really do believe in the idea of spreading the message and the debate provides that opportunity, even at the risk of alienating some people.\r\n\r\nThe question of how to treat code like Google's is an interesting one.  Crosbie Fitch over at <a href=\"http://www.digitalproductions.co.uk/\">Digital Productions</a> has some interesting things to say about this.  I share his interests in privacy, but there are also all these gray area challenges.  I don't want to force people to publish their private modifications, but as technology evolves and the methods of distributing software change, I'd hate for there to be ways around copyleft.\r\n\r\n<em>(EDIT: Durnit -- I hate it when I don't attach the reply to the comment.)</em>"

But it we must lump them together, one point of contention may be the fact that the Free Software nerds are a bit aggressive on how the word freedom is used.  Stallman only pushes \"freedom\" if it fits into his 4 part vision.  For people like me, Open Source contains other freedoms that \"Free Software\" does not.  Like the freedom to actually do whatever you want with the code (like sell it and not give away your modifications).  Or the freedom to include binary NVIDIA drivers that dont suck.  Or the freedom to at least attempt to prevent your customers from screwing around with your hardware.  Or the freedom use trademarked artwork.  Or the freedom to use terms like \"linux operating system\" or \"intellectual property\" without getting an irrelevant and unwanted lecture by a language hippie on why we must talk different.\r\n\r\nSome people like ideologies.  Some people need a techy religion/school of thought.  But some people just want cool stuff for free, preferably cool stuff that uses open protocols and patent-free formats and maybe even lets them pretend they are somehow fighting the man--a.k.a. Microsoft.  Free, for these people, has nothing to do with the legendary fixing of printer drivers."

If I can get the source code, but don't have the freedom to modify it and use it on my hardware, what good is it?\"\r\n\r\nYep. That's the case for both FSD and OSD licenses.\r\n\r\n\"When I use Google, I am definitely not using their software-- I am using the output of their software. That's a very important distinction.\"\r\n\r\nSort of. It's a matter of point of view (by this definition, you aren't using your browser software either, you're just interacting with it. Why the distinction? Is it because you own the CPU? Are you using software you run on someone else's computer? If I install software on a remote sever and use it through SSH, am I \"not using\" it?)\r\n\r\nBut of course, it can be claimed to be a stronger ideological value to share that work back to the community that created it (as easily as not). This is just the principle of \"copyleft\" at work: sharing improvements back to the community that created the work (you can think of this as a kind of \"payment\" for the work).\r\n\r\nMy point though isn't that Google should be forced to share, but that some people think they should. And categorizing those people as \"more pragmatic / less idealistic\" than the people who think they shouldn't is a massive misrepresentation. Obviously both sides are making arguments based on both principled and pragmatic reasons.\r\n\r\n\"Being able to modify free software for my own personal use without being forced to redistribute my changes is a nice, business-friendly feature, not a bug. Besides, any provision to force redistribution in that case would be unenforceable, and thus pointless.\"\r\n\r\nThis argues for the difference being trivial, not an all-important ideological distinction. Which again, is my point. There <em>is no</em> all-important ideological distinction. It's a picky little detail. More importantly, the difference does not hinge on this mythical \"pragmatic / ideological\" dividing line: pragmatic and ideological arguments can be (and have been) made for both sides of the issue.\r\n\r\nBear in mind that most open source licenses do <em>not</em> have this requirement, and it is regarded as \"bad practice\" by both \"free software\" and \"open source software\" advocates. It's just a matter of a line being drawn to circumscribe allowed behavior. And the difference between \"forced publication if used\" and \"forced distribution to anyone to whom the binary is distributed\" is subtle. In the vast majority of cases, they amount to the same requirement (e.g. if I put the binary on my website, I need to put the source there too).\r\n\r\n\"Dont' forget, the term \"copyleft\" is just a play on words. Every so-called copyleft license is based on, and worthless without, copyright law.\"\r\n\r\nBy and large correct.\r\n\r\nHowever, just FYI, this statement depends on jurisdiction and license. In some jurisdictions and for some licenses, the license <em>is</em> a contract (\"license\" not being a distinct legal concept in those jurisdictions, or the license being actually a EULA).\r\n\r\nA contract or \"license agreement\" <em>can</em> remove \"fair use\"/\"fair dealing\" rights. I don't like the idea any more than you do, but it's the law. That's why the Creative Commons licenses explicitly grant \"fair use/fair dealing\" permission (because despite what the legally obsolete preamble to the GPL says, these rights <em>can</em> be taken away by the \"license\". IIRC, GPLv3 will be fixing this problem as one of its many <em>un</em>controversial changes).\r\n"

Freedom 1 - The freedom to study how the program works, and adapt it to your needs (in which case, the source code is required for this) ensures that the program is Open Source.  I think all too often we have confused \"free\" with \"free beer\" instead of using it in the context of \"free speech\".\r\n\r\nIf a program is modified and those modifications are sold along with the original source code, then that does not stop the next user (there really are no 'end' users where open source softwre is concerned) from using or further modifying the code to meet their needs.
