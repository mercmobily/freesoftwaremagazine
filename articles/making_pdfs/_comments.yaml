    body: "I think, there's just too much confusion regarding what types of freedom Free Software give/s, even to the point that people from the Free Software movement are divided regarding the matter.\r\n\r\nIt helps to examine what is the problem with the proprietary software model in relation to software development and its implications to the environment it is affecting.  Proprietary software is software that is controlled/owned by a specific individual, company or group of companies.  This ownership is (evidently) beneficial to that specific subset of the population.  Much of the benefits come from its central model of product delivery and its (almost) omnicient, omnipotent, omnibenevolent, etc. control over the software; thus, it is VERY profitable (read: Microsoft).  Well, one might think that this is all plain and well; this is good business perhaps.  But when we look at the other side of the coin, we see the end users; the END users.  These are people who actually USE the software; people who MUST be concern with how the software must evolve into something that is USEFUL to them.  It is, therefore, important that these end users be able to control the software they are using.  To be able to do this, they must also control the software's source code and be able to participate (either directly or indirectly) in its development as WANTED or NEEDED.  This is freedom as in Free Software.  Notice that copylefted Free Software (i.e. Free Software covered by GNU GPL) doesn't violate this freedom.  It excludes proprietary software from taking it and turning it into something proprietary.  The whole point is that, copylefted Free Software doesn't TAKE away the freedom from proprietary software developers; they can still modify, improve, derive, etc. from copylefted Free Software.  What they are not allowed to do is to TAKE away the freedom they have FROM the remaining of the population.  This is similar to the concept of taking away the freedom to kill so that the freedom to live is preserved (only not as horrible).\r\n\r\nOne final note: I believe that these arguments are pretty much pragmatic and are not necessarily anti-commercial.  It helps to read with an open mind. ;)"

They do not generate any links! :(\r\n  So links means say \"A direct link from Table of content to actual page cannot be created!\"  with the most of these Free PDF printers... can someone throw a light on how to do that?\r\n\r\n\r\nTushar Gokhale\r\nhttp://geocities.com/gokhaletushar/"
