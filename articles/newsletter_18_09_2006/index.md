Greetings, readers and subscribers, and welcome to Free Software Magazine’s new and improved fortnightly newsletter.

In the past, our newsletters have consisted of article-style content that we here at FSM thought would be of interest to you. Don’t worry, these articles haven’t disappeared - they will appear as online articles on our site. Our new newsletters are designed to keep you up-to-date about recent articles, competitions and issues, new site features, and keeps you informed about what’s going on at FSM.


# General announcements

And what an exciting general announcement it is - Issue 14 is now available on paper! As those of you who have been with us for the long haul may remember, we started out with the goal of being a print magazine. We were always going to release on the website, but the focus was goign to be on paper magazines. Anyway, that became unsustainable and we took a step back and contented ourselves with keeping the online versions coming. Thanks to all of you out there, we now have a very wide reader base and we know that many of you are still interested in the idea of receiving a paper mag. Well, we have decided to have the best of both worlds - a print mag AND an online mag! That’s right, using the services of lulu.com, we are now officially in print. Issue 14 is available at this very moment for purchase on [Lulu](http://www.lulu.com), so for those of you who are interested in receiving your very own paper copy in the mail, with its attractive colour cover and b/w stock, head to our our [Lulu storefront](http://www.lulu.com/fsm)! Back issues are also available. Issue 14 will be available for download in 30 days, so if you order the paper Issue 14 it should arrive just before the downloadable one. And, all the articles in the paper mag are still released under a free license. Happy reading!


# New features


## FSM banners available

We've had quite a few emails from readers asking for us to provide FSM banners so they can put them on their websites. Well, our graphic designer Alan of [Qreate](http://www.qreate.net/) has come up with [a few banners](http://www.freesoftwaremagazine.com/contribute/banners) for you to choose from. There are banners to suit all tastes, from the more subdued and serious to the diehard FSM loons. 

If you have your own website and you would like to support FSM, then please post a banner on your site and help us out. Remember people you send our way will be in good hands - the hands of the free software community.

# Reminders

**Comments**

Your comments on articles, issues, and blog entries are very welcome. They provide other readers with insightful suggestions, further information, and the feeling that they are not alone. They also provide our authors with the feeling that they are being heard. Please comment wherever possible and **don’t forget to log in** so that you’ll be in the running to win the [latest book competition](http://www.freesoftwaremagazine.com/blog/1).

**Avatars**

Avatars are a great way of expressing your personal identity, whether it be a photo or an image that you feel represents the you you want to be. Read more about avatars [here](http://www.freesoftwaremagazine.com/node/1713). To add an avatar: log in, go to “my account” in the menu on the left, go to the “edit” tab and scroll down to where it says “Upload picture”. Now, hit the browse button, find the image on your computer that you want to upload and go to the bottom of the page and hit the submit button. That’s it; you now have an avatar image.

**Donations**

As you might know already FSM is a low profit project with all funds raised going back into producing the fine magazine you can download for free. Our staff and authors sadly still receive little to no monetary reward for their good service.

Think about how much you would normally have to spend buying a magazine of this quality. Now, perhaps, consider donating part of that amount for each issue you've read. We would appreciate it.

Your donations will help us to continue spreading the word about free software and producing more fantastic issues.
