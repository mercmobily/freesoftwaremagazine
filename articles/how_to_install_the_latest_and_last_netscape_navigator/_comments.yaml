Hence maybe off-topic here at FSM?\r\n\r\nIt sounds like the LinkPad and MiniBrowser are providing much the same functionality as \"tabbed browsing\" in Mozilla/Firefox. (?)\r\n\r\nI used to use Galeon, and the one thing I miss from it is that you could drag and drop tabs to rearrange them -- I liked to keep related tabs next to each other for more effective navigation. With the existing Navigator apps, you have to exercise a lot of discipline with the order in which you open tabs if you want to achieve that, and I find that annoying.\r\n\r\nThis kind of organization is particularly useful when doing online comparison shopping or when using the browser to consult library documentation during development.\r\n\r\nI suppose some form of hierarchical tabs would also help with that (tabs as containers of other tabs as well as linking to a URL could be used to contain useful subpages under a site home page link).\r\n\r\nHowever, even though I see potential for improvement, the basic tabbed browsing feature is extremely useful as-is.\r\n"
