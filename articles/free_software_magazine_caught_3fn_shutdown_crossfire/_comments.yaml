They might be protecting people (and even that is debatable) by prosecuting crimes here, but guilty or innocent, Americans MUST pay to support them. As a result, they can and do walk all over people with no regard to the impact is has on them.\r\n\r\nGovernment is a monopoly on the use of aggressive force. It is any surprise that given that monopoly, they make heavy handed use of it?"
