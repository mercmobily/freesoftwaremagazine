An ivory tower intellectual trying to tell me why I do something.  Like analysits of Charles Dodgson, trying to read too much into something.\r\n\r\n<hr/>\r\n\r\n<strong>From</strong>: bored reader \r\n<strong>Url</strong>: \r\n<strong>Date</strong>: 2005-12-09\r\n<strong>Subject:</strong> foolishness\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat a self aggrandizing way to stretch the sentence, \"A continual reevealutaion of one's morality is a worthwhile endeavor\", into a lot of supercilious claptrap. I had to read it all the way through just to see how many times you would drag those Latin phrases kicking and screaming back into your essay. If you want to have any impact in the world you need to develop the ability to be understood by the world. Otherwise, you're just spouting into your own preening self-reflection.  \r\n\r\n<hr/>\r\n\r\n<strong>From</strong>: Chris \r\n<strong>Url</strong>: \r\n<strong>Date</strong>: 2005-12-10\r\n<strong>Subject:</strong> HA!\r\n\r\n\r\nThat Nietzsche for you.  \r\n\r\n<hr/>\r\n\r\n"
