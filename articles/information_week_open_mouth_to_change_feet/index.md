  In trying to respond to  recent [criticism  about misrepresenting facts](http://fsfe.org/en/fellows/ciaran/ciaran_s_free_software_notes/misleading_informationweek_gplv3_article) regarding Linus Torvalds  and [GPLv3](http://fsfeurope.org/projects/gplv3/),  InformationWeek has managed to show exactly how incorrect their  first article was.

  Their misleading GPLv3 article from last week drew criticism for  using false evidence to suggest that Linus is on a new anti-GPLv3  and that Linus's insults are "_the latest sign of a growing  schism_".

  Now they've done something very strange.  In their new article  "The Linus Files, Part Two", they've dug up further,  slightly older, insults which Linus has levelled at FSF, and they're  presenting these as some kind of proof that their first article was  accurate.  An attempt at a  classic [Straw man  tactic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_man), albeit executed so poorly that they've shot themselves  in the foot.

  By digging up older criticism, and being unable to find or provoke  anything new, they've just shown that there is nothing new at all to  report.  No new phenomenon, no widening of an old rift.  You could  even conclude that things are calming down.
