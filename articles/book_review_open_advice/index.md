A lot of people work hard trying to benefit Free Software. All together, we make a difference. Then again, some people manage to make a _huge_ difference. They are sometimes lucky, but most often than not just immensely dedicated. Well, if you want to hear the opinions of dedicated people heavily involved in free software, this is the book for you.

Read [Open Advice](http://open-advice.org) online!

<!--break-->

The book contains a piece by Evan Prodromou's  (the founder of Wikitravel, StatusNet and Identi.ca), "Everyone Else Might Be Wrong, But Probably Not", about stubbornness and taking ideas on board. Other very dedicated people give their opinion on working on free software.

The book is divided into sections:

* Ideas and Innovation
* Research
* Mentoring and Recruiting
* Infrastructure
* Code
* Quality Assurance
* Documentation and Support
* Translation
* Usability
* Artwork and Design
* Community Management
* Packaging
* Promotion
* Conferences and Sprints
* Business
* Legal and Policy

Each section has a number of essays written by people who actually work (and work hard) in the field and help Free Software.

Enjoy!
