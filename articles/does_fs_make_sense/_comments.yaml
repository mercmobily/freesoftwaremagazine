Microsoft does not follow standards. They take most of a standard and change it a bit so that software following the standard cannot work well with Windows. I recommend cold turkey switches to Linux to avoid these complications. This works well with small to medium operations where the usual servers can be replaced in a day and the usual desktop installations can be replaced by Linux Terminal Server in a day. If this is done on a non-working weekend, there is plenty of time to diagnose difficulties and fix them or revert to the previous state. If the operation is too large or this abrupt change is not feasible, I recommend using free software in the Windows environment until the nerves calm down and the training period passes, and then switching to Linux one department at a time. Either way, the long term gain is worth a bit of short term pain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMost of the problems I have seen lately are not problems with free software, but the perception of it with the potential users. Only last week a professional in my organization told me Linux was pirated software and we should not use it... Last month our chief technologist told me he was worried by the thought of adding 20 PCs to our system let alone running Linux on them. I gave him a list of 12 advantages of using LTSP (Linux Terminal Server Project) with the new machines and all he could come up with was \"but our users are used to Windows... and we would like to do that but we do not want to maintain two systems\". At the same time, our techs are running themselves ragged trying to keep up with routine problems of Windows systems. Some problems do not get fixed for weeks. I pointed out that we do not need anything that Windows offers that Linux cannot supply and that there would be much less work maintaining a few terminal servers compared to hundreds of thick clients. We are still using Windows except in my department where we use both and my Linux users have no problems and my Windows users are a burden. It is like standing outside in bitter winter weather because we are afraid to open the door.\r\n\r\n<hr/>\r\n\r\n<strong>From</strong>: Eduardo Cruz \r\n<strong>Url</strong>: \r\n<strong>Date</strong>: 2005-12-10\r\n<strong>Subject:</strong> free software\r\n\r\n\r\nThis comment by Robert Podson is so typical of the Linux-free software devotees...\"Most of the problems I have seen lately are not problems with free software\".  \r\n\r\nAlways, the problem is the users (dumb), Microsoft (always must have a hand in it), the rest of us, whom are not clever enough to understand the higher meaning of things, etc., etc.  We in business need things to work, and if they do not work, I want someone here to fix it, yesterday.  Whether they cost little or lots of money, usability is the key!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have been running some version of Linux (Suse now) in dual boot windows machines for several years now.  On a laptop, while running Linux, the computer crashes and reboot quite often.  On desktops, it crashes my network or itself.  So, in the dependability arena I would not ditch windows for it. I run Linux for the experience, but in fact, there isn't any reason to have it.   What can I do in Linux that I cannot do in windows?  Nothing.  At least in windows my fonts are better on my eyes thanks to Clear Type. \r\n\r\nBecause is free?  My time is too valuable.  In many ways it is more expensive, if in fact you were to help those companies doing some of the heavy work in Linux and buy it.  Suse Linux cost around $80 retail with manuals and 90 days support.  Anyone can buy windows home edition for about $100-120, and it works, period. \r\n\r\nLook at the most successful free program, Open office.  Who has done all the work for Open Office?  It has not been the so-called community, but the 100 or so programmers working at Sun.  You need that continuity to make it happen.\r\n\r\nI just happen to be able to fix the things that go wrong when they go wrong.  How many hours has it taken me to get my wireless running in Linux?  You don't have enough hands and feet to count.  But how about the regular computer user?  Why should he spend the hours and frustration necessary to get a Linux system running right? Most do not care, and that is why they stick with windows.\r\n\r\nIt is not a religion, as many want it to be.  Right now windows works better, tomorrow, who knows?  Maybe in a couple years, Linux, any flavor, will be ready to compete with windows, and I don't mean just to be able to load it on any pc, I mean to work from the get go, without having to spend countless hours tinkering with it and posting and reading in forums to get things right.  Build me a better mousetrap and I will buy it.\r\n\r\nDon't tell me about updates, etc.  I have to update suse just as much.  Thanks god for my broadband! And forget about viruses...who wants to write a virus for a three percent user base when you have the 800 pound gorilla to wreck havoc with?  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLike the article explains, Linux followers love their once a month updates, and new kernel number, whatever .5667 it is at the time, their new KDE 3.5 upgrade, that either crashes or slow, or may work just fine in your system.  That creates chaos in a working business environment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou better start listening to the likes of the writer.  He has free software better interests in mind.  For myself, I like to see some competition in the field.  It makes all the companies edgy.  That is why I want Linux to stick around.  But you can't hide behind excuses all the time if you do not want Linux to end up like those great little OS's of the past.  Remember, CPM, DR-DOS, Amiga, Atari, OS-2, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr/>\r\n\r\n<strong>From</strong>: Tony Mobily  <b>(SUBSCRIBER!)</b>\r\n<strong>Url</strong>: http://www.mobily.com\r\n<strong>Date</strong>: 2005-12-10\r\n<strong>Subject:</strong> Not quite\r\n\r\n\r\nHello,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n-------\r\n\r\nQUOTE:\r\n\r\nWe in business need things to work, and if they do not work, I want someone here to fix it, yesterday.

Harware makers are already (and finally, I may add) creating machines that are guaranteed to work on Linux. This is not a \"Linux problem\". This is part of the normal evolution of an operating system. Now that enough people are using it, and the market is significant, hardware makers will make PCs and laptops which will definitely work on Linux, 100%.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n--------\r\n\r\nQUOTE:\r\n\r\nAnd forget about viruses...who wants to write a virus for a three percent user base when you have the 800 pound gorilla to wreck havoc with?\r\n\r\n---------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQuestion: what's 3% of TEN MILLION?\r\n\r\nDo you know that it's much, much harder to create a virus for Linux than it is for Windows?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n---------\r\n\r\nQUOTE:\r\n\r\nLike the article explains, Linux followers love their once a month updates, and new kernel number, whatever .5667 it is at the time, their new KDE 3.5 upgrade, that either crashes or slow, or may work just fine in your system.

Let me tell you what Windows users have had to put up with in my organization:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    For three months, 24 new staff and all the students have not been able to print on a common Laserjet. The techs had set up every machine in the building with a new \"profile\" that did not include a printer definition. After repeated technical service requests, this item finally made it up the queue and was fixed. The day after the techs left, the students can now print, but now none of the staff can without an \"add printer\" operation. Our techs are smart people and quite competent, but after spending hours trying to get XP service pack 2 onto all our PCs and getting only some to install, they ran short of time and had to rush off to the next location. This is on a system locked down so tightly that no one can wiggle. The hard drives are re-written at every reboot to combat malware. The techs are supposed to be able to maintain the software remotely but often they cannot get in because Windows ignores them. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    On the other hand, I have a single Linux server to maintain and all my users have been able to print from day one. Not one of my users has lost a file either. My system goes for weeks without a reboot and runs most of the processes for 22 users simultaneously whereas our Windows systems run processes for one user and many files have been lost due to freezes. I would say Linux works here and Windows does not. Last year I was in a shop where Windows worked pretty well except that the scanner could not be used after Service Pack 2 and the computers in the lab needed to be re-imaged. It took many hours to do this. Microsoft asserted its right to install Service Pack 2 without our permission and broke our system.\r\n\r\n<hr/>\r\n\r\n<strong>From</strong>: Richard Corfield \r\n<strong>Url</strong>: \r\n<strong>Date</strong>: 2005-12-11\r\n<strong>Subject:</strong> Processes, design outweigh the \"Free/Proprietry\" choice\r\n\r\n\r\nYes you can patch alpha software into the linux kernel and make all sorts of interesting things happen. You can develop on DotNet2 beta using experimental new features if you wish. If your business needs that kind of cutting edge software then it can employ people to manage it. Some businesses do.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo much of what many businesses want can be achieved with commodity Linux software. Install Apache or Tomcat or JBoss or MySQL or PostGres or Eclipse. This is software that a lot of people know how to use. Set up proper processess and documentation - something missing in too many companies I expect! - and there's no need to worry about managing it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCase in point, the company I worked for lost their Linux guy for 6 months with cancer. The linux systems didn't fail in this time, but it wasn't a risk anyway. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe entire process to recover the automated backups onto clean PCs using original media for software were documented, tested and the other UNIX admins in the organisation were familliar with them. We had them try it using the previous night's automated backup and tested the resulting system. The same instructions were used in other offices once the initial pilot was deemed a success.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart of the decision to try Linux was based on the knowledge that the software (Apache, Tomcat, an in-house Java application and source control in CVS) was available for Solaris should the Linux experiment fail. Potential permanent loss of the main Linux guy was not a risk.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor a process like this to work, it must be repeatable. A lot of the good Linux software is highly modular and loosly coupled. This is a good software design goal in its own right and true open standards help in this goal. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere in a tightly coupled (heavily integrated) system a small change in one module can cost hours of support or developer time to adjust, the looser coupled system is more resilient. There is far more freedom to deal with a small change to Apache or Tomcat, or even to completely swap them out if need be, without breaking the rest of the system.\r\n\r\n<hr/>\r\n\r\n"
