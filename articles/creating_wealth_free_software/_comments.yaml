    body: "> The report identifies the value of these ‘open source’ products to be about 6% of the world market for software\r\n\r\nThis number isn't very useful unless you know how they arrived at it, or to whom they meant this value to apply.\r\n\r\nAre they saying that the $60 billion loss was 6% of the total? Or are they saying that the open source industry earns about 6% of the total of the proprietary software industry.\r\n\r\nThe economics gets dicey because the costs of IT are severely artificially inflated due to proprietary monopoly tactics. Thus, when you introduce a free market (i.e. open source), the \"value\" plummets (which is what it should do when the artificial props are removed).\r\n\r\n(If we're actually spending $1 trillion a year on IT budgets, then I'm betting we're paying way too much!)\r\n\r\nThe money to be made from free software is a lot less than the money made from proprietary software, but that's as it should be: free software more closely approximates a free market, so competition means lower prices. Things should stabilize at a sustainable level, but it will mean much smaller IT budgets! So it won't be good from everyone's PoV.\r\n"
