    body: "Thanks for the post John - very helpful. I am currently using satellite in country Western Australia and would like to change to mobile because connecting a router to the satellite modem causes all sorts of problems. My house is has very thick walls and a metal roof and mobile signals inside are poor to non existent. Also the construction of the house makes it difficult to run an aerial cable. Is there a way of having an external aerial connected wirelessly to a USB modem? Obviously the external aerial would need to be powered separately. This would save me a lot of trouble in running an aerial lead.\r\n"
