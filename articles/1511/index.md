There’s a nice article on Donation Coder today called [When Do Users Donate? Experiments with Donationware: Ethical Software, Work Equalization, Temporary Licenses, Collective Bargaining, and Microdonations](http://www.donationcoder.com/Articles/One/index.html). The article points out some of the common problems collecting donations and some very valuable do’s and don’ts. For instance: “While you may be tempted to tell your users that if they don’t donate you won’t be able to continue coding, this is probably a very bad idea for a software developer.” Read the report for the reason why!
