This is a loose collection of articles about the challenges I'm facing as I work on two animated video projects. One is the [Morevna Project](http://www.morevnaproject.org) started by Konstantin Dmitriev. The other is a project I'm working on with my wife, Rosalyn Hunter, called [Lunatics](http://lunatics.tv).

Both projects combine free culture and free software issues, since they will not only be released as a free culture works, but will also be made using free software tools.
