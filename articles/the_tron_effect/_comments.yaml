    body: "Anthony,\r\nThis is an awesome story. I'm a bit of a late geek bloomer. I had been working on computers for about 10 years before I found I wasn't alone. In 2003 I started working in software support for a small software company. I had owned a small PC shop in a small rural Georgia community, but I really didn't have any geek customers. Mostly older moms and dads who needed stuff installed or viruses removed. The software company was filled with geeks like me. They knew all the code words: forty-two, African or European, and Han shot first. I was finally where I belong. Thanks for sharing your story."

They did not speak Russian, but they did speak pretty much any other language we could think of (English, French, Spanish, German).\r\n\r\nI remember one night, when they got surrounded by about 20 russian geeks throwing questions at them in all the broken foreign languages in parallel. And the guys answered it back in the language they were asked. \r\n\r\nThat was true multitasking! :-)\r\n"

I didn't actually attend a full-fledged computer camp though, rather, I took classes on TRS-80, Commodore PET, and of course Apple II. Taught myself BASIC, parents bought me an Atari 800 in Christmas 1981 and started typing in all sorts of graphics and sound programs. From there moved to the Macintosh in 1984 (Forth, PASCAL, etc.) and the rest is pretty much history.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, my friend is writing up a storyline/script for a film which pretty much sums up our childhood growing up in Silicon Valley in the 1980s (specifically, Sunnylvale, CA where I was raised). From dumpster diving in Verbatim's trash (we'd score 1000+ usable 5 1/4\" floppies per dive) to riding our bicycles past Atari's old headquarters (in Sunnyvale), we did it all. We had no idea that computers would play such a vital role in our futures.\r\n\r\n-Brett"

I thought I was the only one guy interested in computers back in that time, but I had the grateful experience to share with folks like H. Pérez, M. Helsiniev and P. Popotamec (whose father ran the programming club), they were such incredible enthusiasts. We had a Commodore 64 which we programmed for long hours after repeatedly watching Star Trek and Star Wars. I remember that once we connected the C64 to the Angel of the Amparo (a big light bulbs sculpture from the electrical company), and we generated fibonacci sequences for turning the lights on. Those guys grew up to work in places like MIT, Caltech and NASA. Now we are getting back together in Las Vegas next year. You should try to get back with your friends I am sure if they are geeks they will find you in Google, just like I found mine.'

    body: "I can't begin to tell you how much this story touched my very soul (even though I just did - ;^)\r\n\r\nHow heartwarming and comprehensibly understandable a textual verbosity it is. I can relate to your experience on so many levels and I believe, much as your article expresses, that many other \"geeks\" can as well.\r\n\r\nI was in junior high school when I memorized most of Monty Python’s albums with my friend. Most of the lines are indelibly etched upon my brain cells and still subject to recall.\r\n\r\nWhen Tron came out in 1982, I was already married and heading toward my first divorce. Be that as it may, I was deeply entranced by my Commodore VIC20 learning Basic. I didn’t even have a tape recorder to save and store programs, having to rewrite my code ever time I wanted to use it.\r\n\r\nYears passed and after my first divorce, back living with my parents, I dove headfirst into the wonderfulness that was the Amiga 1000. It was for advanced over the average, everyday, ordinary PC that I thought I was the cat’s ass! What a fantastic machine it was.\r\n\r\nI eventually graduated to the Amiga 2000 and went on to the Amiga 4000 with a Video Toaster and Video Flyer. Whoooo – those were heady days for me. By that time, I had already remarried and, after the death of Commodore, I purchased, although regretfully, my first IBM-compatible PC. That computer was left behind in the second divorce, but I got myself one of them there new-fangled Packard-Bell PC’s. About a year and several upgrades had passed when it finally passed its last bit and went on to the great processor in the sky.\r\n\r\nBy then I had had it with PC makers and so-called white-box vendors and started building my own. After building two powerful machines which have long outlived anything made in a factory, I have just finished building a new 64-bit workstation; Windows 2003 file server, Linux web server, and a software development workstation. I also get married for the third (and FINAL) time.\r\n\r\nAlong the way, I developed a voracious appetite for robotics, particularly the autonomous humanoid variety. I built and furnished an engineering lab to get my fix of all things robotic and electronic - however, I can’t seem to get my fill…\r\n\r\nOver the course of 29 years, the few friends I did have faded into the background although I still communicate with a couple of them far and between. I never really again found that camaraderie that you so eloquently spoke of. It has become a very isolated existence for me, here on the threshold of my third (and FINAL) divorce.\r\n\r\nTaking online courses to finally earn my Bachelor of Science degree in Information Technology at 48 years of age, I can look back with bittersweet fondness upon the years that brought me to this point in my universe of geekdom.\r\nAnd I wouldn’t trade it for anything!\r\n\r\nThank you for writing your story and sharing it with the rest of us life-long computer “geeks.” It was well worth waiting for.\r\n\r\nColdCore\r\n\r\n"

    body: "In 1982, a fellow geek friend of mine convinced me to see Tron on opening day in Philadelphia. We were both about 15 years old and totally addicted to computers. I lived in the 'burbs and so we never told my parents just WHERE we were going (Chestnut St., center city Philadelphia), and HOW we would get there (trolley). It was a long ride into the big city and we were a bit nervous. The trolley dropped us off just a few blocks from the theater and on the way, we happened upon a large arcade that was featuring the Midway Tron arcade game! Intrigued, we went in and played a few games and so missed the first 5 minutes of the movie. \r\n\r\nWe sat, stunned, through the whole thing and stayed to watch it again. When I finally got home, I convinced my dad to take us to see it one more time at the drive-in that night. Yep. Three viewings of Tron on the first day! It was that movie that convinced me to get into programming and 3D design. Even though only 15 minutes of the movie had actual computer graphics, it was just the thought of the future opening up right in front of us that was so exciting. \r\n\r\nI knew before I saw Tron that I enjoyed playing with computers, but Tron convinced me that I needed to work with them also. If you have a career you enjoy, there was probably a moment in your life where you were SURE that was what you wanted to be involved with. 1982 was an exciting time to live in - computers were primative, but finally becoming useful for regular users. Moore's Law was becoming more and more evident in everything from consumer electronics to music, and that technology was shaping society in very real, measurable ways. Although, most of our peers still didn't understand what we saw in computers and why we were so interested in them. Us geeks felt like pioneers back then, I guess. We knew it was only a matter of time before everyone was using a computer even though to most people (including my own parents), it was the most alien of activities.\r\n\r\nI later got involved in communications and networking (always had a thing for that mystical I/O tower concept) - and that's what I do now. My buddy got his computer engineering degree and works designing VOIP solutions. Both of us have never forgotten that day and the feeling that we were right in pursuing our dreams.\r\n\r\nBTW, if you haven't gotten the 25th anniversary edition of Tron on DVD - DO SO! Not only does it have the original 'Pac-Man' version of the film (cleaned up, of course), but it also has a second DVD with all sorts of incredible info on the making/designing of the movie. It is unreal how this movie came to be and how it was finally executed. "
