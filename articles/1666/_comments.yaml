    body: "I have heard so many linux/mac people say this, but the reality of the world is, everyone on the planet with rare exception, grows up using a PC.  So everyone knows how to use it instinctively.  Most linux/mac based software has a completely different way of doing the same thing.. so though it may be actually easier if you had never used a computer before, after getting a windows mindset, almost all linux and mac based programs are utterly confusing.\r\n\r\nMy point is, if you want to get windows users to use your mac/linux applications, make them more windows like.  I understand the quandry here, but it is a reality.  90% of computer users (give or take), are windows users, and if you want to get them, you must write software they can use without any effort.  Open office for example.  Totally unusable for a Office XP user... plus it is ugly, so visually people don't like the change.\r\n\r\nPhotoshop is a prime example in the reverse.  It is singly the most annoying graphics application on the planet.  All the floating windows are utterly painful.  This is a mac based interface, and it pisses off PC users no end.  However... most users in the graphic art area are mac users, so to get mac users to buy PCs, you need to write programs that work with their brain.  \r\n\r\nAs a windows user who is realitively adept at learning new things, I would only start using linux if 2 things happened:\r\n1. There were free replacement applications that looks better, runs faster, and operates the same (not easier).\r\n2. Linux had the ability to run PC games better... sounds stupid, but this is the prime reason linux has little hope of becoming number one.  People who work hard, want the option to play as well, without switching operating systems to do so.  Cause reality, if your current operating system does everything you want it to, why switch?  Sad to say piracy removes \"free\" as a valid incentive to many users.\r\n\r\nThe second one is a tough one, and possibly not as nessesary, but the first is vital for any linux developer."

For example, I've seen Windows programmers cheerfully pay for an image viewing component.  An image viewer?!?  Those things are a dime-a-dozen; I can't imagine actually spending money on such a thing.  No, I wouldn't think anything of your buying IDEA if that's what works for you.  Just don't turn around the next day and buy a library to send email.\r\n\r\n<em>Please disabuse yourself of the notion that any business will standardise on anything other than a Windows desktop.</em>\r\n\r\nToo late.  It's already happening.  I've seen Linux installations creeping into unexpected places, such as the receptionist's desk, where the users need a small set of commodity software (word processor, email client, web browser) and little else.  Why spend money on Windows + Office when there's little or no marginal increase on return?"

One thing that I have come to believe in the course of doing this work is that no one has really shown that using a free software stack provides a compelling cost structure that provides a business comparative advantage.\r\n\r\nFor instance, we make drilling mud and cat litter.  If I can adpot a free stack or a mixed free/commercial stack and so lower my costs that it shows up in bottom line terms as a redecution in Admin costs that is really significant, I can leverage my cost advantage to compete better in my market.  Failing that, I have to use really flawed concepts like TCO that are too local to IT and do not quantify a real business comparative advantage.\r\n\r\nLinux and free software are really good products.  But can I really rule the drilling mud and cat litter world if I go to a free software stack?  I'm sure our CEO would like to know if that is the case.\r\n\r\nMore to the point if you could point out a business where that had already been shown to be the case, I should think you would really be able to make this type of case."

New businesses have no such overhead and Linux will help them be more competitive. Big businesses that wish to reduce costs can convert, but they have more conversion headaches.\r\n\r\nMy current project is a new school. An old subnet will be moved from the old school with Windows for a particular application. The rest of the school, 150 seats, will be all Linux thin clients. This dramatically reduces the cost per seat of hardware acquisition and the saving on Microsoftian licences will go to new hardware. The school will have twice as much hardware as they could have with the budget if they had stuck with Windows. Businesses can see the advantages of lower TCO in capital cost and operations. For simple desktop tasks not requiring custom software there is plenty of quite usable software available on Linux. I have been using nothing but Linux in schools for seven years and the choices get better every year. If teachers and students can handle Linux with very little effort, there is nothing holding you back.\r\n\r\n\r\nA problem is an opportunity."

    body: "I'm as disenchanted with TCO as you are, but sometimes you have to make some educated guesses.  As I mentioned <a href=\"http://www.freesoftwaremagazine.com/node/1654\">in another blog</a> my company's business logic is buried in many years' worth of Visual FoxPro.  The problem is that the writing is on the wall (in this case, <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/vfoxpro/productinfo/faq/default.aspx\">MS's VFP FAQ</a>): it will never become a .NET language, it will never be ported to 64-bit platforms, and the database will never support more than 2GB.  Their new internal development \"will also help improve the ability for Visual FoxPro 9.0 solutions to be successfully deployed on the upcoming new Windows operating system Microsoft Vista (formerly code named Longhorn)\", and I leave it to the reader to decide exactly what \"ability [...] to be successfully deployed\" means (is the current VFP runtime incompatible with Vista in some way that they're trying to fix?).\r\n\r\nIn short, its future looks bleak, and here we sit with some rather unpleasant options.  Do we wait it out and hope that Microsoft updates FoxPro to something we'll still be able to use ten years from now?  Or do we spend a few man-years porting our mission-critical code to a different language?  If we pick the former and guess wrong, we're beyond screwed.  If we pick the latter and guess wrong, my boss is out a few hundred thousand dollars.\r\n\r\nI honestly don't know how you calculate those issues into TCO.  In our case, picking the proprietary solution either saved us thousands of dollars by providing an easy-to-use IDE that enabled us to get more work done, or cost us hundreds of thousands of dollars by yanking the rug out from under us.  We have no ability to influence the outcome, so all we can do is hope that Microsoft decides to be gentle."

    body: "<cite>.. everyone on the planet with rare exception, grows up using a PC.</cite>\r\n\r\nIgnoring the fact that you mention a hardware architecture when you are referring to an operating system, there's also the small matter of there being about 6 billion people in the world. Of those approximately 12 per-cent use personal computers[1]. So \"everyone on the planet\" is a little over the top I think.\r\n\r\n<cite>So everyone knows how to use it instinctively.</cite>\r\n\r\nInstinctively? That is a bold statement to make. I would have said no piece of technology can claim to be \"instinctive\" without prior user exposure to similar technologies. Perhaps the people you describe are more used to a certain set of features and functions but that does not make those features instinctive any more than a car is instinctive if you've only driven motorcycles.\r\n\r\n<cite>Most linux/mac based software has a completely different way of doing the same thing..</cite>\r\n\r\nSorry but this statement just highlights the fact that you do not have much experience of free software applications and it is patently untrue. I could rattle off examples for ages but to use one: to create a new mail message in Kmail  I click on a toolbar icon that looks like an envelope with a sparkle on it or I can click the File menu and select New Message or I can press CTRL+N. ALL of these are near-identical to the way I would do it in Outlook.\r\n\r\n<cite>My point is, if you want to get windows users to use your mac/linux applications, make them more windows like.\r\nI understand the quandary here, but it is a reality. 90% of computer users (give or take), are windows users, and if you want to get them, you must write software they can use without any effort. Open office for example. Totally unusable for a Office XP user... plus it is ugly, so visually people don't like the change.\r\n</cite>\r\n\r\nProprietary applications often have varying interfaces. Some use the Windows API, some don't. Some use parts of it and others choose not to. Some Microsoft applications have interfaces that drastically change between versions. As for wanting windows users - whilst they may be the target of some distro's they are probably not the aim of the free software community which is (IMHO and experience) to produce software which performs the tasks they need without the shackles of proprietary licences.\r\nI'm with Maddog[2] on this issue of attracting Windows users to Linux. Let's go for the 88% of people who don't have a computer. The <a href=\"http://laptop.org/\">one-laptop-per-child</a> project is a good example of this at work. Try telling those kids that they'll be better off with Vista and Office 2007 - and of course they'll have to learn one of the relatively small number of languages that Office supports first.\r\n\r\n<cite>Photoshop is a prime example in the reverse. It is singly the most annoying graphics application on the planet. All the floating windows are utterly painful. This is a mac based interface, and it pisses off PC users no end. However... most users in the graphic art area are mac users, so to get mac users to buy PCs, you need to write programs that work with their brain.</cite>\r\n\r\nI think you'll find that the application was written without analysis of the way a Mac user thinks. Photoshop users think that way because that's the way Photoshop works. Word users will think in certain ways because that is how they are used to doing it and much of them will come unstuck when Office 2007 comes out.\r\n\r\n<cite>As a windows user who is relatively adept at learning new things, I would only start using linux if 2 things happened:\r\n1. There were free replacement applications that looks better, runs faster, and operates the same (not easier).</cite>\r\n\r\nIf you are using a free software desktop then look and feel is entirely up to you. \"Better\" is a subjective word. This may come as something new to you as a Windows user but free windows managers permit you to chaneg pretty much everything  not just the background, colours and fonts. \r\nRunning faster is really a hardware issue but just in case your experience of Linux is via a Live CD, it does run a lot faster when it's installed :o).\r\nOperates the same? Same as which competing proprietary application? Should K3B (CD burning software) operate the same as Nero, Easy CD creator or Pyro? Most of the free software applications that target common usage areas already operate on a similar basis to proprietary ones. Firefox, Thunderbird, OpenOffice.org all operate on similar principles to other well known apps. The GIMP is just as confusing as Photoshop for a newbie!\r\n\r\n<cite>2. Linux had the ability to run PC games better... sounds stupid, but this is the prime reason linux has little hope of becoming number one. People who work hard, want the option to play as well, without switching operating systems to do so.</cite>\r\n\r\nOkay here's the main error in your argument. You assume that free software exists to compete with proprietary software. It's an understandable mistake because you have grown up in a world where the available software is competing for your money and marketing teams have the biggest budgets. In reality much free software exists because someone - usually the developers - had a need for it and a need for it to be based on freedom. Most of the projects on sourceforge exist to fulfil a need not to compete in a marketplace.\r\n\r\nI agree that the larger - commercially based - distro's are in the business of attracting customers but the software used in their distributions is rarely created with that in mind. Free software looks to attract users not customers. Hence it rarely has a demographic, a target market or an aim to demolish the competition. Free software is about choice. It does not say \"look use me because I'm 100 times better than the one you pay for\"[3], it says \"Here's an alternative  , one that doesn't tie you down and one in which you can play an active part\".\r\n\r\nFree software exists to give us a choice. The proprietary software claims the same but in reality their main aim seems to be the best seller which usually means putting the others out of business.\r\n\r\n[1] Source: Geohive (<a href=\"http://www.geohive.com/charts/charts.php?xml=ec_inet&xsl=ec_inet_top2\">http://www.geohive.com/charts/charts.php?xml=ec_inet&xsl=ec_inet_top2</a>)\r\n[2] At least I think it was him who said it first.\r\n[3] I accept that many FOSS advocates do make statements like this but the software and the developers of it are not really making that statement."

My critique of your ideas is in no way a critique of your person--often the worst of us have the best ideas, and vice versa.\r\n\r\nSecondly, I fail to see how a company as large and complex as Microsoft can have a single \"Redmond way.\"  There are admittedly some very loud dunderheads there, some of whom you certainly picked on in your article, but, as I mentioned, Ye Olde Guarde is on its way out, and they're exploring new business models.  Word on the street is that top Microsoft execs are considering opening some of Vista+1's codebase under a real OSS license.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I hardly think that the \"reputation\" you are trying to seek for OSS is a valid indicator for any company doing a serious cost-benefit analysis.  In the same way that the fact that many people think that Microsoft products are awesome in no way makes it true, if you succeed in building a reputation for free/OSS software as being awesome (which no doubt will happen eventually), it has no actual bearing on the reality of the software as being a particularly good or bad choice, at least from a business standpoint.\r\n\r\nLastly, my comments regarding your blanket statements which have no relationship with fact still stand.  \r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nDrew"
