It is definitely a good idea to start with a Live CD to see what you're getting.\r\nYou are correct in the directory structure being confusing at the start (/, /opt, etc). Sometimes I still have issues with the more obscure ones. But they come around after a while.\r\n\r\n------\r\nlet's all play nice!"

    body: "I have to agree with you that this is quite a good intro. It sums it up quite nicely. You could stress the freedom part a little bit more though, IMHO ;). \r\n\r\nOne tip i give to all new soon-to-be-converts is to listen to this podcast I discovered a little over one year ago: <a href=\"http://www.linuxreality.com/\">linuxreality</a>. It was at that time at episode 2, but I always felt the potential in this one and I have been advising it to people interested in gnu/linux ever since.\r\n\r\nDon't get me wrong, this is not <strong>the</strong> linux podcast. There are a lot of great ones out their and they all deserve your attention (eg. lottalinuxlinks, TLLTS, LugRadio, ... and a lot more). But linuxreality is tailored for new users and in my opinion succeeds in doing that very well. Although I've had the enjoyment of a free system for over 5 years now, it still is capable of teaching me some great tricks that are so easy I simply overlooked them.\r\n\r\nI' m in no way affiliated to this podcast so i don't actually care if you are going to use it or not. It's just a great resource that is there for you to use it. Use it if you want to.\r\n\r\npeace,\r\n\r\nMichael\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    body: "It was a nice into for a beginner to check out the world of Linux. I would caution that looking through rose colored glasses can do more harm than good. \r\n\r\nMost computer users are not super users and only want their computer to work. They don't care how as long as it does. A mention that much of their existing Windows software will be totaly useless when they swap. I know there is Wine but that is a headache all it's own. While your hardware may or may not configure there are still simple things that you grow accustomed to just working in Windows that can be a real pain in the rump to make work. For instance, streaming video / music, 3d acceleration just to name a few. The reality is, something are still just easier for a regular user in Windows. \r\n\r\nDefinitely give Linux a try but don't rush into it blindly thinking you found the holy grail. "

Shopping around is also recommended due to hardware compatibility issues, for this reason I used a dedicated hard drive for the installed linux distro. After 8 months & three distros tried I have finally selected PClinux as my OS. I should also add I have retained Windows as a multi-boot option, whilst using a mounted 3rd hard drive to share documents b/w the two operating systems.'
