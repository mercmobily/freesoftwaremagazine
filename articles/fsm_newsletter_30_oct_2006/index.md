Welcome to another of Free Software Magazine’s fortnightly newsletters, keeping you up to date with us, and all things free software... enjoy!


# General announcements

We have been implementing quite a lot of new features lately—and we have two fun new features for you this fortnight. Firstly, you may have noticed that we have added social bookmarking links at the bottom of each entry. You can use these to add a bookmark to your favourite social bookmarking site. This will help expose new people to the free software movement and help us grow in popularity. We have also added a recent comments panel on the right hand side of the page, which shows the entries that have been commented on most recently and will help to keep you alerted to current discussions.

This week we would like to give a special mention to one of our members, kennyf27, who [](http://www.freesoftwaremagazine.com/node/1798#comment-21008)commented on the poll. He had some really [original and inspired suggestions for alternative names](http://www.freesoftwaremagazine.com/node/1798#comment-21008) for free software. We particularly liked “Laissez-Waire”. Thanks for your comment, Kenny!

# Poll Results—What do you think we should call free software?

The results are in—with “free software” romping home with 54% of the votes. As was raised in the comments, this was not a surprising result—we are, after all, Free Software Magazine, and that means our audience is likely to be biased toward that name. We were more interested in how the other options faired. The 2nd place getter was no surprise either—“open source” on 38%. “FLOSS” (12%), “FOSS” (11%) and “libre software” (11%) came in neck-and-neck. But the real upset was “something else” coming in 3rd on 13%. Clearly there are plenty of our readers that think none of the current options are perfect. There was some great discussion and comments to this effect. Read more [here](http://www.freesoftwaremagazine.com/node/1798#comment) and stay tuned for... 


# This fortnight’s poll

[Do you help friends and family with their GNU/Linux problems?](http://www.freesoftwaremagazine.com/node/1834)

If we do a good job of extolling the virtues of free software to our friends and family, one of them is bound to ask for help sooner or later. Whether it be help with installation of a distro, getting MP3’s working, or getting a troublesome piece of hardware working, let us know how often you help new users out and share some of your experiences.

**Avatars**

Avatars are a great way of expressing your personal identity, whether it be a photo or an image that you feel represents the you you want to be. Read more about avatars [here](http://www.freesoftwaremagazine.com/node/1713). To add an avatar: log in, go to “my account” in the menu on the left, go to the “edit” tab and scroll down to where it says “Upload picture”. Now, hit the browse button, find the image on your computer that you want to upload and go to the bottom of the page and hit the submit button. That’s it; you now have an avatar image.

You can use the links at the bottom of each article to add bookmarks to your favourite social bookmarking site. This will help expose new people to the free software movement and help us grow in popularity.
