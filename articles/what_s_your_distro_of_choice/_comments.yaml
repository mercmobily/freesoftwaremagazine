    body: "I'm still a Debian user, despite my whining about some recent policy decisions. It's the biggest distribution and one of the most purely produced by a community process. I have a strong belief that you should truth-test your values, and using Debian is a matter of practicing what I preach. If community-based production is your primary consideration, it's hard to do better than Debian (though I believe some other distributions such as Fedora are catching up in this respect).\r\n\r\nCommunity-based has a downside in that Debian tends to lack some professional polish, and it's certainly lacking in marketing panache (unless possibly we consider the strength of Debian's \"community-based\" image, which is well-established), but the upside is that it's a very thorough and well thought out system. It also tends to be a little out of date compared to distributions developed on a commercial basis.\r\n\r\nI do also realize that my choice, once made, tends to be pretty permanent. I'm just too lazy to learn how a new distribution works, unless it has an awful lot to offer beyond what Debian can do.\r\n\r\nDebian retains a very strong feeling of community participation, and I think that may be the most important reason for choosing it. At least with Debian, I know that it was designed \"by users for users\".\r\n\r\n"

Fedora is probably excellent for running servers, but on the desktop, you can''t beat Mandriva.'
