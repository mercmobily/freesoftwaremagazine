    body: "The unique perspectives of the various bloggers out there is what makes blogging a valued part of the internet; it should not only be left to the experts. If anyone is allowed to contribute to the blogging world, something beautiful will be created. Wikipedia is a perfect example of this. No one person can know everything about a subject, but with the help of everyone, including the  little people, we can learn something that wouldn't happen without everyone's help.\r\n<hr />\r\nVisit <a href=\"http://www.phileplanet.com/\">Phile Planet</a>\r\n"

    body: "I don't think blogging has done all that much to reduce the process of review or of publication quality.  That you are blogging here on Free Software Magazine instead of on a no-name personal website is like the difference between writing for a \"respected publication\" and scribbling in a private diary.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the bulk of the world has not yet grown accustomed to the new rules for sorting the wheat from the chaff, but they are certainly there. Take a good look at Wikipedia's policies, for example -- they are crafted to maintain the quality of the publication. It's not nearly as haphazard as conventional wisdom has it.\r\n\r\nIt's not like there was <i>ever</i> some magic formula for ensuring that book or traditional periodical publication always maintained high quality. They didn't! There are plenty of lousy printed, hardcover books in this world, I can assure you. \r\n\r\nThe difference perhaps, is that the review process itself is now much more open to review.  And that's probably a move towards higher quality, not lower.\r\n"
