Welcome to another of Free Software Magazine’s fortnightly newsletters. Our newsletters aim to let you know what’s happening on our site and with the magazine. Through these newsletters we’ll keep you up-to-date with new content, competitions, new features and more. Please note: we have lots of exciting developments coming up in the near future, so take a little time to catch up with us. And as always enjoy!


# General announcements

So, if you’ve been to the site in the last few days, you might have noticed that we have a new feature... polls! That’s right, you can now vote on all those free software related issues that are near and dear to your hearts. So get in there and show us what you think! Please remember that you must log in to be able to vote! In other news, we are having a bit of a celebration here at FSM this week - we’ve reached the dizzy heights of pagerank eight in Google’s pageranking system! This means that we’re stepping out with the heavyweight sites... and we owe it all to you. Thanks to all of our contributors, readers and supporters - it’s you guys that make us so popular!

# Reminders

**Comments**

Your comments on articles, issues, and blog entries are very welcome. They provide other readers with insightful suggestions, further information, and the feeling that they are not alone. They also provide our authors with the feeling that they are being heard. Please comment wherever possible and **don’t forget to log in** so that you’ll be in the running to win the [latest book competition](http://www.freesoftwaremagazine.com/blog/1).

**Avatars**

Avatars are a great way of expressing your personal identity, whether it be a photo or an image that you feel represents the you you want to be. Read more about avatars [here](http://www.freesoftwaremagazine.com/node/1713). To add an avatar: log in, go to “my account” in the menu on the left, go to the “edit” tab and scroll down to where it says “Upload picture”. Now, hit the browse button, find the image on your computer that you want to upload and go to the bottom of the page and hit the submit button. That’s it; you now have an avatar image.

**Donate**

As you might know already FSM is a low profit project with all funds raised going back into producing the fine magazine you can download for free.

Think about how much you would normally have to spend buying a magazine of this quality. We provide it for free! If you only gave us $5 per year it would really help us to keep going.

Your donations will help us to continue spreading the word about free software and producing more fantastic issues.
