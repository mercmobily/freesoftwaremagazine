    body: "I have to agree with you on FOSS developers. They need to embrace the others and not repel them just because they are not developing on *nix platform.\r\n\r\nThere are many shareware/freeware apps that are really great and started off life in the Wintel platform. While I develop mostly for Windows and DOS (from C/C++, BASIC, VB to C#, .NET stuffs etc), I also write apps on Palm, PPC, HPC platforms etc. I used to write on *nix platform but that was years back, when X11 libraries was all I had.\r\n\r\nI myself wrote couple of freewares and am currently straddling between Windows and Xubuntu /w XGL. FOSS developers would do much more for the FOSS cause if they were to embrace FOSS developers on the Wintel platform."
