There are other nice clients (I use Kopete on my Unix desktops), but Psi is the only one I can personally vouch for on a wide scale.'

    body: "Interesting project and it's a great use of free software.  How does the support work? I know you have the permision slip/waiver, but do they have your phone number for 24x7 on-call help? :-)  (I know, I know, it's a school.  Business day only.  Still!)\r\n\r\nI like the decisions you made and agree with them, especially using SSL.  Kids can be pretty cruel and I can imagine what would happen if some bright (but cruel) kid figured out how to eavesdrop on conversations.\r\n\r\nFor the logging, did you consider also that the students might be concerned about eavesdropping if the conversations were logged?  I thought of this when I read that part, but as I think further it occurs to me that at my job I assume there is logging of IM but it doesn't really inhibit what I type.  I'm guessing kids would be even less concerned.  Finally, I wonder if there are legalities involved -- any laws or regulations that say you *have* to log conversations?  (If not now I wouldn't be surprised to see them in the future.)\r\n\r\n----\r\n<a href=\"http://www.movingtofreedom.org/\" title=\"Freedom is on the March!\">http://www.movingtofreedom.org/</a>\r\nNow playing: <a href=\"http://www.movingtofreedom.org/2006/09/03/ralph-waldo-emerson/\">Ralph Waldo Emerson</a>\r\n"

More like Psi, which I would guess is a bit to geeky for ordinary schools.\r\n\r\nIt also have features like white bord and to play games.  And with a geeky dad that can add some more modules, who knows what can be done ;-)\r\n\r\nHave a look at <a http:\"http://hem.fyristorg.com/matben/index.html\">Coccinella's homepage</a> for more information."
