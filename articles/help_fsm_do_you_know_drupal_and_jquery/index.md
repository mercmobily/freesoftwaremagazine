Dear readers,

We are developing a new, funky Karma module for Drupal. We are doing it for Free Software Magazine, although we will release it under the GPL.

However, we need help. Tony, who is programming the module, doesn't know anything about Javascript and the module really needs to have some basic Ajax abilities. Basically, users need to be able to rate a comment by picking an item in a select box, and the server needs to receive the information without reloading the page.

This is a request for help to the community: if you know Drupal and JQuery (or, even just JQuery should be enough!), please contact Tony (t.mobily and then AT and then freesoftwaremagazine.com) and offer him some help!

Thanks in advance,

Admin.
