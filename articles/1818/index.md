FAVE is an event in the UK for people who are interested in free audio and video software on Linux and other platforms. I'm helping to put together the second annual event, which will feature talks, workshops and performances by free software artists and developers.

Entry costs Â£5 and registration in advance is required, via the FAVE website at [www.fave.org.uk](http://www.fave.org.uk/) This is just to help us cover the venue costs, and give us an idea of the number of people coming.

If any FSM readers would like to help out with publicity, or on the day itself, they would be most welcome.
