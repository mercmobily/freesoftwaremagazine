Here’s some interesting news. Microsoft is reportedly [opening up the file formats](http://news.com.com/2061-11199_3-5966892.html?part=rss&tag=5966892&subj=news) of its new suite, promising folks that they won’t be locked into a proprietary file format. The move reminds me strongly of Adobe’s decisions with its .PDF format. Their openness helped make PDF files almost ubiquitous. What I’m wondering is whether open MS Office formats will affect the adoption rate of OO. Will Microsoft’s new position make it easier for "moderates" in the Free Software Movement to continue using MS Office?
