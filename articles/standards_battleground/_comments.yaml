    body: "I worked on MPE while at HP, and I can assure you that MPE used and still uses ASCII.  It did have the capability to understand EBCDIC (I believe that the FCOPY utility had an option to translate between ASCII and EBCDIC) but the normal character set was most definitely ASCII.\r\n\r\nTake it from someone who coded things like\r\n<CODE> &nbsp; &nbsp; SCAN (something) UNTIL %6412</CODE>\r\nor\r\n<CODE> &nbsp; &nbsp; SCAN (something) WHILE %6440</CODE>\r\nmany many times -- it really was ASCII."
