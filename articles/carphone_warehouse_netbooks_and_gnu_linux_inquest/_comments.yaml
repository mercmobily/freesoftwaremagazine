    body: "I've been doing Linux installs for friends, family and different non-profits for a few years and whenever I've give Live CDs to people who are new to Gnu-Linux over 3/4 choose KDE.\r\nI try to make it as recognizable as possible to them and that means making it look like Windows. Heck, I even give them the XP tacky blue if they so desire.\r\nIts about making it easier for the user.\r\n\r\nAs someone who uses KDE, E17, XCFE, Gnome, XP, Vista and OS10 during the day, GUIs means little to me. Most of my desktops consists of the same wallpaper of my kids, have 6 icons and a disappearing taskbar so they often look identical but I work with enough Gnu-Linux newbies that I have gotten to know what makes the feel more confortable and what stumps them.\r\n\r\nGnu-Linux desktops are not harder to use that Mac. Different is just different and that enough is barrier to switching over and I think that KDE would make it easier for transitioning people over.\r\n\r\nThis isnt about which desktop is 'better', this is about which desktop can make the switch easier, which desktop can look like the Windows they are used to. Yes, even Vista.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat I would like to see from distros and even software is easy modes like the netbooks have.\r\nGive the full monty OS but also have an easy mode for newbies to transition them easily to Gnu-Linux (I know a lot of Acer and Dell users who just use the easy mode. its enough for them). They can then stay with it or eventually see what the whole OS has to offer.\r\n\r\nImagine the same for software where a program like Audacity and KDEnlive has an easy mode for people who just want to do the basic 5 most used features like the fruit company does but one click allows those who want more to use the full program."

    body: "> Despite what my colleague Ryan Cartwright has said ... Economic circumstances may be propitious but, given user resistance, these are not the conditions for the perfect Linux storm\r\n\r\n\r\nHmm I'm not so sure we disagree here. I didn't say that the economic downturn would provide conditions for any kind of \"Linux storm\". I actually said ..\r\n\r\n> I also suspect that desktops (and laptops, net-books etc.) running a free operating systems would have increased this year anyway. It seems to have been heading that way despite any economic downturn. ... I see no reason why a change in economic circumstances would alter that trend.\r\n\r\nMy argument was actually that take-up of free software is on the increase year-on-year and an economic downturn would *not* prove a catalyst to speed that up.\r\n\r\nAs for vendors treating users like new-born kittens : yes they do and will continue to do so until (unless?) those customers vote with their feet. There has always been a section of the IT sales industry which wants to commodotise the computer. Those who want to turn it into a turnkey device akin to a TV (which is ironic seeing as most TVs these days have a confusing array of options which are mostly left untouched). As long as the consumer is prepared to be thus treated the vendor will be happy to oblige. But none of that means that Windows is the answer. Microsoft is doing itself no favours with regards ease-of-use. UAC, DRM and indeed the entire mess that is Vista has been a real shot in the foot for those in Redmond. For the first time significant numbers of Windows users are beginning to question the wisdom of using that particular OS. And that's not just the tech-literate ones but the ones who bought their first ever PC from PC-World and didn't even realise it came with Windows (or that there was an alternative).\r\n\r\nI've said this before but the days of paid-for, restrictive software licencing are numbered. How long will it take before we see a real change? I don't know. It won't be very soon but the slip has started. If vendors choose to continue to patronise their customers and waste their resources on archaic licencing that will eventually be their downfall as their competitors start to make real savings and real effect by treating their customers as people.\r\n\r\ncheers  \r\nRyan\r\n--\r\nEquitas IT Solutions - fairness, quality, freedom\r\nhttp://www.equitasit.co.uk"

    body: "The tabbed interface on the Xandros-based Eee PC makes it practically unusable, IMHO. (Really, Fisher Price should feel insulted by the comparison).\r\n\r\nI think sometimes that developers go _too far_ in trying to \"dumb down\" the interface. After all, the dumbest, easiest-to-use interface is that of a brick. It's also the most pointless!\r\n\r\nThe value of a UI is not just that it's easy, but that it's easy to do _what you want to do_.\r\n\r\nI can do with my Eee PC exactly what the manufacturer wanted me to be able to do with it, but that isn't much. Nor is it what I want the machine for (it's not even close).\r\n\r\nFor example, I can't even run gvim on it as it stands now.\r\n\r\nMy solution of course, will be to reinstall the O/S and put something with a (fairly) conventional KDE front end on it. But this will take some time.\r\n\r\nJust getting a terminal emulator is a major pain in the tabbed interface. I go to the \"work\" tab, click on \"File Manager\", select \"View->Show All Files Systems\" (Duh), Browse \"up\", click on \"All File Systems\", then browse down to /usr/bin, find \"xterm\" and double-click! \"Piece of cake\". Seriously, it's that annoying.\r\n"

    body: "Well, I won't argue... having only a few buttons to worry about is good. Especially when the screen and keyboard are small. A \"super PDA\" is exactly how I see the Eee. It's just that for my needs, the buttons provided are the _wrong_ buttons. `:-)`\r\n\r\nAnd of course, with desktop icons and launcher bar, KDE can give you very nearly the same level of simplicity as the Eee's tabbed interface, but with the flexibility to _pick_ which buttons you want (and even change them from time to time as needed).\r\n\r\nIn fact, I really think the tabs would be fine, if I could just figure out how to add new application buttons and/or tabs to them. It's not being able to edit them that is frustrating. I suppose there's probably a configuration file in `/etc` somewhere, though I haven't gone looking for it.\r\n\r\n> In the standard interface Ctrl+Shift+T gives you a terminal\r\n\r\n_Now_ I find out. Thanks for the tip! `:-D`\r\n\r\nWhat I can't figure out now is what hotkey I keep hitting that throws the keyboard into kinput/Kanji mode. Whatever it is, it doesn't work the way my desktop system does (on which I use canna and kinput2-canna for Japanese text). I mean it's nice that I can type kanji, but most of the time, I still want \"romaji\" (Western characters). It's so frustrating, because the only way I know to stop it is to launch a new terminal. `:-/`\r\n\r\nI'm figuring it'll all change when I reinstall the O/S, though."

    body: "You write a lot about the opportunities and chances that \"Linux\" has/had but to whom are you referring? There is no central body that markets GNU/Linux so who exactly has missed these opportunities?\r\n\r\nThe distributions ? -- They don't make the hardware and the people that do have grown up on a diet of Microsoft OEM discounts, it will take them a while to take huge risks. Make no mistake Asus' aim with the EeePC was to raise the profile of Asus -- nobody else. Microsoft saw what was happening and stepped in to woo Asus: Asus have revealed their nature but you know what? That's fine. Canonical have launched the netbook version of Ubuntu and -- from what I can tell -- are keen to work with companies like Asus & Dell.\r\n\r\nThe community ? -- We can't agree on what browser we should specify as default -- let alone how to market a distribution. And you know what: we shouldn't have to -- that's the point. Free software works best when it's not embroiled in a beauty contest.\r\n\r\nSo let's stop referring to \"Linux\" as an entity/body/company that can make such decisions and can relate to outdated concepts like marketing and OEM licencing. If \"Joe Doe\" doesn't care about what OS he uses that's up to him -- and it always should be. Free software is *not* about money, it's not about making money from \"products\", it's not about selling, it's not about reacting to \"market\" forces and it's not about telling customers what they should be thinking. It's about giving Joe an option, it's about giving him real choices and power over his computer and it doesn't fit into a 20th century model of software.\r\n\r\nThose Asus netbooks running an 8 year old operating system can be upgraded quite simply to a more modern one you know -- and at zero cost. Also have you noticed that as soon as Windows got involved the \"lightweight\" and \"handy\" netbooks started getting faster CPUs, more RAM, increased storage space and a higher price tag. Why would Joe Doe spend £300 on a netbook when he can buy a £360 notebook? He may be too lazy to learn a new OS but I'll bet the salesperson will still be able to direct him towards a Vista laptop for an extra £60. Asus hit on a niche in the market and then moved the EeePC out of it. It is -- to my mind -- much more useful as a 1kg super-PDA than as a 2kg mini-notebook.\r\n\r\ncheers  \r\nRyan  \r\n- -  \r\nEquitas IT Solutions - fairness, quality, freedom\r\nhttp://www.equitasit.co.uk"

    body: "I have to agree on the significance of the market niche that the early \"netbook\" computers struck. As a matter of fact, I do not and will not carry a \"conventional\" PDA, and I don't like \"smart phones\". The reason is simple: I can't stand the crippled interface. I want something with a _keyboard_.\r\n\r\nI also want something fully programmable, and that's where GNU/Linux takes the cake.\r\n\r\nThe point is, as I said in my previous post: no manufacturer out there really understands what _I_ need from my \"PDA\". I don't really even want them to. I want to have the freedom to _make_ it do what I want.\r\n\r\nI might use a laptop, but it would be overkill for my needs: too heavy, too fragile, and too expensive. I don't want to be burdened by one (neither physically due to the weight or psychologically due to the expense and fragility).\r\n\r\nWhere the netbooks need to go is _downscale_ integration with PDA-like devices: inclusion of camera and phone features, and increased battery life to facilitate daily and travel use without relying so heavily on charging. This way you could opt to carry a netbook _instead_ of carrying several separate devices.\r\n\r\nYou know what we're looking for here is a _tricorder_. I don't know why the manufacturers can't see that -- did they not watch Star Trek when they were kids or what? I'm pretty happy with my _communicator_. Phasers will have to wait, I suppose. :-) (Oh wait, I _have_ got that laser pointer keychain...).\r\n"
