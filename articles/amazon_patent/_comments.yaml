    body: "This is certainly one of the more informative and intersting articles I've read on software patents.  Despite being in the field, I never really knew the background of the issue.  Thanks!  Maybe your readers would benefit from a free patent searchign site I run:  <a href=\"http://www.freepatentsonline.com\">FreePatentsOnline</a>.  Great way to find examples of interesting patents, and unlike at the USPTO, you can access PDF versions of the patents.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nJames Ryley, Ph.D.\r\nwww.freepatentsonline.com\r\n"
