Not only is the main heroine a brain with a artificial body.\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n <li>\r\n  The first Gits movie is about an elite hacker (a programm really) that ghost hacks people (hacking their cyberbrains) and constructs a new identiy in them to furthen their goals. The poor sods believe they *are* the puppet-master, while they're just a puppet.\r\n </li>\r\n <li>\r\n  Practically the complete first season (SAC 1) is about a phenomenon called \"Laughing man\", where various people adopt that \"identiy\" to implement their agendas.\r\n </li>\r\n <li>\r\n  The complete second series (SAC 2) is about a phenomenon like the laughing man, (emerging) \"The particularist Eleven\". It triggers subversive plotting behavior in individuals. However, it's not that they've been plainly ghost hacked, but that the combination of a common virus and having read a particular text changes their personality.\r\n </li>\r\n <li>\r\n  One episode of the first season is about a robotic engineer who dies of a terminal illness. A colleque puts his brain into one of the battle bots he so loved to create, and he then goes on a rampage which almost concludes in him killing his parents. Altough his actions are violent, it's theorized by the Major (who burns out his brain) that they're motivated by pride and love. \r\n </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nFor below quote I'd have included a reference to <a href=\"http://www.accelerando.org/\">accelerando</a> by <a href=\"http://www.antipope.org/charlie/fiction/faq.html\">Charles Stross</a>.\r\n\r\n<cite>\r\nAs I become reliant on this kind of extended identity, losing my Internet connection is like a lobotomyâ€”I feel\r\nan almost physical sense of loss as a portion of my intelligence is removed.

Thus remind me that I've never been disconnected for quite some years now.\r\n\r\nI got my first internet connection at 16. I have 23 now, and I never ever been without internet since then. Which make me feel like a ghost in the net without a real identity. In fact I would love to be in the internet just like the Major in the GitS Innocence.\r\n\r\nAnyway in the 2004-2005 school year, I've been studying far away from home and I was quite forced to quit my internet identity. So I just became a \"real\" person. I didn't know this so well before, so I just \"created\" a new personnal identity, as you do when you are creating your avatar, or thinking about your \"pseudonyme\" on the internet. And I was quite confortable with this, I was enjoying it. \r\n\r\nJust like being yourself. It was an huge thing, just like feeling the real life. It's not like the virtual world you know.\r\n\r\nNow I quit the \"far away\" school for one next to my home. And I feel like I lost my real identity again.\r\n\r\nSo this brings a question that you might answer: what is the best to have. An identity that may be you dislike in the real world, but that is real for sure. Or have an ideal identity, personnalised, that you created, but that is not so real.\r\n\r\nI think it could be dangerous for people like me if they fail to love the real world. In fact I do so much love everything in the world that I could not quit the real life, but not everyone feel the same.\r\n\r\nLeibowitz"

Batou as you may have seen watching the series doesn''t see that in her. He only can see the human within(Anyone who has watched the show knows that he has a big crush on her)lol Also I would like to point out that her body is more than an android body. It''s designed to replicate every aspect of her originial one so the brain is fooled into thinking it''s in her original body. She eat''s she sleeps, and does all the things that make a human...well human. Her body also has no plastic or silicon. If it where real I''d say it would be a miricle of nanobiotechnology because her skin, eyes, tounge and muscle are engineered organic tissue encorperated into a titanium skeletal structure.  She operates the body no differently than anyone else uses their natural ones. It works from direct neural control interfaced at the base of her protective braincase. So in regards to the difference between which is her. I think they both are. Each one representing a different part of her personality. If you look hard I''m sure you''ll notice that the eye and hair color on her Avatar body "Chroma" are reversed from her physical one. Just some info to think on a bit.

In a way, it makes you more conscious about many things.\r\nFor me, i've found my Second Life avatar is regarded as attractive and often find myself at the receiving end of friendly affection such as hugs, something that is somehow harder to accomplish in the real world; but realising that I am a working man whom doesn't have a lot of spare time to spend outdoors enjoying life with it's many opportunities, I myself am the architect of my own lack of the things I experience when driving an avatar.\r\n\r\nYou could say that living an online life erodes your offline life. This is true to an extent, if you lack moderation and can't pry your fingers off that mouse and keyboard for more than half a day at a time you are indeed the architect of your own demise.\r\nWhich in turn is part of becoming more conscious: You (should) learn that there is more to life and that you'll have to reach for the high fruits yourself, they won't come down to you by themselves.\r\n\r\nFor me the virtual reality of Second Life and the many other tools The Internet offer me is an extension of myself and my means of communicating with a part of my group of friends, but it is by no means a replacement of my life in the real world where I live and breathe, and work on my future.\r\nAs such, i'm currently unable to fully imagine how it would be to have my mind reside permanently in an artificial body such as Kusanagi's own cyborg body and live with things such as the regular maintenance required to it's mechanical components and the unavoidable risks of unpredictable faillure.\r\nCould you live with the knowledge your original physical body has died of disease, accident or old age, even see it lying lifeless in a coffin while your mind as your very essence remains 'alive' in another body?\r\nCould you separate yourself from that which you regarded as being 'you'?\r\nBut who knows how this world of ours will change and how much? it will be interesting to say the least to see further developments on technology such as brain interfaces.\r\n\r\nAs a last side note, through online social gatherings and gaming activities I have made many friends I hope I may enjoy the presence of for the rest of my life, which apart from the massive available knowledge online feels very enriching and humbling at the same time.\r\n\r\nThank you for this article."

As well as being able to communicate with others via internal cellular cybercom. From first person point of view it wouldn't \"feel\" any different. The body is designed to fool the person's brain into thinking it is still in it's own body. In order to do that it has to replicate the natural bodies'functions. I think people are too attached to their bodies. The body is not who the person is. The body itself is basically an interface so you can experience the physical world around you. It's a naturally made \"Shell\". Her body by comparison is better. It doesn't age or get sick and it's more durable. The regular maintanence that she has to go through really is comparable with visiting the Doctor for a checkup. So that isn't really a big deal. Although if anyone is familiar with the show's second season one of the characters uses a \"maintanence free body\". It's actually able to regenerate damaged tissue. All in all like the world of Ghost in the Shell you will have some people for enhancement and some that are against it. In the end people usually lean toward technology as they learn that it's not going to hurt them or change them or who they are. If a person uses a prosthetic heart does that make them a different person? I think we know the answer to that. "

    created: '1173868369'
    body: "If your avatar falls do you feel it?\r\n\r\n No, really.  Think about it.  Focusing on what your ( or someone else's ) avatar IS to you ( or them ) isn't really the point.  Mr. Hancock mentions driving a car as an example of a form of 'virtual reality' & likens it to the experience he's had w/ his ( & other's ) avatars.  While that's fine in the context of his article, I think its important to remember a few facts.  The 'driving a car' thing has an understandable application NOW, while we can ( & still do ) drive cars.  But if the price of fuel keeps rising, at some point the 'average' person will lose the economic ability to drive.  Shortly afterward, his use of that analogy will also lose its 'power,' its ability to connect the reader w/ the experience he's describing thru his analogy.  In other words, he's using a relative 'known' factor to describe something that he KNOWS many people haven't thought of that way.\r\n ( Actually, not a bad choice, considering his apparent goal. )  The problem is this; all too often we humans think that because some of us THINK of a certain thing, that its possible, or acceptable, or even 'good,' from someone's ( limited ) point of view.  Reality is often different.  An example is the current debate regarding violence in entertainment.  Many feel that because its 'fiction,' that makes it all right, nothing to worry about, just ignore it; bla, bla bla,.  But too many medical studies are showing that it has REAL EFFECTS on REAL PEOPLE.  Avatars are similar, as Mr Hancock pointed out. People begin to relate to them AS IF THEY ARE THE REAL PERSON!  Now, I don't know about you, but I've made a conscious effort to first, ignore other people's avatars, & second, to avoid using one myself.  Don't get the wrong idea, I HAVE tried out one or two, just to be sure that I've got a clear understanding of what avatars do, or can do, in some circumstances.  Some free online email suppliers provide some limited abilities to customize a personal avatar for their clients.  One of my first ones turned out pretty good I thought.  I even had my wife review it, because Hey!, who knows me better, right?  So she looks at it & says Hey! It looks like you! ( In a cartoony way, of course.)  I thought about it for awhile & I came to this conclusion.  While many people use fantasy/fantastical or mythological or even 'iconic' types of avatars, they are doing so in a deliberate attempt to 'project' an image that is NOT 'realistic.'  If you are using an avatar(s), do you do so as actual extension of who/what you REALLY are? ( Like some illustrated in the article. )  Or is this another one of those immature, irrational, or even narcissistic attempts to try convey an imaginary or 'wishful' image to people who, due to factual circumstances, don't have the ability to 'discern' what you're really like?\r\nIn other words, are avatars being used to project a realistic image of the kind of person that they are representing, or is their use more as a mask?  Don't think that this is not a serious subject, or a serious question.  It doesn't take much research to find out that there are serious issues involved whenever humans start to put on masks.  Even the 'cartoon superheros' who wear masks ( disguises ) to 'protect' their 'secret identities' have come under some very serious discussion by the psychological research community.  There are very real problems w/ masks, disguises, 'secret identities,' and yes, even avatars.  People have been known to 'become' someone else while wearing/hiding behind an image that they know misrepresents who or what they really are.  Mr Hancock touched the edges of the debate when he mentioned \"some kind of falsehood.\"  Its not about you using an avatar that deliberately misrepresents who you are.  Its about the ( psychological ) problems that we humans begin to experience whenever we lose touch with the reality of a situation.\r\nAnd that's the connection to open-source as opposed to closed-source software.  In EVERY instance, closed-source is about those ones who have lost touch w/ the reality of the situation.  ONLY open-source can provide the REAL, CLEAR, and necessary connection between the software provider and the one(s) that the software was actually written FOR!  Anything else is just more farce."
