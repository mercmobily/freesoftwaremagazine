ever wanted to watch a flash video but don't want to use adobe's proprietary software? I know how you feel. But now you can with a plugin for Totem movie player that allows you to browse and play You tube videos without any flash plugin. 
here is the link to the article that will describe how to do this.

P.S. If someone could please clue me in on how to do anchored links in a post it would make them a lot more useful.
