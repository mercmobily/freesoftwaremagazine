    body: "<strong>From</strong>: Floyd Wilde \r\n<strong>Url</strong>: \r\n<strong>Date</strong>: 2005-06-27\r\n<strong>Subject:</strong> Neural Interfaces\r\n\r\n\r\nDon't get so picky on details, what the author is saying is a lot of stuff has happened in the past 30 years whats next?  This article is more imaginative than technical, and I'm glad to read it.  Everthing to do with technology is technical, I know, but it's nice to forget about specs and stop reading documentation once and a while and think about science fiction.  Where is Free Software nowadays in the landscape of cyberpunk/sci fi or whaterver we're calling it now?  I am sure it has it's place.   We have seen the neural interface in sci fi for many years now, people have been jacking in to little ports implanted in the back of their necks since the early 80's AFAIK?  I wonder what a neural interface would be like also, and wonder how far off from reality it really is.  It's very valid to consider Free Software in the speculation, would you want to run a propreitary app inside your skull?  Not me pal.  Not that Free Software would be without it's dangers when loaded into the ole soft machine. Oh no my brain core dumped! \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn a seperate thought I also think Free Software is/will play a big role in AI evolution.  I mean could an AI really be an AI if it were not Free? If an AI program was able to approach sentience, would it demand to be released under the  GPL? "
