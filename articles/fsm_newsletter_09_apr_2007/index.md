Hi everybody, and welcome to another fortnightly edition of Free Software Magazine’s newsletter; keeping you up to date in the world of free software! And do we have some good stuff for you guys this fortnight!


# General announcements

Firstly, we have just released Issue 17, and it is packed full of good things for your reading pleasure. Highly recommended, even if we do say so ourselves! Secondly, we are finally running our web site using Drupal 5! Not noticing anything different? Excellent. That means everything is working as planned. We rewrote our article management system, and are about to release it under the GPL as a Drupal module. This means that we are about to roll out several exciting features, which we have been hoarding up until the new site was out. So... stay tuned!

# Poll Results—What is the primary way in which you contribute to free software?

The results of this poll were pretty clear cut! 70% of our readers contribute to the free software movement by advocating the use of free software by teaching and installing it for people. A big thank you to you all! This was followed by 12% of you contribute by writing code and releasing it under a free license, 6% of you contribute financially to free software, 6% of you don’t contribute at all, 3% of you write documentation, and 4% do something other. What an excellent community we have! Read more [here](http://www.freesoftwaremagazine.com/polls/what_is_the_primary_way_in_which_you_contribute_to_free_software) and stay tuned for...


# This fortnight’s poll

[Would you install GNU/Linux on your grandmother’s computer?](http://www.freesoftwaremagazine.com/polls/would_you_install_gnu_linux_for_your_grandmother)

So, would you install a GNU/Linux distro for your grandmother (or other computer illiterate person (...not that we intend to suggest that grandmothers aren’t computer literate. We’re sure there are plenty of computer savvy grandmothers out there. In fact, there would be more and more every day. Please post a comment if you are tech-savvy granny.)) if you could? What distro would it be if you did? Why wouldn’t you install it if you couldn’t? Let us know your thoughts.


# Reminders

**Comments**

Your comments on articles, issues, and blog entries are very welcome. They provide other readers with insightful suggestions, further information, and the feeling that they are not alone. They also provide our authors with the feeling that they are being heard. Please comment wherever possible and **don’t forget to log in** so that you’ll be in the running to win the [latest book competition](http://www.freesoftwaremagazine.com/blog/1).

**Avatars**

Avatars are a great way of expressing your personal identity, whether it be a photo or an image that you feel represents the you you want to be. Read more about avatars [here](http://www.freesoftwaremagazine.com/node/1713). To add an avatar: log in, go to “my account” in the menu on the left, go to the “edit” tab and scroll down to where it says “Upload picture”. Now, hit the browse button, find the image on your computer that you want to upload and go to the bottom of the page and hit the submit button. That’s it; you now have an avatar image.

**Donate**

As you might know already FSM is a low profit project with all funds raised going back into producing the fine magazine you can download for free.

Think about how much you would normally have to spend buying a magazine of this quality. We provide it for free!

Your donations will help us to continue spreading the word about free software and producing more fantastic issues.
