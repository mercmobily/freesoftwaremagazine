I mean it.\r\n\r\nIt probably shows, that I'm not really a natural blogger, though. I tend to write, you know, <i>epics</i>.  My Mom still ribs me about my long-windedness.\r\n\r\nBut I digress. The move to Drupal is a big improvement, and I find both the front and back end of this site much more navigable as a result."
