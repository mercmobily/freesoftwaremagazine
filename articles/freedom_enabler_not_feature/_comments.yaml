    body: "This is a good post with some well made points. In my experience people are inherently lazy and will take the path of least resistance (or more correctly _perceived_ least resistance) to what they want to achieve.\r\n\r\nThose with less technical acumen will neatly hide behind \"not knowing what they are doing\" rather than make a considered decision. Those with it will often plumb for what they are familiar with -- regardless of whether it is the best fit to the problem. The thing is that if you decide upon a proprietary solution, it's often harder to reverse that later.\r\n\r\nAs you say in the end time will bring freedom more into the fore -- particularly if those with monopolies continue to abuse them (as is the nature of monopolists). That it will take time is fine by me, it's taken some years to get this far but it's been worth it and we're in no hurry really.\r\n\r\ncheers  \r\nRyan"
