    body: "I don't think it's necessarily <em>economic</em> payback that makes the difference.\r\n\r\nSome of the worst burnout I've ever experienced was from jobs that paid very well but left me feeling spiritually and intellectually void. For example, I couldn't really complain about the pay in telephone tech support (it was the most lucrative option I had at the time).\r\n\r\nBut, what drove me crazy was spending two hours a day in a car, commuting to and from the job, and then spending eight hours with nothing but people's trivial problems with their ink jet printers in my head. In fact, these things stuck in my head so much, that I would find myself talking about printers after I got home. Which was just too much—something like 10-12 hours a day with my brain ‘stuck in first gear’!\r\n\r\nIn fact, the pay really contributed to the burnout, because, as a provider for my family, I felt very guilty about leaving a good paycheck behind, even when the job itself is killing me.\r\n\r\nI think I lasted about four months in that job. After I quit, I took up two part time jobs doing manual labor, which doesn't fill your head with trivia, so you're free to use it for your own purposes (and I always have something to think about). On the other hand, I didn't keep those jobs that long, either, as I finally got a professional break some months later (ironically, the increased upper body strength from three months of package handling turned out to be useful in the professional job, since my first task was to move the office out of my employer's home into a professional building!).\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I don't think there's one metric for what everybody is looking for in terms of meaning. For me, intellectual stimulation for its own sake and a certain amount of recognition is the primary motivator. Money, beyond a basic living, is secondary for me (though it can be regarded as one form of recognition).\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, of course, if you <em>aren't</em> making a basic living, then not being paid can leave you feeling pretty disgusted, especially if you went in with the expectation of income.\r\n"

    body: 'I think I''m burned out right now because of my personal failure - I''m a heavy procrastinator. It simply means not doing some task, because I convince myself I must be doing something more important, and naturally I get very little done. There is no way you can be a heavy procrastinator like me and not get into trouble. When I get into trouble, I get stressed out and easily frustrated, and if the environment isn''t in "support mode" and you have to keep on working missing deadline after deadline but still need to keep going - you''ll probably burnout too. Well, there is an obvious cure - do the work, and get happy - right? Anyone else?'
