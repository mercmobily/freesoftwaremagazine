This includes some servers (which are not public-facing). \r\n\r\nI have encountered some packages for which an upgrade breaks something: fglrx for one. But that's more to do with me not reading the release notes than anything else.\r\n\r\ncheers\r\nRyan\r\n--\r\nEquitas IT Solutions - fairness, quality, freedom\r\nhttp://www.equitasit.co.uk"
