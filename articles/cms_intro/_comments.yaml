    body: "Thank you for this interesting introduction to the WCMS. I was however surprized about the fact that some very important solutions were not mentionned.\r\n\r\nThe most important one is TYPO3, which has thousands of users, including large compagnies like Serge Dassault and political institutions like the European parliament and a very living community. The wealth of extensions developped for this WCMS is a striking proof of its wide audience.\r\n\r\nAlthough OpenCMS is more a framework which is appropriate if someone wants to develop a WCMS closely adapted to its needs (and tightly integrated with J2EE applications), TYPO3 is an entreprise WCMS based on a core completed by the (existing) extensions needed in order to satisfy the need of a client.\r\n\r\nI was also surprized to see that XOOPS was not even mentionned, while it is a very popular tool.\r\n\r\nAnother WCMS which would have been worth mentionning is the french SPIP. This editorial WCMS also has a very living community, thousands of users and it is, at least in french, very well documented. One of its interesting aspects is that it is used both by publishers (especially \"Le Monde Diplomatique\", a prestigious publication, the french government and countless non profit organizations and associations).\r\n\r\nBest regards\r\n\r\nMarie-NoÃƒÂ«lle Baechler\r\nBelmont-sur-lausanne / Suisse\r\n"
