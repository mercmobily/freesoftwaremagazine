    body: "The biggest issue I had with Wave was that it did not have an option to send an e-mail to you when a reply or comment had been made in an existing Wave, nor did people have the option of sending any form of notice to you that they'd included you in a Wave they'd created. \r\n\r\nThus you were stuck with having to check it all the time. To me this was an unnecessary restriction and one which made no sense.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, people were not keen on opening a gmail address so they could participate. \r\n\r\nOne option would have been to allow people merely to subscribe to Wave.\r\n\r\nI hope Apache take this on board and are able to reintroduce the idea with some of the changes I believe would increase uptake and make Wave more user friendly."
