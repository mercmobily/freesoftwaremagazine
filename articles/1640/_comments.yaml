    body: 'The idea may sound good, but I think that you will run into a network slowdown. If you have evry computer trying to search the network for the same things it will be inherently redundant. I think the central index idea is better. Just think, if at all times your computer network was being cralled with various spiders looking for content; just imagine the security concerns. Distributed things are good, but they do have their tradeoffs.'

Yes there would be some security concerns...but how big will they be?  I think that if you have 10 PCs in a cloud index the same item, and 9 give one answer and 1 gives another, you toss the odd data out.\r\n\r\nMartin Tibbitts"
