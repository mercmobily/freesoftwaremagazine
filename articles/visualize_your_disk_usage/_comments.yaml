    body: "Nice article, but just one thing:\r\n\r\nIt's a pitty that the adjective 'free' is used in this article a bit confusing. Free Software Magazine was always keen to use that term in reference to freedom, not price. I think this is an important distinction, especially when talking about a freeware product and a free software tool. \r\nJust a little remark."

I personally use both Linux and Windows desktops, and I''m probably not the only one.  I haven''t tried either utility in ReactOS or Wine, but in theory, it should work.'
