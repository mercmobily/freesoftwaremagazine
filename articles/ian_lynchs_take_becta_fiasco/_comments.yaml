    body: "\"The required deliverable outcomes reflect current available provision. Schoolforge UK/TLMâ€™s starting points are so far in advance of the targets set in the spec it shows complete lack of understanding of where things are at. \"\r\n\r\nYes, I am afraid, this is too often the case. As a beneficiary of what gets produced with funding by the likes of Becta, my opinion is that what gets mostly produced with a Becta-type of funding is something  that has no impact whatsoever (doesn't get to be used by more than 50 persons) and typically dies within 3 years. Funding typically covers the development of brand new project designed from scratch, never the support of projects that already got out of the ground by their own effort.\r\n\r\nThis is in some part due to the fact that these institution are used to award research funding. In that context, a research is being carried on. A report is being written. Two or three years after the funding has been awarded all deliverable have been submitted. They are made available in some form or another (pdf, book, presentations, etc.). End of the cycle. The researcher will apply for another grant, proposing to explore new ideas. \r\n\r\nWith software, CMS, or web services a completely different model is required.\r\n\r\nI am afraid, most persons working in education institutions (government funded or universities) have little or no knowledge of software development processes (I include there CMS and other solutions). They are a lot more familiar with the discourse of a bunch of consultants used to write research reports than with the one of developers with proven records.\r\n\r\nAs an academic researcher I have on many occasions be exposed to the same frustration expressed in this article. It was a piece of cake to obtain funding for some obscure research that nobody cared about, that would have limited impact on the field, and that was anyway unacceptably compromised by the use of suboptimal data analysis techniques predominantly used in the field. It was seemingly impossible to obtain any funding to help build a better infrastructure that would have contributed to better quality research in the field at large. On typical research proposals, informed comments were received and decisions on the whole perceived as rather fair. On the second type of proposal, I always felt that what had got me miss out was not the poorness of my ideas but the abysmal lack of knowledge that transpired in the comments made by the reviewers. Lack of knowledge of what was already available and what had been technically possible for a few years. \r\n\r\nFor these blunders to stop to repeat, it is important to take the time to educate the members of the education institutions. I don't expect, however, such attempts to be very successful. It is quite difficult to understand the value of a few points being made for a person with no development experience whatsoever. A better approach is perhaps to accept that big institutions are resistant to shift/change and that new ways of supporting worthy projects need to be found."
