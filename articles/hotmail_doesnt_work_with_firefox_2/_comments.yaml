I'd like to get an account from MacOS X users, for a laugh.\r\n\r\nThe last email I got from them was that they were glad I could fix my problem (not saying anything about Linux being locked out), and they AGAIN tried to make me configure Outlook/Outlook Express to access Hotmail.\r\n\r\nThe 'satisfaction inquiry' I got from them was well filled by yours truly, with my appreciation of their service. I don't need to say that most questions got a 'not satisfactory at all' appreciation from me.\r\n\r\nAnyway, since the 'Full' version renders worse than the 'Classic' version (with misaligned blocks all over the place, and very slowly), I'll stick to Classic.\r\n\r\nIt's not as if I use it much, outside of trapping spam and some other accounts I forgot to migrate...\r\n\r\n---\r\nA computer is like air conditioning: it becomes useless when you open windows."

    body: 'I run Iceweasel 2.0 on Debian "Etch." Just for fun, I went and opened a hotmail account. With the default user agent string, everything worked okay except for the "full" version was blocked. I then changed the user agent to Firefox 2.0 on Mac OS X and logged back in. Voila, I was able to use full without a problem. I think they just have a problem with Linux. They choose not to understand that Linux exists and is becoming a fairly strong force worldwide--kinda like how the U.S.-based media treats Ron Paul.'

Everything continued to work perfectly as long as you are not on the "Today" page with the incompatibility warning. Even more proof that Microsoft is pulling its usual dirty tricks.'

Anybody using Microsoft "products", and knows better, is an enabler that encourages this kind of behavior. Just say no. '
