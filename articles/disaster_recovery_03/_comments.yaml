    body: "<strong>From</strong>: Mik Yelrem\r\n<strong>Url</strong>: Cox.net\r\n<strong>Date</strong>: 2005-05-14\r\n<strong>Subject:</strong> Take out HD, copy it\r\n\r\n\r\nIf your laptop dies from coffee, and the Hard Drive (HD) is not damaged, then you should be able to take out the HD, put it into one of those adapters that make it so that you can plug it into an IDE cable.  Then connect it into your Desktop in an open IDE connector, then boot your Linux from a CD or Floppy (like Knoppix, your boot floppy for Linux, if you made one, or some way to bypass the possibility that the desktop will try to boot from the laptop HD).  Then you can use dd to copy your whole hard drive to another drive.  True, maybe you need to go buy another drive to copy to, but if you really want your configuration back in a form where it will work just as before, assuming no HD damage from the coffee, you have to copy the drive to another drive.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother thing you can do is get a USB hard drive case with the USB circuitry in it, and put your laptop HD into that.  Then you can plug that into a working computer and pretty much copy what you want into some disk space on the host computer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProbably the best thing would have been to just take out the hard drive, then get the laptop fixed while using a different hard drive (used just to make sure the repair worked), or buy a new hard drive to be used for this repair.  But keep the original HD that was in the laptop at your house. Then, when you get back the working laptop, just put in the original HD, and since it is going into the exact same type of computer, it should just work fine.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSure it may cost some for the extra hard drive, if you have to get one, but you get your data and configuration all back just fine, and no worries about anyone else getting your data.  At the repair shop perhaps all they will have to do is to put in some new components and just keep the old HD and it will work.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor data security people should buy a backup hard drive, and periodically copy the main drive to the backup drive.  The Knoppix Hacks (O'Reilly) book describes how to do these things.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUsing these techniques perhaps we can avoid shipping away our important data.  It may cost more, but it may be well worth it.  Then, even if coffee takes out the HD too, you still have everything up to the last backup date, and you can run from the backup hard drive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
