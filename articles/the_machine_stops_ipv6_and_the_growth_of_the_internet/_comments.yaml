It's a thing that should happen INSIDE you. \"Live in fragments no longer. Only connect, and the beast and the monk, robbed of the isolation what is life to either, will die.\" In Forster's fictional world, this connection is no connection to the outside world (though it results in one). Also, Forster didn't write about emails. Rather about telegraphy or the telephone. Unfortunately he wasn't much of a technology prophet. One has to read Wells or Zamyatin or ... for that."
