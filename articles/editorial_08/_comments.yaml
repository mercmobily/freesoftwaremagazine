If you consider censorship a form of tampering (e.g. a government trying to delete things it finds objectionable, or Scientology trying to remove items from the Internet Archive with their complience [http://news.com.com/2100-1023-959236.html]) then Freenet is an ideal solution as it very difficult to censor data on Freenet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGet in touch with the developers of Freenet if you're interested, or contact me at sm.synonymous@gmail.com if you want to talk about this issue."
