    body: "In response to the part about configuration files and directory structure being different on different distros, this is such an incredibly sad incredibly easy problem to fix.  To think that in this day and age with the Internet, and especially with Free Software and the interoperability that that should beg, this problem is a simple communication issue.  The LSB, instead of enforcing a particular type of directory structure which is pretty silly, should instead promote ways to make absolute paths not matter anymore and be a thing of the past.\r\n\r\nHave a system definition file which defines where certain types of files go, or basically make SOME kind of common API that gives flexibility to place files where ever you want them, someplace, so that locations don't matter.  For example, if you defined someplace the location of, say, Apache's config files, then any program could always find out where they were by querying this definition file.  It could be part of the package manager, since it's what placed everything everywhere to begin with so it should know.\r\n\r\nNot to take my own steam out of my sails but the funny thing is, or perhaps sad I'm not sure which, is that in a way I may be proposing basically the Windows registry.  Except, you know, hopefully not full of fail, since it would be just an open standard that's modular to allow the use of any programs around it.\r\n\r\nBut seriously, why can't you just query the package manager and ask it where the configuration file is located, because you should.  Whether that means more standardization or more metadata in packages, or what, it doesn't matter because it's something that should have happened 10 years ago.\r\n\r\nBut, yeah, standard points of communication so that Linux doesn't fragment and we can all get along much more easily without compromising customability or any powers we have at all.  On the contrary, we'd have more, because software accessibility means freedom, and this kind of crap is one thing that slows down Linux adoption, and it really must be gotten rid of.  For a long while distro companies have been seemingly loving these differences causing chaos because it helps them with software exclusivity on their systems, when all Linux software should be Linux software: modular, accessible, and truly free."
