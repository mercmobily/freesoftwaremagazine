Memory space initialization is on its way, but 3D wise, nothing works - they urgently need as much data about Nvidia hardware as they can get. http://nouveau.freedesktop.org"

    body: "Nice question, and the answer is easy. Nvidia didn't like Xgl for good reasons: simply put, it's not very elegant and although it can be used in an incredibly large array of applications, its design leads to compromised speed and prevents 3D rendering over a network connection. AIGLX being integrated with the server (the part of X that draws the images following the client's input: client being an application here), it is (hopefully) able to do 3D rendering even on a distant computer (equipped with a 3D card).\r\nNvidia declared itself in favour of such an extention, which was essentially developed by the Fedora project and adopted by Xorg. However, several technical snags appeared:\r\n- Geforce4 and lower, while still supported, require a different driver development than FX and up do: those older cards providing only fixed shader functions, tricks have to be used to support them. This led to the creation of 2 different drivers at Nvidia's, the latter 7x for Geforce4 and lower, and 8x for FX and higher (having tried the 8x with a GF4, I'm not sure it was sensible, but still...) mainly due to the following point:\r\n- The Xorg ABI has changed with version 7.1, requiring some extensive driver review, so Nvidia developers had their plates full.\r\n- completely unused until now and of little value because of that, the GL_EXT_texture_from_pixmap function is absent from their driver. The function's name seems to describe that a card supporting this extention may be able to grab a construct out of its frame buffer and directly exploit it as a texture. Stability- and security-wise it would be tricky to implement, and since Nvidia doesn't provide beta version of their Linux drivers...\r\n\r\nThe reason why most free 3D drivers already support this extention is because MesaGL already had it included; since Mesa use 3D acceleration when it can and falls back to software rendering when it can't, developers already had a reference rendering that they just needed to accelerate for their own card. Nvidia either use a too old version of Mesa, or just hadn't considered this extention (it's not part of core OpenGL 1.5 functions) until now.\r\n---\r\nA computer is like air conditioning: it becomes useless when you open windows."

TNT2 and higher may be fast enough. They require legacy Nvidia driver (71.82). 'MX' relates to both GF2MX and GF4MX, since both are Geforce2-level.</p>\r\n<p>(##)Tested on Geforce4, FX and 6. Slow video on Geforce4.</p>\r\n<p>(*)Card models named Rage128 were either Mach64 2D chips with added functionalities (those don't have a working DRM module) or 'real' 3D chips. The one I could try out (Rage128 TVout) could load AIGLX, but missed visuals 0x23 to 0x32 - so compiz wouldn't load.</p>\r\n<p>(**)Card models from 9500 to X600 use the R3xx chip family. 3D support is being implemented, and AIGLX is working on R3XX cores (tested 9500, got reports on 9600). R4xx is under heavy development. If the free driver supports 3D, then AIGLX support is practically guaranteed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of note: due to being able to make use of Mesa's fallback software rendering, XGL provides GL_EXT_texture_from_pixmap even on hardware that don't accelerate it due to missing driver functionality, while proprietary usually use an older revision of Mesa (or a complete proprietary implementation) that doesn't provide it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>'Useless' refers to the fact that there are no working proprietary 3D driver, and that the driver integrated with Xorg is good enough to run AIGLX - which works better than XGL anyway. So while XGL would work, it is of no use except if you use an older version of Xorg or Xfree86.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After more tries, it seems some cards will accept 3D acceleration in applications through XGL; I managed to run Google Earth 4 under XGL, with full acceleration, on my 6600. It may depend on the card's capabilities though.</p>\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n<p>A computer is like air conditioning: it becomes useless when you open windows.</p>"
