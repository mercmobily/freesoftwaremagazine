    body: 'Welcome back home and good you had a great time! As for the program in the plane, Linux? Really? I''ve been on a lot of different Asian airlines and most still use Windows. Although the laptops and desktops are pretty much the same with some having Linux pre-installed. And yes, some even offer to install pirated versions of windows if you want to go cheap. To this I say, stick with Linux.'
