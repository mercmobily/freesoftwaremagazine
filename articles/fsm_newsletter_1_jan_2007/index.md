Seasons greetings, readers... welcome to our New Year’s edition of the Free Software Magazine newsletter! Happy New Year, and Happy Reading!


# General announcements

We haven’t had many developments during the last three weeks due to our own festivities—and we put off the release of this newsletter because who needs extra distractions around this time of year? However, we have a very important announcement to make—a huge thank you to all our readers, contributors, supporters and sponsors for making Free Software Magazine the massive success that it has been. Our progress over the last year puts us firmly in top place as THE magazine about free software and it is all down to you. And if you thought last year was good, wait until you see what we have in store for you this year—we have a lot planned!

# Poll Results—What’s your favourite desktop environment?

Not surprisingly, there was stiff competition between GNOME and KDE and at one point it appeared GNOME was going to win. However, KDE just leapt ahead as the winner with 44% of the vote in the final days. GNOME followed with 37% of the vote, and then there was a sharp drop to “other” with 10% of the vote—it seems we should have included Fluxbox as an option... sorry about that Fluxbox users. This was followed by XFCE with 8%, and then Enlightenment with a tiny 2%. And from your comments, favourite desktop environment is chosen by a combination of personal preference and how much usability you need and want. Read more [here](http://www.freesoftwaremagazine.com/node/1936) and stay tuned for...


# This fortnight’s poll

[What’s the main reason why you use free/open source software?](http://www.freesoftwaremagazine.com/node/1976)

Do you use free software because you have a highly developed ethical compass? Or because it’s light on your wallet? Maybe you like the support that's available or like to help people yourself. Tell us what you think!
