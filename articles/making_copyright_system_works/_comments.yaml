    body: "Nice analysis of the issues!\r\n\r\nFor the record: I think you're right that if there is to be copyright, that there shouldn't be an initial registration fee.  And formal registration itself, with or without a fee, isn't even so important anymore in these days of search engines and data tagging; clear marking on the work itself is enough.  But as you point out, at some point registration would still be needed to record a buyout price.  (By the way, you explained my idea much more clearly than I did; I'm going to be copying your paragraph.)\r\n\r\nFrom a framing point of view, I confess I'm skeptical of the notion that copyright was created to incentivize creation at all -- historically it doesn't seem like it was, and certainly that can't be the motivation behind its recent extensions either, as you showed graphically (note to self: a picture really is worth a thousand words sometimes).  But you show how even <em>granting</em> that assumption, much better systems are possible.\r\n\r\nI think the link to the Creator Endorsed Mark might have been left blank, because it just links back to this page right now.  The mark's home page is http://questioncopyright.org/creator_endorsed.  Note that we're trademarking it so we can help artists can enforce it -- the terms allow artists to use the mark for their own works without consulting with us first."

However, more highly educated people will want real objective evidence for the things you write.\r\n\r\nAfter reading half of the article, I stopped, because it seemed to drone on about details that the author wanted to tell me. This article is really a verbal commercial for your viewpoint, and it is not much else.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    body: "What sort of \"evidence\" would satisfy you? :-)\r\n\r\nI take it as writ that the main matters of fact -- i.e. the present state of the copyright system, how it got there, the legal action of various licenses, etc -- are stipulated to by all parties. Those just aren't controversial matters.\r\n\r\n(If you disagree, please indicate what facts you dispute).\r\n\r\nThe questions of interest are not ones of fact, therefore \"evidence\" is not terribly applicable. I have linked to several prior analyses, which I highly recommend. I had considered doing a point-by-point comparison, but it was much easier to write my own synthesis of the ideas (very little of the above is truly original -- I've just made a few trims and fusions of existing ideas).\r\n\r\nMy main interest here is to collect what I consider good ideas and see if they can form a coherent whole. I think they can. Whether I've actually created the right fusion or not, is secondary.\r\n\r\nYour criticism is a little disappointing, though, because you haven't actually picked out any points that you take issue with. Or challenged this idea with an alternative.\r\n\r\nPlease feel free to do so.\r\n"

I'm afraid it may take some time to correct it in the article itself.\r\n\r\nIncentivizing creation is the US constitutional justification for copyright, whatever its earlier motivations might have been.\r\n\r\nThis is valuable, because it then becomes valid in US courts to argue that copyright laws which do not result in incentives for creation are unconstitutional abrogations of first amendment free speech rights.\r\n\r\nSo, even if that's obviously not the \"real\" reason for it, it's useful to start from there."

    body: "I began reading your article to get my thinking started regarding some proposed changes to our patent law system under bill S.515. I don't know a lot of details about copyright and have not read the papers you cited. Though reading those papers may be in my future. \r\n\r\nMy frustrations with your article may have more to do with my mindset as an engineer than anything else. However, I do believe that my criticism does hold true in the respect that there is a lack of evidence for many opinions stated in the article. \r\n\r\nThat said, I got little out of reading your article, because early on I did not believe you had anything more than an opinion regarding this matter. Our current culture supports something I call reason making, of which you do a lot of. Reason making is having an opinion and then coming up with a lot of reasons to support my opinion without considering contrary ideas or searching for real facts to support my case. Considering contrary ideas and finding real evidence or facts is quite difficult, which explains our culture's love with reason making. This seems to be reflected in your own comment that \"I had considered doing a point-by-point comparison, but it was much easier to write my own synthesis of the ideas.\" And then later, \"My main interest here is to collect what I consider good ideas and see if they can form a coherent whole. I think they can. Whether Iâ€™ve actually created the right fusion or not, is secondary.\" I value the 'right fusion', not a compilation of someone's opinions.\r\n\r\nI picked out a particular statement from your article to illustrate.\r\n\r\n\"copyright should exist on a strict use-it-or-lose-it basis\"\r\n\r\nWhy? Who would benefit? Who would be harmed? And it goes farther than this. Are there any places that have such a copyright system in place right now or in history? How do such systems compare in the area of creativity? \r\n\r\nIn addition, based on your reply to my comment, your article sited \r\n\r\n\"Copyright as a Privilege and a Debt to Society--Not a Right\"\r\n\r\nTalking about oxymorons. If so, why not call it copyprivilege? This statement seems to illustrate that you believe that you naturally own anything in the free space of ideas and writing and don't need to respect others.\r\n\r\nOverall, I think that we probably differ in opinion as well. It is my opinion that creativity is much more rare than hard work. However, I think that society progresses from both. In addition, many people will steal ideas from others and never even take the time to say thank you. Our current culture seems to value hard work over creativity. I believe that this is a tragedy. And the attacks on the patent system and other intellectual property law seem to support my opinion. However, I look for objective evidence to support my ideas and opinions and do not persuade others with long winded discussion. I could go on, but that would be self defeating.\r\n\r\nI hope this supplies what you were asking for. \r\n\r\n\r\n"
