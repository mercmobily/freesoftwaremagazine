    body: "The hard thing is deciding which thing that I do has the most impact. Is it more important that I write documentation, promote the ideas behind free software in my writing, or that I actually write some free software?\r\n\r\nI don't write a large volume of stuff myself, but I do practice what I preach. And I think maybe that's why I had to pick \"write software\" on this list. It's not what I do most, but it may be what I do that's most important.\r\n\r\nI think that, aside from the obvious benefits of growing the pool of software that is available and solving specific technical problems, it also gives you an important perspective on the ethical, pragmatic, and economic aspects that surround software. We have a lot of funny ideas pushed on to us by various special interests, and the only way to get a feel for how things really work is to try it yourself.\r\n\r\nI don't write free software out of some kind of martyr complex, I do it because it's fun, and for me, it's the most practical way to get what I want done (\"If you want it done right...\").\r\n\r\nI also picked it because it's what I did today! <em>Voila</em>, fresh out of the oven:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=8578&package_id=226251\">Palimpsest 0.1-alpha</a> (<a href=\"http://sourceforge.net/project/shownotes.php?release_id=496146&group_id=8578\">Release Notes</a>).\r\n\r\n\"The purpose of Palimpsest is to unify access to metadata (especially attribution and licensing data) in a range of multimedia files. It implements a plugin scheme for fully-supporting native metadata in specific filetypes, as well as an XMP scanner for unrecognized files.\"\r\n\r\nIt's only a week since I started writing it, so it's still pretty primitive, but I plan to extend it considerably. I'll probably write a blog about it when it actually supports more than GIF files (don't ask me why I started with GIF, it wasn't exactly a rational decision, it just sort of happened -- PNG and JPG are coming soon, then probably SVG and Ogg Vorbis, as well as about 3 more abstraction layers in the interface which will make it a lot more useful).\r\n\r\n"

    body: "I think you're overstating the importance of the FSF to free software, just a little bit...\r\n\r\nThe GNU project, which is what the FSF directly supports, accounts for roughly 25% of free software. Another 25% is in several unaffiliated large projects (some of which are among the most important on the desktop: X, Mozilla, OpenOffice.org, Linux itself). The remaining 50% is created by \"the field\" -- independent developers.\r\n\r\nWhat would principally happen if there were suddenly no FSF today:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The term \"free software\" might go out of vogue (but I doubt it would disappear entirely)</li>\r\n<li>Important \"cathedral\" projects, like Gnash, for example, would founder -- because these projects are driven by user need rather than \"developers scratching an itch\". IOW, there are some projects that won't happen (or won't happen quickly enough) unless someone sponsors their development.</li>\r\n<li>Other people would have to absorb the burden of maintaining GNU utilities (but they are mostly mature)</li>\r\n<li>Infrastructure for fighting GPL violations would have to be provided by someone else.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nOf course, that's if they disappeared today. They were more important in the past. Had FSF not invented the GPL, or originally written the GNU system, it probably would've taken longer to discover the copyleft idea and that would have had disastrous consequences.\r\n\r\nHowever, FSF didn't invent free software, they just gave it a name and a definition.\r\n"

It was the FSF who devised the license which is today used by ca. 75% of all FOSS projects. And currently they kill themselves by coming up with a next version by wrapping their brains around legally, economically and politically difficult issues to which other leaders in the community show no interest or sometimes even disrespect.\r\nI agree with you, FSF is not the body/group of people who has contributed most of the free code in the world today. But without their contribution not so much code would (and perhaps could) have been written at all. \r\nThis is not about quantity, but about doing the right things. So, I think respect where respect is due."

I think this is one of the great plus points of the free software world. The fact that you and I can join in by writing HOWTOs, guides and general tips means we can all take part without actually having to write code.\r\n\r\nI suspect that more people contribute than this poll indicates though because at first I thought it meant writing help files and the like for specific packages. Of course it can also mean writing helpful webpages, posting HOWTOs to TLDP, contributing to WIKIs etc. All of this is documentation - especially because the nature of software documentation has changed. Yes I still read books but increasingly the \"documentation\" I use includes bits gleaned from forums, mailing lists and other websites."
