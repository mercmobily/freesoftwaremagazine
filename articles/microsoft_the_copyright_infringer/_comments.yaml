Why wouldn't Microsoft (or anyone) be able to sell programs they get from Novell (assuming no copying on their part, and that the copies from Novell are legal) without accepting the license which covers those programs?\r\n\r\n2. IANAL.  Why selling vouchers is considered a software redistribution?  For example, if my friend counterfeited music CDs and gave them away, but it was I who collected the money for them, would I be distributing them? (Would I infringe the copyright directly at all, or would it be merely a contributory infringement?)\r\n\r\n3. I have not seen Microsoft's vouchers, I don't know what they contain.  Is Novell actually selling GPL software, or services?  Couldn't Microsoft sell those vouchers only for Novell's services, too, (and perhaps, also for other items which Novell can license, like icons, pictures, sounds, restricted software etc.), not covering the bundled GPL software?  Would GPL license bind them in this situation?\r\n\r\nI don't defend Microsoft, I use and benefit from free software myself, I'm genuinely interested in answering my questions, and I'll be thankful if I can get an answer.\r\n\r\n"

    body: "Thank you for your reply, although I don't think it really answers my questions.  In Microsoft-Novell setup it's not Microsoft that does the copying, but Novell does (further on I'll assume Novell has right to do it). Microsoft by selling vouchers is merely handing out a kind of new currency, for which you can buy something from Novell.  Which exactly author's exclusive right is being trespassed by Microsoft?\r\n\r\nI'll rehash my questions again, so that I'm clearly understood:\r\n\r\n1. I question the assumption by which reselling copyrighted work automatically violates the copyright - see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-sale_doctrine and some example cases there.  I simply don't believe that  the copyright gives an author right to control subsequent resale of his work (I don't mean copying here!), and hence, no license is necessary to buy and sell, whatever way.\r\n\r\n2. I question the assumption I often see, that selling vouchers is automatically a redistribution of a work; it's not even a sale of the work.  I don't see a connection.  As I said above, vouchers are a kind of currency for which you can buy something at Novell's. The act of selling is performed at Novell's - there you go and exchange money (or vouchers) for goods (software) or services.  I don't see how Microsoft might be accused of redistributing anything; suppose, instead of vouchers, they were throwing out real money shouting \"Buy yourselves SLES, or candies!\", would you call that a redistribution, too?  I wouldn't.\r\n\r\n3. I question the notion that Microsoft is actually \"selling\" any GPL software via its vouchers at all. The vouchers cannot cover something Novell does not sell, that's why I asked the question: does Novell really sell GPL software, or merely bundle it with other things (services).  Recently I read some place Microsoft stating explicitly it's vouchers won't cover GPLv3 software parts.  So on what basis can we claim their \"sale\" involves GPLv3 soft, when they themselves deny it?\r\n\r\nIt's not that I'm attacking your article, I think it merely repeats the same arguments I saw many times in other places.  I just thought someone at FSM might be able to clarify these issues for me.  If you aren't able to give a precise explanation, please say so, I'll try asking somewhere else.  Thank you again. "

    body: "I must apologize, I found your initial comment about second sale doctrine as you initially expressed it as ludicrous.  Let's discuss what is actually done here.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft sells vouchers for a good that does not exist yet.  It is clearly the seller because it is establishing terms of sale, and offers additional terms of it's own which include a patent use license.\r\n\r\nSince the goods being sold do not yet exist, they have to be \"created\".  This means a copy is manufactured by Novell and \"conveyed\" as part of the sale.  Microsoft has no legal right to bring this copy into existence because it is not a copyright holder.  Second sale does not apply to copying because there was no first sale of copyright ownership anywhere in the chain.  Therefore the only legal instrument enabling it to do so and thereby complete the sale is the GNU GPL.  Whether Novell is licensed to do so or not does not mean Microsoft is, unless it does so under the terms of the license that permits it to do so, whether they make the copy themselves or subcontract someone else, which in effect is the relationship they have established with Novell.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft does not seem to (at least at present) represent it's vouchers as a second sale of a Novell CD but rather as a funny kind of first sale, and this is their problem.  There are actually other significant problems they would face if they did choose to claim they are second selling existing Novell CD's rather than conveying newly minted ones as part of a sale that also includes a patent use license, and should that happen, I would be happy to write about the folly of that approach as well :).\r\n"

In my view they sell Novell's promises, not software, but in legal terms I'm might be wrong here.\r\n\r\n> and offers additional terms of it's own which include a patent > use license.\r\n\r\nThey cannot set any additional terms on software which is not of their own, or they have no right to.  Adding their patent license is orthogonal to the precise issue under discussion.  (They may always give their patent license to anybody under any circumstances.)\r\n\r\n> This means a copy is manufactured by Novell and \"conveyed\" as > part of the sale.\r\n\r\nBut it's \"conveyed\" by Novell, not by Microsoft.  I thought copyright governed certain *physical* actions.  For example, if I would illegally \"distribute\" software through mirrors, it's the mirrors (and downloaders) that would be responsible for their copying action; they couldn't claim that only I was guilty, because it was only I who did the distribution.  For another example, those who make links to unauthorised copies, are not sued for trespassing copyright, but rather for inducing copyright infringement, which is a different matter.\r\n\r\n> Second sale does not apply to copying because there was no first > sale of copyright ownership anywhere in the chain.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft bought those vouchers from Novell, didn't they?  If you equal selling vouchers to selling software (which I don't, yet) then Microsoft are reselling whatever they bought from Novell, and they don't need a license for that, just as well they wouldn't need a license to resell books.  And Novell has license (GPL) to sell the software, it is not bound by contract to ascertain that the buyer accepts its terms (or is it?).\r\n\r\nFor the second thing, I believe licitly downloading (copying) software from FSF constitutes kind of legal transaction, a first \"sale for free\", price doesn't matter (it might be a present), and selling or giving away these same copies (without further copying) might not require license under copyright.  But this is only my projection, IANAL, I might be wrong here.\r\n\r\n> whether they make the copy themselves or subcontract someone > else, which in effect is the relationship they have established > with Novell.\r\n\r\nI rather view it as a partnership relation, not a subcontract - Microsoft didn't make a contract with, and is not paying Novell to produce software for Microsoft.  Those vouchers are issued by Novell, not by Microsoft, isn't that right?\r\n\r\nAnyway, if something is not right with the current Microsoft-Novell contract wording, they may still be able to amend it to \"make it right\".  I'm sorry, your arguments haven't convinced me.  It's not specifically GPLv3 that might be faulty, I think it's been a good advancement, but I believe that copyright law itself might be a too weak weapon.  I hope that FSF has good lawyers and they know what they're doing; but OTOH in court cases roughly half the attorneys are usually proved wrong.  Microsoft's lawyers aren't stupid either. Thank you for the nice talk, I'll be waiting for your next article. "

    body: "<cite>So how can they *now* infringe the copyright on software which will exist only in future?</cite>\r\n\r\nAs I said, Microsoft doesn't necessarily infringe on anyone's copyright. It's all about the patent license. It's only when they refuse to grant the required patent licenses that they're infringing (and who doubts that they'll voluntarily comply? ;-) )\r\n\r\nRichard Stallman said this during the launch event (<strong>http://gplv3.fsf.org/rms_gplv3_launch_transcript</strong>)\r\n\r\n<cite>However, instead of simply saying that Novell can't distribute GPL version 3 covered programs under their deal, we found a cleverer thing to do with it. When Microsoft updates to versions that are covered by GPL version 3, GPL version 3 will extend this patent protection from the customers of Novell to everybody who uses those programs. [...] So, it's extremely important for free software to upgrade the license to GPL version 3. So that, Novell, in the course of time, will put in the new versions, and thus our community will get this benefit. It has to be done fairly soon, because if we wait too long, Microsoft may distribute all its coupons and then we won't be able to turn the deal against them anymore. So, get your programs relicensed soon, it's very important.</cite>\r\n\r\n\r\n<cite>But it's \"conveyed\" by Novell, not by Microsoft. I thought copyright governed certain *physical* actions.</cite>\r\n\r\nI'm not a lawyer either, but it seems that if two parties conspire to infringe someone's copyright, they're both liable for infringement (or whatever that's legally called). Maybe a bad comparison, but if one guy aims with a gun and one pulls the trigger, <strong>neither</strong> one can claim they didn't intend to shoot.\r\n\r\nThe FSF says this interpretation worked in the past, for example in this case (citing RMS from \"Free Software, Free Society\"):\r\n\r\n<cite>Consider GNU Objective C. NeXT initially wanted to make this front end proprietary; they proposed to release it as .o ﬁles, and let users link them with the rest of GCC, thinking this might be a way around the GPL's requirements. But our lawyer said that this would not evade the requirements, that it was not allowed.</cite>\r\n\r\nI was also puzzled how NeXT distributed anything or created derivatives of anyone's work--but I assume they wouldn't have released their code without a compelling reason. The keyword seems to be \"subterfuge for distribution,\" whatever this means. (Does someone know the legal meaning of this phrase?)\r\n"
