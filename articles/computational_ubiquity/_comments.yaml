    body: "An intriguing thought which relates to how much computers have changed over the last 40 years:\r\n\r\nOne of the main plot points of the movie Apollo 13 (and of course, one of the main problems of the actual mission), was the need to shut down the computer in order to save power for life-support and recovery operations once back at Earth (there is, for example, a scene in which the crew has to make a seat-of-the-pants burn, because the computer is simply off -- this was actually done, by the way, though I'm not sure how accurately it is depicted in the film).\r\n\r\nToday, this is an absolutely insane idea. A computer capable of doing what the on-board computer on Apollo 13 could do would, today, fit in the palm of your hand and consume a negligible amount of power (it could run off of a photovoltaic cell that would need only about enough light to read the LCD display by -- if you can see it, there's enough power to run it!)\r\n\r\nWe now take this for granted, and we use tiny embedded computers all over the place (count the devices with CPUs in your home: microwave ovens, conventional ovens, some refrigerators, certainly your TV, VCR, DVD player, wrist-watch, and so on). It's a far cry from Apollo era small-scale integration chip transistor-transistor logic computers (SSI TTL) which sucked down huge amounts of power by today's standards, not to mention having to dissipate that power as heat. We're about as far beyond those computers as they were beyond vacuum tubes (or maybe further).\r\n\r\nI think about this every time I watch the movie, along with other evidences of the \"stone knives and bearskins\" we used to get to the moon in the 1960s. Those spacecraft were actually made out of <em>metal</em>, because modern engineering composites hadn't been invented yet (you know, things like the carbon-composite rods you'll find in any ordinary camping tent nowadays?). Yet, most people continue to think that space has to be developed through huge, para-military government projects because it's \"high-tech\".\r\n\r\nBut I digress... ;-)\r\n\r\nNice article. I do hope we will begin to see a re-personalization of technology through the commoditization of the hardware and the freeing of the software. The centralization of power is worrying, and the best way to counter it is to get that power back in the hands of the people.\r\n"

    body: "That is very true. And that is the main point I learned from <em>The Third Wave</em>: during the start of dramatic change, it is those who embrace and take advantage of change that gain power. Whether this is true or not, I can't say, but empirically it seems true. I believe we geeks have the power to \"ride the wave,\" as it were.\r\n\r\nThe book predicted drastic reaction against change from those who are entrenched in the old ways. This has resulted in war in the past, and may bring war in the future. But at a minimum, I believe it explains the over-reaction of the RIAA, and patent trolls, and those who seek to extend copyright for eternity. Notice the pattern: each of these seeks to control the flow and use of information.\r\n\r\nToffler also states that those reactions are doomed, because the changes brought by each wave are <em>inevitable</em>. It's like building a sand wall against the advancing tide-- you might be able to slow it down, but eventually the wall will be overcome.\r\n\r\nAgain, you'll have to judge the validity of that conclusion on your own. Part of it assumes you buy into the whole \"wave\" concept of civilization. For me, it empirically seems correct, or at least modestly accurate.\r\n\r\nI see Microsoft as a hybrid old-school industrial / new-wave tech company. Notice how slow Microsoft is to adopt new technology or new ideas. They tend to follow the lead, rather than lead themselves. This is an excellent business strategy, as long as the lead-time is long, and development time is short. But, in the end, they stick with an old-school approach, with central control, and a factory-line method of development.\r\n\r\nI could be wrong. I hope not, but I could be wrong."

    body: "I've been working on a model where a community owns the utilities -- I think Internet access is the easiest to handle, and I'm looking into electricity, mass media (although a community Internet may take care of that as well), waterworks, etc. The idea is that a organization of all the residents of a community owns the infrastructure and, if they don't have in-house expertise, outsource its operations and maintenance. For instance, they'd purchase a computer to serve as their Internet gateway (plus associated other equipment), a wireless router, and Wireless Access Points as last-mile devices. They'd either operate and maintain the equipment themselves, or hire a group to do it for them. If they're not satisfied with that group, they can fire them and hire another one.\r\n\r\nThe way things work now, if you're not happy with your Internet Service Provider, you either put up with them, or vote with your wallet in the hopes that your next choice is at least marginally better. I know of several people who are serial ISP subscribers -- they sign up with one, cancel after some time, sign up with a second one, cancel again, and again, and again. If, on the other hand, the community owns the infrastructure and controls the management, they'll have the true power. That would include making decisions about computing ubiquity (to put the discussion back on topic :) Seriously, I don't know how much the big commercial interests are willing to invest in that regard.\r\n\r\nOh, and to keep it on the topic of the <strong>magazine</strong> -- I took my inspiration for the model from Free Software.\r\n\r\nStill working on my model :)\r\n\r\nDaniel O.
