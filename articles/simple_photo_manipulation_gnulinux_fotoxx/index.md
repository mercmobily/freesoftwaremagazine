Image manipulation in GNU/Linux has always been associated with The Gimp. However, most users will find Gimp vastly oversized for their needs. Fotoxx is a neat, simple and yet very advanced photo manipulation software that is definitely worth installing and playing with.

# Installation

Ubuntu's repositories carry a rather old version of Fotoxx. So, I strongly advise you download the latest version of fotoxx from [Kornelix.com](http://www.kornelix.com/packages.html). The latest one available, 15.05, has a much improved interface and is more stable.

I won't get into the detail about installing a package; however, Ubuntu users should be OK with just double-clicking on the .deb file.

When you first start up Fotoxx, it will ask you to locate the folder with your images. Fotoxx will then create a searchable index of them, very much like most of other image processing programs.

# Using the program: photo manipulation

I am the least artistic person, and was able to create several funny images starting from a photo of my wife.

Manipulating an image is really fun -- especially when the victim is your own unsuspecting wife. The effects are really, really simple to use and understand. Plus, they always offer a live, real-time preview of what they will show.

Undo/redo has a slightly unconventional pattern: left mouse click will undo, and right mouse click will redo.

=IMG=2.png=I discovered I am pretty good at line drawing. Menu: Effects > Line drawing=

=IMG=3.png=I wonder what she looked like with a slightly longer neck and a big chin. Now I know. Menu: Bend > Warp curved=

=IMG=4.png=Chiara in a highly artistic representation of herself. Menu: Edit > Retouch Combo=

=IMG=5.png=Digital weeding at work. Note that there is no overgrown grass next to Chiara's right shoulder. Menu: Repair > Paint/Clone pixels=

In general, the user guide is really well written and comprehensive. You can get to it by pressing F1. I recommend you read it if you want to discover how to use these rather advanced, and yet simple, effects! There is a one-page document, also reachable from Help > Quick Start, that has a quick summary of how to use Fotoxx.

**Reading the first few pages of the user guide is not optional!**

I don't like using bold fonts in articles. However, this is so important, it cannot be underestimated. The software's author is very clear about this: it takes a little while to get used to it, and it diverges (slightly) from what you normally see from programs. However, this is not necessarily a bad thing -- it's just something you need to keep in mind.

# Using the program: gallery

Fotoxx can be used as a gallery manager. It also comes with a World Map. I have to be honest: the use of these functionalities is beyond the scope of this review. However, you are certainly most welcome to play with them.

# Conclusion

The editing abilities of Fotoxx are enough to make it a must if you want to be able to edit your photos and have professional-like results in no time.

Here is a list of capabilities, taken straight from Fotoxx's guide itself:

 * Thumbnail browser / navigator with variable size thumbnails and list view.
 * Camera RAW file conversion with retention of 16 bits per color.
 *  Internal processing in 24 bits per color (float), image file output in 8 or 16 bits.
 *  A comprehensive set of image edit, retouch and repair functions: brightness, color, contrast, tone mapping, trim, resize, rotate, de-noise, paint, clone, red eyes, write text, warp, HDR, panorama, art effects ...
 *  Select image areas or objects, edit separately from background, copy and paste.
 * Rapid visual feedback using the full image or selected zoom-in area.
 * Metadata editing and reporting (tags, dates, captions, geotags, ratings ... )
 * Batch tools for file renaming, resizing, converting, adding and revising metadata.
 *  Search images using any metadata, directory / file names or substrings.
 * Geotag mapping and reporting by location or by clicking on a geographic map.
 * Create albums (collections or "views") with images from various directories.
 * Montage: arrange images and text in an arbitrary (huge) layout.
 * Slide show with various animated transitions, image zoom-in.
 * Comprehensive user guide and help popups.
 
Enjoy!

# Update

**Update since publishing the article**: I've been communicating with Fotoxx's author as well as Richard Miler, a Fotoxx user; I was asked honest feedback on how to address some of the issues I raised in the original article; well, I did -- I spent a good couple of hours working out all of the usability issues I could find, and sent it to Fotoxx's author. My email followed a lengthy discussion with him. My work was appreciated: Fotoxx's author has addressed all of the issues I raised (!) which did, no doubt, take a _lot_ more than a couple of hours to fix!. The changes are in the July 2015 release of Fotoxx.   After 20 years of free software, I had never experienced such prompt action stemming from my comments. Thanks! **End of update**
