LFNW is the showcase for what people in the Northwest are doing with Linux and open source software. It's a place for Linux enthusiasts to get together to share their passion for what good software can do. This is an opportunity for everyone... satisfy your curiosity... get free stuff... ask experts... explore the latest in software technology... support freedom... experience the magic of grassroots software.

LFNW is generously hosted by Bellingham Technical College. During the Fest you can meet with representatives from BTC technical programs or enjoy a salmon barbecue lunch prepared by BTC culinary students.

Come hear speakers from ActiveState, Bungee Labs, Hewlett Packard, MySQL, OLPC, PostgreSQL, Red Hat, and many others.

Pogo Linux is sponsoring two charter buses to transport attendees from the Seattle area to LinuxFest. One bus will run each day of the Fest. Space is limited.
