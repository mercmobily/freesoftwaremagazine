    body: "> LFNW is the showcase for what people in the _Northwest_ are doing ...[emphasis mine]\r\n\r\nI'm reminded of a line in the first program of the most recent Doctor Who revival. Rose Tyler asks Christopher Eccleston's Doctor why he has a northern accent. He replies  \"Lot's of planets have a north\".\r\n\r\nLots of countries have a northwest as well, it might be better next time if you specify which country you are talking about ;o)\r\n\r\nHope the show goes well.  \r\nRyan"
