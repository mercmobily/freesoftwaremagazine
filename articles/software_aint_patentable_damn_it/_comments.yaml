    body: "Yes, specific machines are patentable. And yes, a particular general-purpose computer executing a particular set of machine instructions is operating as a specific machine.\r\n\r\nHowever, people do not program \"particular sets of machine instructions\", and haven't done so since the first assembler was written well over 50 years ago for the EDSAC. Source code is not directly executable (even in an interpreter, it must be converted into some more amenable structure before it can be processed), and as such is a description of an algorithm - an abstract, mathematical process - primarily intended for communication between humans. As such, it isn't a part of the \"specific machine\", and hence should not be patentable. This is especially true when one considers that there are any number of mappings from source code to the machine instructions that will constitute such a \"specific machine\" - it's far, far from being a one-to-one process. (If you doubt it, try to go the other way.)\r\n\r\nMoreover, the \"specific machine\" is constituted by the entire combination of general purpose hardware plus every piece of specific software running on that machine - in short, the entire system. Individual techniques used in such systems do not constitute specific machines any more than cogs and springs do when removed from a watch.\r\n\r\nTo further the analogy - to make the claim that a piece of source code, describing an isolated algorithm, is a \"specific machine\" is roughly equivalent to claiming that instead of a watch being patentable, a spring under tension should be the subject of a patent, and that any application of a tense spring would require a licence for such a patent. (And when we consider situations like the patent on XOR-ing a cursor onto a screen, we're getting into territory similar to the patenting of potential energy itself.)\r\n\r\nAt its core, this is why we jump up and down and insist that patenting software is Just Wrong. Yes, software patents have brought progress, experimentation and interoperability to a virtual standstill in the industry; but those issues don't help with the legal arguments. What matters is that the idea that Kenneth Stein outlined - that general purpose computer + machine code = specific machine, ergo source code = patentable - is <em>just plain wrong</em>, and the Supreme Court needs to be led to the understanding that it's wrong.\r\n\r\n-- Gwenhwyfaer"

If the market is global the patent costs can be over $250,000, so no profit for some years.\r\nI think we need a patent system so developers have time to recoup their costs and make a profit, but also need a way of getting low cost world patents similar to the Australian model.

This \"industry\" has absolutely nothing to do with the intent of \"patent protection\" embedded into the U.S. Constitution in Article I, Section 8, Clause 8: \"To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts by securing for limited Time to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries.\"\r\n\r\nHere \"Authors/Writings\" doesn't refer (in common vernacular) to literature or music, but to scientific/technological discoveries.\r\n\r\nAs you recognize, this industry of lawyers, IP vultures, and investors dependent on software patents, could care less about promoting the progress of science, especially since it has to actively fight to retard technological progress to profit off its patent portfolio.\r\n\r\nBut again, software (as US Supreme Court precedent has already established) is essentially no different than music or literature --  it is merely the expression of an idea of how to do something. Would you suggest that an architectural blueprint of a building, or a car design, are \"inventions\" that should warrant patent protection too?\r\n\r\nIt is unfortunate that the parasitic greedy nature of capitalism promotes the mere making of money by exerting the least amount of energy and intelligence. So, as you acknowledge, the current legal system, from lawyers to judges, have agreed among themselves, that they will promote this fiction of software patents because they stand to greatly profit from its creation and expansion.\r\n\r\nIf you were truly interested in making money off innovative technology then you probably shouldn't look at patenting it anyway, since that would force you to reveal the \"invention\" to anyone who sees the patent (and there are people/groups who just scan patents for ideas).\r\n\r\nMany companies who make \"real things\" don't even bother to patent them, they keep their inventions \"secret\" and just profit from the fruits of these inventions. These are referred to as \"trade secrets,\" which companies take great measure to keep secret. It is much better to try to maintain a \"trade secret\" into perpetuity than to patent the  same inventions (making it public knowledge) to eventually lose exclusivity to its use after a period of time.\r\n\r\nIt seems like you are more worried about being denied the ability to make \"easy money\" off of an idea that is not novel or non-obvious enough for you to just create a business around solely on the merits of the technology involved. But patent protection was never meant to allow profit from ideas just because you have an idea -- does it promote science, or just your pocket book?\r\n\r\nAs FOSS proves, you don't necessarily need patent, copyright, or trademark protection if you have truly novel ideas, and know how to effectively market and manage them.  The main problem with people in a capitalistic society is that you want to hoard solely for yourself the fruits of your ideas, even though you need other people's skills and labor to profit from them. If you thought holistically and realized your profit is best obtained by other people motivated to also profit from your ideas, then it could be win-win for a large group of people versus win-lose for primarily you, as this capitalistic economic system promotes.\r\n\r\nI would encourage you to think about technology more from the point of view of its usefulness to society, and not as a profit generating vehicle. If its useful, people will help you make money from it, if its not, then no amount of artificial protection will help you if no one wants to use/buy it in the first place.\r\n"

Individuals making intelectual discoveries end up with one, or mabey two patents, if they even beleive in protecting themselves, while the people who already have firm groundings in the industry only try to deepen their rock-solid grip even farther.\r\n\r\nThe legal reason why software patents are contradictory to existing laws or standards is that software is data.  If you write a story on paper, it is data.  If you write a story in a word processing program, it is data.  You dont patent the story, you copyright it.  If you were to patent parts of the story, you would be able to say that untill your patent expires, no other writer can have the antagonist of the story die from falling off a cliff, or that the main character's dog may not be a doberman.  WHAT KIND OF LUNACY WOULD SUCH A LAW BRING TO THE WORLD??  Unfortunately, the same is already true of software, which is technically no different from a written story except that it is written in a different language: one computers can interpret.  If you write down (on paper) an algorithm which decodes a file format, this is not a patentable \"invention.\"  It is not even an invention, it is just a mathmatical algorithm.  If you type the same algorithm into a word processor, it is still not patentable.  It is still just a mathmatical algorithm.  However - if you decide to write this algorithm in C (a programming language, for those who are just peering in on the problem and not actual developers), the program is now a patentable \"invention,\" even though it is still _just data_, no different from the story or the algorithm written on paper.\r\n\r\nSome argue that physical pattern in memory or on the hard drive is patentable, but what if the filesystem or operating system is encoded differently?  these patents are not grounded logically.  They are equal to patenting water as \"an apperatus to cooling things\" because it is _sometimes_ found in frozen form.\r\n\r\nI could go on, but I want to get back to work on my programming - god forbid any of the underlying technoledgies were legal (due to patent restrictions, see this for example: http://freetype.sourceforge.net/patents.html ).\r\n\r\n-- Zorro"

You could say that I'm the author of that machine code as well.  I invent another command call \"+\" to do addition and after compiling it, it turns into the machine code \"1000101101\".  I'm the author of that too.\r\n\r\n2.  Microsoft makes a program with the file word2.exe in it.  This file is nothing but machine instruction that contains the machine code for \"+\" and \"print\".\r\n\r\n3.  Microsoft patents this program, but he just patented my machine code as well.  That's not fair.\r\n\r\nPut another way, I invent a human language called espositus.  Shakespeare's great, great, great, great, grandson named Shakie makes a play using espositus and patents it.  He's patenting my language.  He can't patent the words that I invented.  But he has other remedies by law to prevent me from saying that I'm the author of Shakie's play."

The analogy that comes the closes to me is the phonograph, which has been around for a long time {okay obsolete now for most part}, so there is a long history.  The phonograph is patentable, the recording media was patentable,whether as the original cylinder, or the improvement to 78s or later 45s, LP 33s or quadraphonic, but the songs embedded in the media... sorta like a embedded software is embedded in a ROM chip, was only copyrightable.  Imagine all the music we would have missed had the first recording studio and artist, say the Chiffons, had patented the look and feel of the Motown Sound. There would have been no Four Tops, or Temptations and the like. The media thing needs to be examined a bit more.  This machine argument just doesn't get it I am afraid.  What a stifling thing it will be to ongoing development.  \r\ngene"

One example is the doctrine of survival: if it is impossible to make a correct unambiguous decision about which of two people died first, the oldest person is arbitrarily declared to have died first.  This curiosity is an unfortunate but necessary part of the Western judiciary system, which requires facts, sometimes above truth. The institution of software patents is not legal fiction then, but a short sighted malfeasance resulting from a Legislature, Executive Power, and Judiciary, that have a collective ignorance of technology and software.
