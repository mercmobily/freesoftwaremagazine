    body: "We commit our fried Eeyore to the oblivion of parts and recyclery. He served us well, providing content, and saving data. Maybe he was just a little shy or groaned to a finish. It was his personality we will miss so much. Groaning along chugging bits of data through Rabbit's fields on his way to Piglet's house. Tigger always bouncing and gay said this about our old friend, \"are we talking about the character or the computer?\". He was loved by friends and admired by viruses. Eeyore was survived by two thumbdrives and his older brother Eyesore, the toaster-like external drive. May his parts be recycled by the great maker.\r\n\r\nHe was last seen floating downstream in a raft filled with burning arrows."
