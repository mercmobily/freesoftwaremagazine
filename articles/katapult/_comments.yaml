    body: "It looks like <a href=\"http://raphael.slinckx.net/deskbar/\">Deskbar Applet</a> is the equivalent for GNOME. It does a whole bunch of things: you can run commands; it'll search your emails, files and folders, web bookmarks, history, previous web searches and delicious bookmarks too; open up web pages; interface with beagle; do dictionary searches; switch windows. I have mine bound to Ctrl + Alt + End.\r\n\r\nBecause it does window switching I can find windows I already have open too, which means I don't need a the task bar at all. If I minimise a window by mistake I can use deskbar to get it back by typing the name of the app.\r\n\r\nIt would be good if it had a calculator like Katapult. And, if the spell function Katapult has is built-in and doesn't require you to be online, then it would be a feature I'd like built into deskbar too. I don't know whether it has an API for plugins but I can imagine that would be a good way to get these other features built in."

    body: 'I had katapult, but never found it all that much more useful than alt-F2, switching songs in amarok didn''t work for me, and I don''t use amarok anymore (moc player instead), so it wouldnt matter.  I''ve got specific hotkeys for a lot of programs, and I just don''t like the idea of some other app sitting the background using system resources (have the same feeling about kerry beagle).  On the other hand of course what are system resources there for, but to be used up?'

But as ''Anonymous Visitor'' pointed out, Alt-F2 is about the same as far as usability. Although the build in calculator / spell functions are pretty cool. Sort of like Google. But not as...robust?'

    body: "The reason Microsoft's program manager isn't very popular is because most windows uses aren't that bright. Power users use Linux and want to customize every aspect of their environment, windows users on the other hand want Microsoft to create the experience for them so they don't have to think.. \r\n\r\nThis is a great app, I love it when people post screen shots so that we can see what is going on.
