    body: "For some time, I've been looking for an introduction to the cosmos for the uninformed lay person - starting with the solar system, then expanding to our galaxy's star system, topped off with models of the known universe (note: empahasis on the 'known' part) - showing the arrangement of galaxies, major bizarre objects, perhaps.   A Part 2 would be an introduction to some of the current bleeding-edge projects underway to grasp a better understanding of these phenomena - from gravity-detecting probes to the gargantuan atom-smashing machine under construction in Europe!  (There was a super documentary on its construction recently on TV).\r\nAny suggestions?  links?  CD/DVDs? \r\n\r\nMany thanks!\r\n\r\nHarry K.\r\nOntario, CANADA"
