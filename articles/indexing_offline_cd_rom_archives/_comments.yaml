    body: 'I took the time to copy to a local hard disk the contents of every CD I had ever burned. As I sorted the content into a directory hierarchy, I realized that my prior methodology was faulty: I would archive a folder daily until it totally filled a CDR, then I''d delete the folder and start anew. In other words, some early files were burned to CDR multiple times; some later files only got burned once. After I restored all the archived CDRs, after I sorted the files according to topic, weeded out all the files I no longer needed (BIOS flashes for Slot 1 motherboards, manuals for machinery I no longer own, etc), after I resolved that there were no duplicates, I then made a master archive of 11 CDRs. The rest of the original incremental CDRs have been destroyed.'

    body: "\"I took the time to copy to a local hard disk the contents of every CD I had ever burned.\"\r\n\r\nYeah, that's a remarkable thing. That's usually practical nowadays, with such large hard drives readily available.\r\n\r\nI certainly considered doing this with the collection of CD-ROMs I indexed above. Of course, the whole point of making the archives was to put stuff I didn't really need cluttering up my disk into offline storage (and by \"cluttering\" I mean \"providing confusing forests of files that get in the way of the ones I'm trying to find\", not \"consuming too much disk space\" as I would once have thought).\r\n\r\nHaving really cheap disk space changes your perspective."
