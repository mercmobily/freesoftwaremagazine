Python scripting in Blender seems like a natural interest for me, as I'm interested in both Blender and Python. I really enjoyed reading this book on the subject, and the examples were certainly interesting. However, there is one small problem that I didn't realize until after I had read it: Blender's Python API changed a lot in the major re-write that accompanied the transition from Blender 2.4x to 2.5x. This unfortunately is going to make this book dated a lot sooner than you might expect. So, while I do think it's a great book, I might have to recommend waiting for a version updated to Blender 2.5x.

The book presents a series of examples showing more and more complex tasks in Blender's Python API. Like most of the Packt books I have read, it is very concise and targeted. This is a fairly thin book, but I find that to be to its credit. It's easy to read and very quickly presents a lot of useful ideas.

Clearly you will need to have some prior understanding of both Python and Blender to find this book useful. It's about combining them, not explaining how to use them independently.

Of course, both Python and Blender are popular free software tools, so this is very relevant to free software users, particularly if you have artistic interests.

## Pros

* Well written
* Concise
* Good examples

## Cons

* Covers a somewhat outdated version of Blender
* Does not work as an introduction to either Python or Blender

## In short:
