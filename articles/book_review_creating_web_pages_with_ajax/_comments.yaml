    body: "Its my opinion that this book was targeted at the right audience to begin with though. I frequently find myself frustrated as a developer at the materials available for exploring new technologies and ideas, but have to remind myself each time that at the end of the day what makes the web a valuable place are the millions of non-tech users clicking around. \r\n\r\nBrowser biased or not, a majority of users still use IE. Also biased or not, the idea of more gui developers learning front end application of technologies such as the term AJAX brings and uses, the faster its concept will be developed and made mainstream.

    body: 'This is a great book for Web programmers who want to learn Ajax and want to become freelance designer. There are tons of code samples and lots of programming. It is not a book for beginners. I liked it, but I''d already read like four Ajax books before I picked this one up and I can write OO code like Java and C++.'
