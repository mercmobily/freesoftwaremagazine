Don't understand me wrong, I'm on the same spot of the political spectrum as you are, but I also know their fascination with corporate products and free enterprise. A highly successful company like MS appeals to them on an almost emotional level. Still, bad products are bad products. When they are able to overcome these emotions by simply looking at the facts (pun intended) we've made a significant victory.\r\n\r\nHans Bezemer"

Given their kowtowing to big business and American imperialism, their opposition to civil liberties since they took office - not to mention the \"cash for peerages affair\", or my memories of Tory government - I'm not exactly hopeful the Tories will be any better."

    body: "While any increase in the number of users of free (as in freedom) software is good for the free software community, the Conservatives haven't mentioned freedom as a benefit of using free software at any point here. The only benefit they're talking about is cutting the cost of getting hold of the software. If people are oblivious to the ideals of software freedom, they're not likely to stay with the community, as they can easily be tempted back to proprietary software if it can offer them a technical advantage, or it has a lower 'total cost of ownership'. I'm hoping that one of the major political parties in the UK will talk about software freedom at some point in the near future. I think the Green party might do a bit, but they have nowhere near as much influence as the Conservatives, and as far as I know they don't have a single seat in the House of Commons.\r\n\r\n--\r\nGNU - free as in freedom"
