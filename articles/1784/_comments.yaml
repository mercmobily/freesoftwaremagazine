    body: 'Personally I was looking forward to stealing a tank and personally fighting the Dept of Water and Power. The DWP would have wiped out my commune and I would be finding strange individuals who dressed in archaic fashion but had the ability to hack a tank and modify it without prior vehicle maintenance experience. As we all know just by living in a post-apocalyptic world we will gain skills not afforded to us in mere normal circumstances. Maybe the radiation from all of the nuclear fallout will allow our minds to absorb technical manuals without reading them. If they still exist as well. Then the mutated [insert man-beast species here] are really commandos and will take care of us in between musical numbers featuring their creator. Ah... what a world that would be. We could call it "Mad Tank-loving Post-Nuclear Beyond Red Dawn Because I Learned to Love the Bombville". Patrick Swayze, Mel Gibson, and Max Von Snydow would be our council of elders.'

    body: "My mum told me \"Life begins at forty\" when I turned forty last year.  As corny as it sounds, I swear it was one of the most useful things she ever said.  So I've done nothing that dramatic, other than enjoy, yes, I said \"enjoy\", that's a few steps up from dull old \"accept\", my changing body.  Despite the images that would surround me if I paid attention to the media, I feel okay about getting older.  \r\n\r\nReal life does being at forty.  You should see my garden this year...\r\n\r\nTake care\r\nJulianne\r\nwww.urgentartwork.co.nz"
