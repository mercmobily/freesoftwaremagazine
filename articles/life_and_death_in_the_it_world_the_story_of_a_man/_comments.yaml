    body: "With or without the murder, it's a pretty appalling story. It's sad to find something like this happening in our community, but of course, it is an inevitable result as the community grows and becomes more inclusive. Eventually something bad is going to show up.\r\n\r\nWe like to think of our community as idealistic and equate that with moral and peaceful. But the truth is that ideals, peace, and morality don't always travel together.\r\n\r\nI don't like to comment on a court case when so much is on the line, but this does look pretty bleak for Reiser, even though the evidence is circumstantial. All I can say is that I hope justice is served in the end, but it gives me a shiver. I can imagine a <em>lot</em> of different stories that would fit the available facts. I would so hate to be on that jury, obliged to pick which fits best, with lives and futures hanging on the choice.\r\n"
