It's a story I learnt about from [FSdaily](http://www.fsdaily.com/Other/Hans_Reiser_Once_a_Linux_Visionary_Now_Accused_of_Murder/)

It's a story of life and death.


<!--break-->


It's a story of love and hate.

It's a story of talent and genius.

It's a story of friendship and trust, and things that made them fade.

It's a story of violent videogames and nightmares.

It's a story of sadomasochism and drugs.

It's a story of money that ran away.

It's a story of suspect, police, lawyers and jail.

It's the story of the fear of a man that the police were actively surveilling.

It's a story of a woman that mysteriously disappeared, and of a man accused of killing her.

It's a story of two kids that were taken away from their father, and he doesn't know where they are; two kids that have suffered too much, and probably still do.

It's a story that I didn't read in its entirety, for it was filled with too much sadness and cruelty for me to stand.

**It's the story of Hans Reiser**, the talented inventor of the Reiser File System.

Until a jury makes its verdict, everybody can make their own stories based on the facts that are evident. A lot of different ones are available, from the easiest (Hans Reiser killed his wife and found a way to hide most of the evidence and her body) to the most elaborated (Hans Reiser is innocent and them victim of a plot by his wife that has fled back to Russia, staging her murder, and who has reunited with her children there; she will then rejoin with her lover once Hans Reiser has been condemned).

As far as I am concerned, I let others talk while I listen in silence, knowing that the presumption of innocence is always the best thing. So, if you'd like to give your opinion on the story, just comment below.
