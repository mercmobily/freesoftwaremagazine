The GUIs thare are put on top of MPlayer are often quite poor.\r\n\r\nIf you know how to use MPlayer it can be very powerful and works well without an unnecessary GUI getting in the way.\r\n\r\nMPlayer is designed for the more advanced user. There are better alternatives for the average user, but if you know what you're doing nothing beats it."

(Press \"v\" in codeine to get video settings with brightness, contrast, etc.)"

    body: "In the review, you really missed other important media players like Kaffeine, KMplayer etc. \r\n\r\nFor me, Kaffeine's interface is best comparing that of all other media players available for GNU/Linux. At the same time I expect more and more work from Kaffeine developers to make its interface more easy to use. Kaffeine in default is based on the popular Xine libraries. It gives an option in its menu to adjust the 'Xine Engine Parameters'. I think the area where the Kaffeine developers has to work is to simply these configuration options especially the 'media device' settings where they are representing the CD/DVD devices using the unix name (eg:/dev/hdb etc.). It would be better if they can represent these devices in detailed manner (eg: SONLY CD/RW etc.) like Totem. And other things which I would like to see is the placement of 'sound equalizer' and 'video controls' beside the play control tool bar since these options are not visible at a glance. KMplayer's strength is that it is based on the high quality Mplayer libraries. But its interface has to grow a lot. \r\n\r\nI think after the arrival of different front ends (both Qt and GTK based) to both Xine and Mplayer liraries, the XineUI and GMplayer become less tried now a days."

    body: "Totem is great but I think Mplayer would have deserved more feature points than just 7 compared to 9 given to Totem. Mplayer features may not be as readily available as in Totem, but there are lots of them. My experience has been that of all the media players for Linux, Mplayer has been the player that has played practically any media I've thrown at it, whatever the format. An example, with Mplayer it is possible to watch ISO files for video DVDs even before they are burnt on a CD/DVD. Try that with Totem.\r\n\r\nwhat Mplayer, mainly a video player, achieves with its rather small GUI, is unobtrusive interface that doesn't fill the screen with unnecessary buttons and bloatf, but gives room for the actual video instead. However, all the options are still there, available via a right mouse buton menu, should you need them.\r\n\r\nI used to have lots of problems with Totem, especially when used with Gstreamer 0.8, and that has been one reason why I have preferred Mplayer instead. However, this article did convince me to try Totem again with all sorts of media material - and, I was positively surprised. Totem has indeed developed a lot, and may also become my other favorite video player for Linux, so thans for the hint. \r\n\r\nHowever, I don't quite agree that Totem would be so much more userfriendly than Mplayer or VLC. For example, it may be a bit too difficult and unintuitive to, for example, go to a fullscreen video mode in Totem. Ok, not that difficult to find that option though, but when I first time tried it, I remember to have tried several things in order to get the still visible and somewhat irritating big controls beside the full screen video to disappear to the background in order to see the video only - before I finally got it that there is just a time period of some seconds after which the controls hide themselves automatically (maybe too long, should be a bit shorter?). (Ok, not that difficult now when I think about it, but it wasn't obvious the first time, at leat for me...) However, it is quite nice from usability point of view that you get to see the controls beside the fullscreen video again simply by just moving your mouse, and don't have to remember some cryptic key codes (like ctrl+F or F) for it."
