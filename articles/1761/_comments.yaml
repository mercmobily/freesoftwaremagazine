    body: "[Lazily copying and modifying a comment I made on the Danijel Orsolic article at nuxified.org.  That conversation might be over with but this one is new and fresh :-) ]\r\n\r\nI like the points raised here and in the Orsolic article about advanced users moving over and perhaps taking others with them, although I have my doubts.\r\n\r\n[Begin recycling.]\r\n\r\nI appreciate Danijel's optimism about Free Software and Free Culture.  I agree that they will prevail, it's just a question of when.  Will it be sooner, or later, after a DRM and patent-stifled dark age?\r\n\r\n[Removed rehash of my own attempt to move to GNU/Linux.]\r\n\r\nWhile I certainly promote free software to \"non-choosing\" kinds of people I know, even if I was competent in using GNU/Linux I would have some reservations about getting them to use it.  Are they willing to deal with hardware challenges caused by lack of drivers or whatnot?  For example, \"Why doesn't [Product X] work on this new operating system you've installed for me?  I really need [Product X].\"  Where Product X might be software or a hardware device.  There may or may not be substitutes that they can use.  For myself, I'm prepared to make many tradeoffs to get to a free OS and free applications.  Others may not be.  (Unless we can convince them why they should, of course.)  For example, there is someone I know who is very technical and informed about these issues but is held up from completely switching over because he can't find a free financial program that integrates with his bank.  \r\n\r\nI know these things can be overcome if we continue to have the freedom to make software that interoperates, but this is where my fear of a drm/dmca/patent dark age comes in.  The companies threatened by free software have money today to buy politicians and laws protecting their monopolies.\r\n\r\n[Additional thought, just for FSM.]\r\n\r\nIf we're allowed to continue competing with proprietary software and monopolies, we'll be fine in the short and long term.\r\n\r\n[I didn't say it was a particularly original or earth-shaking thought, but I have to wrap up and get my own FSM entry done for tomorrow or I'll be in <em>big</em> trouble!]\r\n\r\n----\r\n<a href=\"http://www.movingtofreedom.org/\" title=\"Freedom is on the March!\">http://www.movingtofreedom.org/</a>"

New generations will probably be much more accepting to the idea of tinkering and less fearful of the source than current generations which all works against the old powers that were. And that means geeks and mainstremers might just be blending together.\r\n\r\nAt this point sure alot of cool kidz depend on geeks for their cool tech stuff to remain cool. ;)\r\n\r\nBtw, Scott, I replied to you on Nuxified. :)\r\n\r\nCheers\r\nDanijel"
