As mentioned above,  you can add the details of your group and whatever announcement you wish to make on the iCommons <a href=\"http://wiki.icommons.org/index.php/ICommons_Lab_Report\">wiki</a>. \r\n\r\nAt the end of the month, the contents of this page will be published as the FC Newsletter for September.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nTim\r\n\r\n"
