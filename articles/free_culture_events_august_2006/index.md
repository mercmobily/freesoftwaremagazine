Welcome to the August 2006 edition of the Free Culture Events Newsletter - A joint project of [Free Culture UK](http://www.freeculture.org.uk) and [iCommons](http://www.icommons.org). Free Culture is a movement that extends the logic of free software into the world of art, advocating free creativity, sharing and appropriation. There will be thousands of events with this ethos going on around the world, but the listings below are brought to you by activists and advocates of the free culture movement. You can add your events and reviews to this newsletter on the [iCommons wiki](http://wiki.icommons.org/index.php/ICommons_Lab_Report).

## Free culture in the news

**Public Domain Works Database launched**

The Public Domain Works DB is an open registry of artistic works that are in the public domain. It is focused on recordings (and their underlying compositions) because a term extension for recordings is currently being considered in Europe. In the future it will expand to cover all types of cultural works which are covered by copyright. The DB is a joint project of Free Culture UK and the Open Knowledge Foundation.

**Call for volunteers:** Assistance is required in two main areas:


* Development of the public domain works database and web application. At present we are working on doing a first iteration using python and the django web application framework. Help is required with all and any of the coding, web development, testing and usability.
* The obtaining and entry of data on works. We need to find and enter data on recordings along with information on the artists who authored and performed those works.
* [More information](http://www.publicdomainworks.net/).
* [Participate](http://www.publicdomainworks.net/participate).
