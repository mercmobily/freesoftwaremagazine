    body: "I've got a copy of Gagne's Moving to Linux 2nd, which is a superb introduction to Linux and the KDE desktop. I suspect that Moving to Ubuntu will prove to be equally as good. Gagne's style of writing is perhaps the most impressive thing to the book. Clear, concise, and witty. There is no sense of condesention or techn-babble. I think that I'll add this to my wish list just to have it as a reference.\r\n\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nAlisdair (but you can call me Al)"
