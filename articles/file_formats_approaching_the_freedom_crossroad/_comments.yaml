What you mean by hard-drive file format is quite ambiguous. Each application that uses the hard-drive may have a different file format. The point is of standardising file formats so that other applications can access data as well.\r\n\r\n2. <cite>also Microsoft, NEVER restricted anyone from opening and viewing their documents.\r\nyou can download FREE viewers for all MS office file formats, then you can cut and paste them into what ever you like, and as you said, the text is still there is still the same, its still 100% accessable.</cite>\r\n\r\nHow can I view a MS Word document WITHOUT EITHER MS Word OR MS Word Viewer?

The word \"Office\" has been in common use for much longer that Microsoft has. Also, it is OpenOffice that pioneered (and now Microsoft is trying hard to \"copy\" this) open file formats in XML. Microsoft is trying all they can to prevent adoption of this standard all the while pretending to offer comparable \"open\" XML formats for Office - which is not even 100% native XML and needs to embed binary ActiveX components to work!!\r\nOpenOffice only offers compatible features in MicroSoft Office. MicroSoft Office did not invent those features - they existed in WordPerfect much before Microsoft Office. That would mean, by your standards, that Microsoft copied WordPerfect.\r\n\r\n4. <cite>its so annoying to see the open source and free software people resort to \"attack politics\" to get ahead, it does not work in \"real policics\" to constantly degrade the \"enemy\" sooner or later your asked to \"put up or shut up\". so far, u cant \"put up\".</cite>\r\n\r\nThe last I checked, it was Microsoft that was attempting to put a knife in the back of Linux by signing a non-agreement with Novel about MS IP in GNU/Linux. Thats pretty rich coming from a company whose OS is the bastard off-spring of OS/2 and BSD. It is in fact annoying that Microsoft lovers close their eyes to the millions of features (and code) copied from other, more innovative systems/organisations. \r\n\r\n5. <cite>im sure there are hundreds of old linux binary files and would not work on todays linux systems, giving you exactly the same problem, with applications not able to read older file formats. no big deal. IF your software provider provies you will the support you required. (by chance MS does). not sure about GNU/Linux !!!</cite>\r\n\r\nThe last time I checked, big corporates like Microsft and Oracle were rushing forwards, making stupid statements and even more stupid deals (Microsoft + Novel) to provide \"enterprise support\" for Linux. All this while genuine, high quality support has existed from RedHat, Canonical and other Open Source companies. These OpenSource support companies actually provide high quality support as opposed to the low-quality (many times non-existent) support provided by Microsoft. And the GNU/Linux Free Software/OpenSource Software community is very helpful to anyone that posts legitimate issues. See this for ratings of support quality (the study is independent and conducted by CIO Insight):\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.redhat.com/f/pdf/sec/CIO_research5_1205.pdf\">http://www.redhat.com/f/pdf/sec/CIO_research5_1205.pdf</a>\r\n\r\nTo sum it all up, this article is quite on the mark. Your statements on the other hand are pure conjecture with neither facts nor figures to back them. In fact, some of your statements clearly indicate that you do not even understand the issues addressed by this article, thus making you and your statements the joke."

    body: "<cite>I mean,, \"OpenOffice.org\". why the word \"Office\", i guess you thought it was a good name to use, (even though its used by microsoft,), or is it to try to make people think its a comparable product?</cite>\r\n\r\nThere were office suits before MS was in that business. Office is not even a term invented by MS. An Office Suite is just generally a suite of programs that are mainly used by workers at the office. MS has not more right using this term than anyone else, including Open Source developers. For more info on office suites, have a look here: <URL>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_suite</URL>\r\n\r\nIf any party emulates others, MS is the king in that. All great stuff that MS claims to have brought to the public were someone else's ideas remarketed (and admittedly that is a domain they are good at: marketing stuff and bringing it to the big public). But please don't make the mistake that because someone is doing something alike a well-known MS app, that someone is trying to emulate MS, as there is very little chance that it was MS that invented the app in the first place. Next you will be saying that Firefox is emulating Internet Explorer or what? Or that aero and secured admin account in Vista were MS merits. Please check your facts before making such statements.\r\n\r\nAnd yes, the fact that proprietary programs tend to make new formats that are unreadable in an older version of the software is a problem to many. Certainly when the new version needs quite some bucks to be acquired. There is a lot less of a problem with Open Source, since there is no problem acquiring the new version. Also an Open Source package will not create incompatible versions just to augment sales of a new version. And if there would be a problem like that with an Open Source project, it would be easy enough for any developer to create a solution and not be dependent on the party who created such problem.\r\n\r\n<cite>its so annoying to see the open source and free software people resort to \"attack politics\" to get ahead, it does not work in \"real policics\" to constantly degrade the \"enemy\" sooner or later your asked to \"put up or shut up\". so far, u cant \"put up\".</cite>\r\n\r\nAnd I find the trend that anyone who criticizes MS or other proprietary vendors are immediately taken for zealots that should not speak out and who's opinions are not valuable. If you don't agree, state facts why. Don't label the author for what he may or may not be. And if you want Open Source to put up, take a look at <a href=\"http://coulier.org/CMS/MDV_2007_homeusers_1_EN.html\">http://coulier.org/CMS/MDV_2007_homeusers_1_EN.html</a>. The author there has quite some good points for areas where Linux gives quite a bit more interesting functionality than proprietary stuff (like automatic updates of ALL installed software, easy software repositories, etc.).\r\n\r\nKind Regards   "

    body: "so your pals from Microsoft also owns all rights to the word \"Office\"? that's rich. oh, yeah, no one makes a cent from OpenOffice.org, so i don't see how there is real competition between the two.\r\n\r\nalso, you do understand that most free viewers that can read MS documents are usually done through reverse-engineering, don't you? the reason why formatting and other problems occur when viewing/editing MS documents on non-MS viewers/editors is that MS keeps documentation on their formats to themselves. otherwise, variants such as OpenOffice.org would be zounds better than your pet MS Office. and in some ways, it already is. i like the idea of the Open Document Format and how it doesn't keep people locked in to a specific software. OO.org may die some day, but there will be other suites and viewers capable of reproducing an ODF file 100% accurately, something that can't be said about MS documents should MS Office die in the future.\r\n\r\nhow much do you know about politics, anyway? i reckon it's either you have little knowledge, or you simply don't keep yourself informed enough to make proper assessments of situations. politics is when MS uses lobby groups and cash to sway court decisions and laws to be enacted. politics is when MS creates an ECMA-approved language and then tacks on proprietary bits that they never specified in what they submitted to ECMA, and so the open-source implementation lags by miles. what's more, politics is when they try to scare paid open-source developers with patent FUD statements. maybe it's time they \"put up or shut up\" themselves, eh? as it is, they're all talk, but are scared to reveal their actual allegations, maybe because they themselves infringe patents or ideas themselves, only they hide their code.\r\n\r\nwe all have different priorities in choosing stuff, and for some of us, choice is one of the answers. don't go around dissing our priorities just because we don't share the same priorities as you. if you even cared to try FOSS (which i'm sure you never did, but have the audacity to diss it), you'd know that some of the functionality that is implemented in your beloved Windows have already been in Linux/BSD/Mac OS for a long time. lark all you want about choosing the best tools for the job, be it FOSS, but it's quite obvious from your remarks that you never used any FOSS tools.\r\n\r\ndo you even know the difference between what a binary file is and what a file format is? obviously you don't. stop even trying to be authoritative about it.\r\n\r\nand to answer your last point, support is available for Linux. free or otherwise. and they answer more promptly to boot.\r\n\r\nwhere do you get these \"facts\" anyway?\r\n\r\nSERIOUSLY, IS IT THAT HARD FOR YOU TO GOOGLE FOR INFORMATION?"

    body: "This is what my daughter calls 'in the pudding'.  Just yesterday I was thinking about file formats and today I read an article about them.  What I was thinking about file formats is this:\r\n\r\nFor lay people, the discussion of file formats is often confusing.  How multiple programs are able to read the same files doesn't matter to them because they typically use programs that are designed to work together, such as office suites, and browser plugins/helpers.  And most of the time for most people it really is a non-issue.\r\n\r\nHowever, to take the big picture view of society's data, the issue of the openness of file formats is huge.  Most graphics file formats are open, so browsers, drawing programs, word processing programs, photo album programs, etc. can read them and display the same picture.  When file formats are closed, only developers that have access to the syntax can write programs to access that data, limiting its use and value.  But when those programs are used to create important data, society suffers.\r\n\r\nSince I often talk to lay people about computer industry issues, I use analogies.  Yesterday I came up with an analogy for file formats: human language.  File formats have a syntax that is understood by the programs that access the data in them, just as language is understood by people talking together.  And the analogy for closed file formats is slang.  Slang gives words and syntax a meaning is known only to the 'in' crowd using it.  Slang changes whenever the 'out' crowd starts understanding it.  Slang is fun (you can be 'in the pudding' ;~), and occasionally it becomes a part of the mainstream language.  But can you imagine if the US Declaration of Independence were written in slang?\r\n\r\nOpen file formats are like mainstream language, which is documented in dictionaries by people who analyze how language is used.  The analogy begins to break down (as analogies tend to do) when looking at open, proprietary file formats, such as PDF.  I guess that would be like the editors of the dictionary telling people how to use language, instead of just documenting how it is actually used.  This could result in the exclusion of words and phrases based on reasons such as misunderstanding of subject matter, political incorrectness, definitions of morality, etc.\r\n\r\nSo the main issues of file formats are: 1) their longevity and 2) who gets to define them.  For important data we obviously want the file formats to be long lasting.  And because of the diversity of society's use of information, we need file formats to be defined with input from all of the people using them.  Both of these requirements are accomplished only with open file formats.\r\n"
