    body: "Let's not forget the console/terminal mode IRC clients, such as Irssi, BitchX, epic, my favorite: WeeChat, among others.  For more advanced IRC users some of the non-GUI IRC clients may offer features or more extensible scripting capabilities.  WeeChat for example, supports Perl, Python, Ruby, and Lua scripts, as well as aspell integration; also supports updating the client without disconnecting from servers.\r\n\r\nAnother interesting project for heavy IRC users is Bitlbee, which allows for interaction with several popular IM networks via your IRC client."
