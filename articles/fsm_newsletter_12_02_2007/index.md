Hello readers, and welcome to Free Software Magazine’s fortnightly newsletter, keeping you up to date with all things free software! Enjoy!


# General announcements

Great news... Issue 16 has finally been released! It is jam-packed with excellent articles—it may be our largest magazine yet! We hope you’ll enjoy them! Also, for those of you who have been living under a rock for the past week, we have stopped releasing the PDFs of Free Software Magazine. While there was quite an outcry from some of our readers about this, it was a financial decision. So even though some of you will miss PDFs, the staff here at the FSM can put more energy into the magazine itself. And we are still catering to those of you who prefer to read the magazine without ads and offline—we are organising a “printer friendly” version of each article. It’s still incomplete, but it will beimproved over time so we can continue provide you all with the magazine you love!

A little bit of fun this fortnight to raise our spirits. If the candidates for the upcoming US election were miraculously swapped with some noted IT celebrities, which one would you vote for and why? You can also let us know who you think would be most likely to win and why too.


# Reminders

**Comments**

Your comments on articles, issues, and blog entries are very welcome. They provide other readers with insightful suggestions, further information, and the feeling that they are not alone. They also provide our authors with the feeling that they are being heard. Please comment wherever possible and **don’t forget to log in** so that you’ll be in the running to win the [latest book competition](http://www.freesoftwaremagazine.com/blog/1).

**Avatars**

Avatars are a great way of expressing your personal identity, whether it be a photo or an image that you feel represents the you you want to be. Read more about avatars [here](http://www.freesoftwaremagazine.com/node/1713). To add an avatar: log in, go to “my account” in the menu on the left, go to the “edit” tab and scroll down to where it says “Upload picture”. Now, hit the browse button, find the image on your computer that you want to upload and go to the bottom of the page and hit the submit button. That’s it; you now have an avatar image.
