First of all, apologies for the lateness of this one - mainly due to recovering from birthday celebrations.  So here's a present for you - a quick odd one out question.  Who's the odd one out from Cliff Richard, ABBA, Celine Dion and Lulu - and why? I'll leave it open for now - post your answers below...

As usual, answers to the previous crossword at the end. Most clues should lead you to words somehow associated with free software, but one or two "everyday" words have been slipped in to act as decoys.  The highlighted squares should lead you to a secret word.  Sadly, arranging for a duck to drop from your ceiling with cash in its beak is beyond my wizarding powers :-)
