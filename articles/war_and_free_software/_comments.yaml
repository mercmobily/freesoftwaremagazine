Surely there are more recent example than this.  No?  If not, then how can you draw that conclusion?  You may very well be correct, but you've not made the point with this reader.\r\n\r\n\\\\USlacker\r\n\r\n"

    body: "you honestly believe that places like China, Iran, Isreal and so on are going to develop control and command software using FOSS, and release this Source Code under the GPL ? \r\n\r\nYou've GOT to be joking, \r\n\r\nWhat's the FOSS community going to do with code the controls a missile, or a launcher system ?? \r\n\r\nI also wonder that if one of these Countries you mentions does make the source code available as is a requirement for FOSS, (the OPEN SOURCE bit).\r\n\r\nso the enemy can analysie the software's reponse and develop methods and countermeasures to exploit its design weaknesses.\r\n\r\nTHis is what happens now, all side continuously analyse the opposition system, for performance and for ways to \"trick\" or confuse it.\r\nThis techniquie is WHY defense keep their methods a secret. \r\n\r\nBut if you make these systems OPEN, you are giving the ENEMY a \"free kick\".\r\n\r\nWhat about \"ethics\" people ?? when i read this article, i get the impression that it does not matter about the human rights, or ethics of a country, they are \"OK\" as long as they follow the FOSS mantra. \r\n\r\nthere may be a place in the world for FOSS, but regarding FOSS above ALL ELSE, ie Country politics, etherics, human rights, or even WHAT SIDE THEY ARE ON. \r\n\r\nYou talk about China, and at the same time, you say how good they are (ethically) because they \"might\" be using FOSS. \r\nDoes not seem to matter that China will happily severaly restrict access to INFORMATION, let alone source code. \r\n\r\nwhy not you think China will make their source code available, and i guess you also think Google is great because they use FOSS, (except where it counts, ie they keep their search code proprietry).\r\n\r\nGoogle also work closely with the Chinese government to limit what its citizens can access on the internet. Nothing that might make China out in a bad light.\r\n\r\nas said, there may be a place and time for Open Source, and FOSS, but thinking its good for mankind, to make military control system FOSS is certainly not one of them.\r\n\r\nBut rest assured, the military does not use FOSS, as a an electronics engineer, and software developer for the military, also being Ex-military. \r\nI KNOW its just not true, \r\n\r\nThankfully the military has more brains, than to allow source code, methods and procedues, and system responses to become freely availbile to ANYONE, let alone the enemy. \r\n\r\nalso, finally, to write code for a system, you generally have to know HOW that device workds, and the military usually dont like Joe public having those kinds of details on their systems. Its called \"security\". \r\nits there becuase you usually dont want the enemy to know how you system work, because when you know how a system works, its quite easy to determine the easiest way to stop it from working, you only have to confuse a system ONCE and you've killed lots of people.\r\n\r\nHow to win friends and influence people, just tell them your working (FOR FREE), on a Iranian millile launcher system, writing software for them. \r\nBut its OK, just dont let you \"homeland security\" people know what your doing, they may just take a dim view of such practice.\r\n\r\nIf Bin Ladin was a FOSS hacker, he would be ok ? \r\n\r\nThere are some things in the world that should never be free or OPEN, \r\ntwo \r\nMedical equipment\r\nMilitary equipment\r\n\r\ni dont want a 13 year old hacking working on either of these systems, and am more than happy to ensure these systems are developed by \"GOOD\" programmers, and system developers, and not some schoolboy.\r\n\r\nand the FOSS boys are always saying Microsoft is the \"Evil force\" in the world. seems to me thats its the FOSS people who are willing to \"get into bed\" with anyone who'll give them a platform. \r\n\r\nIts sad that FOSS has to lower its standards, if there were ever any ethical standards to start with.\r\n"

    body: "> you honestly believe that [different countries] are going to develop control\r\n> and command software using FOSS, and release this Source Code under the GPL ?\r\n\r\nFirst, they would never release such code. Second, the sources need to be accessible only for derivative work of some other program under GPL, and only when the derivative program is being distributed or sold (yes, that's perfectly possible with GPL). Third, nobody is obliged to distribute the sources, if they are using the program internally. And if some program is not based on GPL-ed work, if it is original or proprietary work, there is no way of making the authors to release its sources.\r\n\r\nAnd most importantly, the code for \"control and command software\" wouldn't be released ever, even if this would be the violation of GPL - for obvious national security reasons.\r\n\r\nThat's why the whole situation poses a problem. Rest of your reasoning is not valid, sorry."

FOSS IS <strong> IS BEING USED </strong> in all the stages of weapons development, because its available, good, and FREE.\r\n\r\nThe point is not that software for command and control, etc should or would (it wouldn't) be released, but that FOSS allows for countries to get into the game very cheaply and reliably. The most important use of FOSS in weapons development is not within the weapons themselves but in the process of design, simulation, test, development and management.\r\n\r\nInexpensive, off-the-shelf, HPC clusters running Linux allows any country to design and simulate anything they want for fractions of the cost it used to cost the U.S. and Russia to create their war machinery at the height of the cold war.  So too with information storage and data mining, communications, and all the other support activities that have to be sustained to produce any product, military or non-military.\r\n\r\nThus, FOSS allows countries to get more for their money, and more that's already been tested, and proven to work, so they can concentrate more on the new stuff they want to develop.  This is where FOSS is making the biggest impact on weapons development, along with its increased use in actual weapons systems themselves (read the links).\r\n"
