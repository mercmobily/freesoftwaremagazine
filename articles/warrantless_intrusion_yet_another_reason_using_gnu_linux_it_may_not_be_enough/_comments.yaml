    body: "Nice piece and as a fellow Brit I am concerned by the issues you bring to light so thank you.\r\n\r\nWith regards a Community ISP the problem would be that somewhere along the line the data traffic has to flow through the major telecoms or other networks within the UK. That is - even if the ISP is based on the Friendly Society the traffic still goes through the hands that have been \"bought\" by the government (as you succinctly put it).\r\n\r\nAll in all I fear the horse bolted on this one a long time ago.\r\n\r\nta  \r\nRyan  \r\n- -  \r\nEquitas IT Solutions - fairness, quality, freedom\r\nhttp://www.equitasit.co.uk"
