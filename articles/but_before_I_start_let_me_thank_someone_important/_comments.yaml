I agreed with him on many levels, and still today can't see Evolution at work without thinking about him.\r\n\r\nGoodbye, Ettore.\r\n\r\nMerc."

    body: "Thanks Marco for putting up this article about ettore. I have recently switched from Windows to Ubuntu and never looked back (except for some of my official work which still cannot run on Ubuntu). \r\n\r\nWhile I'm simply amazed about all that I use on Ubuntu (Gnome, OpenOffice, Evolution, Drivel, Rhythmbox, Korganizer and Automatix to sample a few), it was wonderful to know about the man, who was the cause for some of these.\r\n\r\nI say \"Thank you\" to the Gods of all religion. God(s), please bless  the whole GNU/Linux Team and Free Software Community out there!!!\r\n\r\n- Ramesh, India."
