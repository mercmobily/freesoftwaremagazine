# Poll Results—What do you think about the (re)launch of Free Software Daily?

As you should all know by now, we’ve relaunched FSDaily and we wanted to know what you thought. And the results were very encouraging! 49% of you responded with “It’s a good site - I’ll probably have a look once in a while”, closely followed by 43% of you going with “It’s the perfect news site for me - I’ll be reading it everyday”. Aw. Thanks, guys! 2% of you decided that “I read news hubs, but we already have enough news sources; so, no thank you”, and 6% of you opting for “Other” - such as the RSS feed. Read more [here](http://www.freesoftwaremagazine.com/polls/free_software_daily) and stay tuned for...
