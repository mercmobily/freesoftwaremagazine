These toolkits are becoming very feature-complete and easy to use (== faster, cheaper S/W Development). By eliminating the JVM and the \"fat\" bytecode, they get better performance... which generally means that they can provide more features, or run on cheaper hardware. (step= 1 Less memory; step 2= slower CPU; Step 3= more \"Profit!!!\", and reduced hardware also helps battery life).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(2) It ain't gonna be mobile, but GTK+ provides a very broad set of GUI tools- and the code is fast, small, and visually clean. We're both aware of how, even with code generators, the enormous number of lines which Java needs to implement 'listeners' and other necessary makes it intimidating and slow to work with. But on the other hand-- (a) Java doesn't let you make and use invalid pointers; (b) Java is much more portable, if you can afford the performance hit [e.g., GTK+ doesn't run on Windows '98].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(3) Kinda interesting: AFAIK, Seamonkey/Firefox uses the GTK+ \"File Chooser\" in it's \"Open File...\" and Directory selection dialogues, at least on Linux. They originally had their own GUI for this, but abandoned it a few years back. Simply passing through everything, invoking the GTK+ modal dialog (and Window) to do this work eliminated considerable headaches from maintaining the home-brewed XUL/XPCOM implementation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOne possible conclusion: If you're doing a GUI element which XUL/XPCOM doesn't already provide and GTK+ does (such as local filesystem browser), go directly to GTK+ (or an equivalent toolkit) via it's API.\r\n\r\n<hr/>\r\n\r\n<strong>From</strong>: Clemens \r\n<strong>Url</strong>: \r\n<strong>Date</strong>: 2006-01-03\r\n<strong>Subject:</strong> Too much tech focus\r\n\r\n\r\nExcellent article from a tech perspective but totally lacking the most important part - deployment and delivery. I love XUL as a developer but its pretty much worthless for anything mainstream because of the poor market penetration of Mozilla.\r\n\r\nWe can continue dreaming though ;-)\r\n\r\n<hr/>\r\n\r\n"
