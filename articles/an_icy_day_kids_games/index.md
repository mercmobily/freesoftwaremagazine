Hi, it's B and G, the little kids in this house.  We've had a lot of ice lately.  The TV says we may even lose the electricity.  Dad said he needed to write his blog early this weekend.  But right now, he is walking around the living room and griping about writer's block.  He looks kinda funny.

So we sneaked in here to say what we don't like and do like about the computer.  The adults have said what they liked, now it is the kid's turn.


<!--break-->


What we don't like is not having enough time on the computer.  The adults in this house use it WAY more than we do.  How can work be more important than playing on the computer?  Do we really have to ride our bikes or play catch three days in a row?  We tried whining for more time, but now we use it even less.  What's up with that?  We think we should just ask for another computer.  We'll let you know how it goes.

Also, what is this deal about different sides to the computer?  Dad started going on about dual-booting and different operating tables (oops, that's operating systems).  Shouldn't it just work together?  Seems like whatever game we want to play, Dad has the computer on the wrong side.  C'mon Dad, get it right.

Off to the fun stuff, we'll take turns sharing a couple of our favorite games.  These games are for little kids, so no peeking by grownups.

B - One of my favorite games is [TuxPaint](http://www.tuxpaint.org/).  I love to draw and color pictures.  TuxPaint has lots of different colors and shapes to use for drawing.  You can also color some pictures that come with it.  But my favorite part is using the Magic effects.  You can create rainbows and sparkles and grass by choosing the right button.  The best part is the sound the brick's button makes.  Mom's face turns just as purple as the bricks.

G – I like [KBattleship](http://games.kde.org/kde_boardgames.php).  Placing your ships in the water is easy.  Push the big Shift button to change which way your ship points.  I really like when I sink the long ship.  The games are fast and I can play lots of games before getting kicked off the computer.

B – Another good game is Hexagon in [GCompris](http://gcompris.net/).  You look for a strawberry hiding in a field.  The box colors let you know how close you are to the strawberry.  Dark red is very close.

G – I also like [Potato Guy](http://games.kde.org/kde_kids.php).  I can make a neat fishbowl.  Or I can make a Potato person or a Penguin dress very funny.  Mom says this is why I'm not allowed to pick my own clothes yet.

We both like looking at the stars and planets with [Celestia](http://www.shatters.net/celestia/).  Spinning fast around the moon or Saturn's rings is neat.  Spinning fast around the kitchen causes Dad to be grumpy.  It's worse when he hasn't had coffee.

Websites with a lot of kid activities are fun.  Some of our favorites are [PBSKids](http://pbskids.org/), [Scholastic](http://www.scholastic.com/) and [MonsterTrucks.net](http://www.monstertrucks.net/).

Hey, because of this ice, we are going to be inside all day.  Why aren't we playing these games right now?  Gotta go!
