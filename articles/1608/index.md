Hey! I got a blog!

Hi everybody. My name is _Rosalyn Hunter_, and I've been using a GNU/Linux system exclusively since about 2001, so I've used a lot of software that hadn't reached version 1 yet.

Now a zillion people will tell you to switch to free software, but hardly anyone tells you how many programs there are to choose from, and when you do choose, some of them aren't very good, and some of them work... sort-of.

So if you use free software exclusively, like me, you have to spend time diving into a completely unknown program that may crash your system, or more likely just frustrate the heck out of you. Unless you are lucky, new free software usually comes with a manual that says:


>USER MANUAL (write a comprehensive explanation of the program here)...

and so youre stuck!

Sometimes learning to use new free software is like pulling teeth. You know that you've got to do it, but that doesn't stop the fact that it hurts like heck!

In this blog, I am going to explore this pain. This is my COMPLETELY LOST in free software blog. Feel free to post your own experiences too. Maybe we'll come to some kind of catharsis, or we might even learn something?
