    body: "Rights are <em>supposed</em> to be inalienable.\r\n\r\nI am disheartened to read that countries that protect inalienable rights could be considered to be in a 'worse' situation.\r\n\r\nWe are here, trying to restore the rights that copyright unethically suspends, that should be inalienable, and in the same breath such rights are considered in a negative light? Neutralising copyright is not a rights alienation or abdication, but a restoration, an altruistic nullification of one's unethical privilege. We should all aspire to have our countries protect our rights as inalienable, and abolish such privileges as patent and copyright.\r\n\r\nSo, the thing that's been interfering with everyone's cultural freedom all these years is the PRIVILEGE of copyright (it's not a right).\r\n\r\nPeople's rights (moral rights, etc.) do not interfere.\r\n\r\nThe public domain comprises all published works generally available to the public or in general circulation.\r\n\r\nIt could be divided into works enjoying copyright's protection and those that do not. Indeed, some people like to pretend that copyright protected works remain the private property of their copyright holders and cannot be considered to be in the public domain. These people reserve the term 'public domain' to mean works in the public domain that don't enjoy copyright's protection.\r\n\r\nDon't submit to this maximalist redefinition of the public domain as it constitutes a retreat to the ghettos. They aren't sanctuary but cultural exile, and still vulnerable to the predations of copyright. So, reassert the definition of the public domain as all published works, and reclaim them as the public's rightful property.\r\n"

    body: "Your objection appears to be just semantics:\r\n\r\nEither there are \"rights\" which are \"inalienable\" and \"privileges\" which aren't (your proposed terminology) or there are \"inalienable rights\" (which correspond to your \"rights\") and \"alienable rights\" (which correspond to your \"privileges\").\r\n\r\nBut these are statements about what the words mean, not anything about what the law should or shouldn't do. My usage is more consistent with the actual terminology used in writing law. Perhaps this is confusing you?\r\n\r\nThe idea that copyright (or copyright-like laws, defined under separate \"moral rights\" legislation) is an \"inalienable right\" is a concept in some European laws, and is embodied in the terms of the Berne Convention on Copyright. This is the problem I allude to in the column.\r\n\r\nBy treating what you call a \"privilege\" as what they call an \"inalienable right\", there is an assumption that materials are copyrighted unless proven otherwise. I agree this is bad. This is why it's bad for these \"rights\" to be \"inalienable\".\r\n\r\nHowever, that's the _law_.\r\n\r\nWe can whine about that, or we can act to fix it.\r\n\r\n_Political action_ may, in time, change things, but as we represent a pretty small political faction, and the opposition is large corporate interests with international pressure, an international treaty on their side, and billions of dollars to lose if we get our way, we can expect to have a pretty hard battle (and frankly, not one we can win any time soon).\r\n\r\nBut we can _patch_ the problem with legal documents like CC0 and the various free-licensing schemes.\r\n\r\nThat's the best way we can fix the situation in the near term. It also is the way we can demonstrate a working alternative, which is the only way we'll ever have the constituency to actually change copyright laws all over the planet, which is basically what you are agitating for.\r\n\r\nThis particular patch (the \"CC0 Assertion\") deals with the loss of the notice requirement.\r\n\r\nAs for the term \"public domain\", I'm sorry, but what it _means_ is \"work not covered by any copyright claim\". I don't see that it's useful to change such a term, unless you just want to confuse your readers.\r\n\r\nThe tone of your post suggests you are upset about something I said or about the CC0 idea, yet aside from quibbles over terminology, I can't find anything you disagree with. What's your objection?\r\n"

And yes, distorted even the language used in writing law.\r\n\r\nIf you adopt the distorted language of those who would assert their privilege to suspend the public's liberty, then you effectively concede to them at the outset.\r\n\r\nOne of the better acts to fix things is to fix your own language, to restore the original definitions. After that, then you can make clearer and more informed arguments.\r\n\r\nMy primary objection is to the insinuation that to be in a country where an author's rights were protected as inalienable could be considered a worse place to be that one where the author could sell or give them away.\r\n\r\nConsequently, I'd be interested in a more precise reference to the privilege of copyright being conceived or embodied as an 'inalienable right', for that would be a grievous error indeed.\r\n"

But words are tools, not just weapons.\r\n\r\nThe language I use characterizes the mode of thought of the people who wrote those laws, thus making it easier to understand how they got to be this way and how they are interpreted (these are the terms that Europeans use when describing their own laws, colored a bit by American usage, I admit).\r\n\r\nI prefer to write in a mode that encourages that kind of insight and understanding rather than in a mode which incites blind ideological outrage and disbelief. Certainly in this case, I think it makes more sense. I'm trying to explain how the CC0 system works and why it is necessary, not fire up a copyright-abolitionist rally. This is a rather detailed and legally-technical problem.\r\n\r\nI've heard the \"framing\" argument before, and there is some truth in it. But it can be carried _way_ too far, just like \"political correctness\". \r\n\r\nThe IMPORTANT THING here is that finding, using, and releasing material into the public domain is about to get easier (again). There _is_ an interesting political point, too, which is that the Creative Commons is doing more work on the \"free\" side of its license \"spectrum\" -- which has got to be a good sign.\r\n"

    body: "I wouldn't have posted in the first place, BUT for the wholly unnecessary aside implying that it was a bad thing for an author's rights to be protected as inalienable.\r\n\r\nThe whole modus operandi of the free software movement concerns undoing the unethical constraints of the transferable privilege of copyright and preserving this undoing via a conditional licence. This restores all other authors' rights to copy at the sacrifice of the copyright holding author's privilege. There's no need for this to require the undoing of any author's right of publication or their moral rights (not to be misattributed, the integrity of the work that is identified as theirs to be preserved, etc.), so whether they're protected as inalienable is quite irrelevant.\r\n\r\nI'm not aware of any law in any jurisdiction that holds the privilege of copyright to be an inalienable right.\r\n\r\nPlease carry on writing in the way you feel best communicates your ideas to your readers. \r\n\r\nHowever, please permit me to pick you up where you risk construing an author's privilege of copyright as a good thing because it enables particular licenses, and risk construing an author's rights as a bad thing because (if inalienable) they may conflict with particular licenses.\r\n\r\nAs for the CC0 'public domain'. I see little worthwhile in abdicating one's privilege, compared to the far more philanthropic use of the GPL to neutralise it and restore the public's liberty to a work. So, actually, I don't consider CC0 to be much of an important thing here at all. I'd be curious to know why anyone thinks it is."

    body: "Moral rights concern matters of truth, and arise from the right to truth.\r\n\r\nThis is one of three rights (life, privacy, truth) that preempt and constrain the fourth right, liberty, which is also constrained, unethically, by two privileges (patent & copyright) - until abolished.\r\n\r\nThe right to truth is a constraint on the public against its neglectful or wilful impairment.\r\n\r\nYou can say what you like, but there's no need to endanger life, violate privacy, or commit falsehood, e.g. misattribution, plagiarism, libel, misrepresentation, etc.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there's nothing ethically wrong in making copies of published works - which simply disrespect someone else's commercial privilege.\r\n\r\nSo, freedom of expression is fine, but not if it impairs truth. Thus it is possible to place someone else's work in an adverse or prejudicial context and by so doing misrepresent the author and/or the truth of their expression.\r\n\r\nThis is an ethical constraint on freedom of expression - because it rightfully constrains someone's expression against impairment of truth.\r\n\r\nAnd the right to truth is effectively inalienable (though truth is a collective right). You cannot sell the ability for others to misrepresent you. Of course, you can accept money and turn a blind eye, and so can many others, but no-one can claim they have a right to define or ignore the truth concerning your representation even if you'd prefer the money.\r\n\r\nSo, problems are arising when people fail to appreciate that freedom is not the fundamental right, when people think that nothing must stand in the way of freedom, that if anything does it must be wrong. Free software is software unencumbered by privilege, i.e. without the constraints of patent (against use of ideas) or copyright (against copying or derivation).\r\n\r\nWhen you write software you do not need to endanger life (deliberately introduce defects in flight control s/w), violate privacy (bypass someone's firewall to seize their source), or impair truth (misattribute or misrepresent).\r\n\r\nI would agree that because of copyright and the consequent proprietary mentality over published works, people often misinterpret moral rights as proprietary privileges, and confuse the definition of the former with spurious notions of an author's entitlement to control how their work is used. An author does not have a right to control how their published work is used. Rather, all authors are constrained against impairment of the truth concerning any other author and their published works. It's a big difference, but difficult to perceive if one mistakes moral rights to be additional proprietary privileges and simply lumps them all together."

    hostname: 68.93.224.4
    created: '1204735194'
    body: "I did have a paragraph on this, but perhaps it needs to be expanded. The Science Commons rationale for preferring to promote \"public domain\" style \"licensing\" rather than a copyleft free-license is based on two basic conflicts:\r\n\r\n1) Copyleft Conflicts\r\n\r\nThere's more than one free licensing regime out there. Science data spans more than one content type, and so there's a much higher probability of conflict between \"content\" licenses and \"code\" licenses.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, there's a lot of legacy data that you certainly don't want to shut out, that may be under an archaic license that can't be changed. Science data is supposed to be completely free to share (that's the whole point of the Open Access movement, and is an ancient ideal in the sciences), and so artificial constraints have unintended consequences (yes, the _motivation_ for using free licenses is to ensure that sharing remains possible, but in practice, the _actual licenses_ have a number of -- perhaps unavoidable -- faults that sometimes result in licensing overhead).\r\n\r\n2) Scope of Copyright\r\n\r\nIn order to be copyleftable, a work must first be copyrightable. But _MUCH_ of the data the Science Commons is interested in is just that: _data_. Facts are not copyrightable, only expressions of them.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, even where the expression is copyrightable (e.g. scientific papers), it's not the expression so much as the data contained that we are interested in.\r\n\r\nFor stuff that's on the borderline, it's probably safer to just release any expectation of being able to control its distribution. The choice of public domain fits this decision.\r\n\r\nScience Commons figured that it was better to avoid creating false expectations of an enforceable copyright (or copyleft), by simply acknowledging public domain status.\r\n\r\nThis is explained in even more detail by SC itself in the reference I included in the article:\r\n[Open Access Data Protocol](http://sciencecommons.org/projects/publishing/open-access-data-protocol/)\r\n\r\nThese reasons are obviously centric to Science Commons' mission, but there are actually a number of niche cases where releasing a work public domain makes more sense than using a copyleft.\r\n\r\nPD _always_ has less compliance overhead and less _legal risk_ than _any_ license, including all \"free licenses\", with or without copyleft. Even assuring correct _attribution_ imposes overhead. Science Commons has decided that it is better to rely on the \"community norm\" of correct citations than on an enforceable legal requirement.\r\n\r\nFrom a pragmatic perspective, if a work is completely paid for and completly \"finished\", then public domain or attribution-only licensing makes a lot of sense for the creator. You don't have to worry about special permissions in cross-licensing situations, and you don't really care if the work is appropriated into a commercial/proprietary product, because you haven't really \"lost\" anything (it's the improvements to your own work that you really want to recover through copyleft, and if the work is \"finished\", there aren't any. This is hard to imagine for software, but many artistic, literary, and scientific works can be thought of this way).\r\n\r\nFinally, of course, CC0 isn't just about the \"waiver\". There is quite a lot of scientific publications which are _already_ in the public domain, either due to age or, in the US, due to stipulations placed on taxpayer-funded research.\r\n\r\nNaturally, there will still be edge cases when the choice of PD will be less desireable, but that's going to be true with _any_ choice you make.\r\n"

There was a missed opportunity for CC to create a single copyleft licence just as liberal as the GPL - instead of a pix'n'mix confusion.\r\n\r\nSo, for anything other than software we may well be looking at CC0 + 'opproprium against illiberal re-copyright of derivatives' as the only option available until copyright abolition.\r\n\r\nPerhaps there could be an FC Norms module? That said \"The norms of free culture deprecate any privileged constraint on use of published works\".\r\n"
