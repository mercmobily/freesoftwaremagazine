6. **Louis Suarez-Potts: OOXML Has Zero Effect On ODF** --ODF as a default format was first adopted by OpenOffice.org (OOo).

Thus, this interview, which was conducted over a series of e-mails, with Louis Suarez-Potts, community manager, OpenOffice.org.

**The Bizarre Cathedral - 5** --By Tony Mobily and Ryan Cartwright. Latest from the Bizarre Cathedral. [Read more...](/articles/bizarre_cathedral_5/)

**Chapter 2: Project management and the GNU coding standards** --By John Calcote. In Chapter 1, I gave a brief overview of the Autotools and some of the resources that are currently available to help reduce the learning curve. In this chapter, we’re going to step back a little and examine project organization techniques that are applicable to all projects, not just those whose build system is managed by the Autotools.

**The 2008 Google Summer of Code: 21 Projects I'm Excited About** --By Andrew Min. The annual Google Summer of Code is upon us again. For the uninformed, that’s when Google pays hundreds of students and hundreds of mentors to work on free software projects, ranging from AbiSource to Zumastor. This is where great projects like the GDebiKDE installer were created. And this year looks even better than before, with 175 organizations and 1125 students. So today, I’m going to do a short rundown of some of my favorites. I can’t fit them all in (let’s save some trees!), but these are just some that stood out for me.

**Open letter to standards professionals, developers, and activists** --By Pieter Hintjens. You’ve read how Microsoft drove its tank through the international standardization process last year and this year, finally winning ISO approval for its legacy OOXML format. The OOXML event proved that we’re in a real fight, and that money and power can break down the existing polite rules and agreements that constitute the international standardization process.

**Chapter 1: A brief introduction to the GNU Autotools** --By John Calcote. I’m going to make a rather broad and sweeping statement here: If you’re writing free or open source software targeting Unix or Linux systems, then you should be using the GNU Autotools. I’m sure I sound a bit biased, but I’m not. And I shouldn’t be, given the number of long nights I’ve spent working around what appeared to be shortcomings in the Autotools system. Normally, I would have been angry enough to toss the entire project out the window and write a good hand-coded makefile and configure script.

**The Bizarre Cathedral - 4** --By Ryan Cartwright and Tony Mobily. Latest from the Bizarre Cathedral. [Read more...](/articles/bizarre_cathedral_4/)

**Autotools: a practitioner's guide to Autoconf, Automake and Libtool** --By John Calcote. There are few people who would deny that Autoconf, Automake and Libtool have revolutionized the free software world. While there are many thousands of Autotools advocates, some developers absolutely hate the Autotools, with a passion. Why? Let me try to explain with an analogy.

**Digital Rights Management (DRM): is it in its death throes?** --By Gary Richmond. In this opening salvo, I will reprise the technical terms and history of DRM and thereafter I will try to keep you abreast of the issues for computer users in general and free software in particular. Hopefully, I will in fact be chronicling the death throes of DRM. [Read more...](/articles/digital_rights_management_drm_it_its_death_throws/)

**Impossible thing #6: Freedom for all with the One Laptop Per Child project** --By Terry Hancock. For many years, there has been a growing concern about the emergence of a “digital divide” between rich and poor. The idea is that people who don’t meet a certain threshold income won’t be able to afford the investment in computers and internet connectivity that makes further learning and development possible. They’ll become trapped by their circumstances. Under proprietary commercial operating systems, which impose a kind of plateau on the cost of computer systems, this may well be true. But GNU/Linux, continuously improving hardware, and a community commitment to bringing technology down to cost instead of just up to spec, has led to a new wave of ultra-low-cost computers, starting with the One Laptop Per Child’s XO. These free-software-based computers will be the first introduction to computing for millions of new users, and that foretells a much freer future.
