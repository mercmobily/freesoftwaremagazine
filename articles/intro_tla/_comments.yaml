    body: "<strong>From</strong>: David Allouche \r\n<strong>Url</strong>: http://ddaa.net/\r\n<strong>Date</strong>: 2005-10-08\r\n<strong>Subject:</strong> It's dead, Jim.\r\n\r\n\r\nI only had a quick look at the introduction and conclusion of the article, and I did not see this very important datum mentioned:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTLA is end-of-life software. Its community has largely moved to Bazaar, and its developpers have scattered into the Bazaar2 and Mercurial communities. Tom Lord, GNU Arch's main author and maintainer has resigned and nobody has stepped up to take over maintenance of the software.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThough pioneering, the GNU Arch 1 model has some important flaws (most notably, a lack of distinction between naming and identity of revisions). Tom Lord started Arch 2, named revc. Just after the initial release, he rejected the first patch submission and resigned as a GNU maintainer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn case that was drowned in all those words, I'll make it clear: GNU Arch is currently unmaintained, and will likely never see a new release.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSwitching to Arch now, is very much a BAD idea. If you are interested in decentralised version control systems, I recommend you consider one of the newer general-purpose systems: Bazaar2 (bzr) or Mercurial (hg).\r\n\r\n<hr/>\r\n\r\n<strong>From</strong>: Gustavo Cordova A. \r\n<strong>Url</strong>: http://rangerelf.is-a-geek.org/\r\n<strong>Date</strong>: 2005-10-21\r\n<strong>Subject:</strong> Using TLA, then Hg.\r\n\r\n\r\nI cut my (scm) teeth on TLA, and can attest that it's an excellent piece of software, but like it's been said, TLA is at it's end-of-life right now; if you wish to stay on the GNU Arch bandwagon you can use Bazaar, which is compatible with TLA but with a different command structure, and is still under development mainly under the auspices of Ubuntu.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother alternative, which I took, is Mercurial (Hg), which is a distributed scm tool much like TLA, but with a very important distintion: it's written in Python, and runs equally well under Linux and under Windows; so, I can remotely update my projects vÃƒÂ­a http: easily and automatically, with the same tool everywhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHg is simpler to use than TLA, it's very quick about it's work, and you don't have to mess around registering archives, registering revision libraries, mirrors, and also it uses up less space than TLA, so it was a win-win situation for me; you might have other requirements, but it doesn't cost anything but a few hours to try it out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA good scm tool is indispensable these days, for anything larger than a trivial 10-line shell script.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGood luck :-)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n-gca\r\n\r\n<hr/>\r\n\r\n<strong>From</strong>: Dominique Orban \r\n<strong>Url</strong>: \r\n<strong>Date</strong>: 2005-11-29\r\n<strong>Subject:</strong> It's not dead\r\n\r\n\r\nAs of October 31st, a new maintainer stepped up for Arch.
