Dear readers,

As you know, we have been working very hard over the last 2 years todeliver the best magazine ever. Now, we need your help.

We are proud of what we achieved. We now have more than 750 articles onour web site, and all of them are released under a free license. Manyarticles are key references for Linux users and developers. Right now,we feel that we are flying.

However, as I said, we need your help. If you have a blog, or if youknow somebody with a popular web site, please ask them to have a look [here](http://www.freesoftwaremagazine.com/contribute/banners).

We have created a set of banner ads you can add to your site. Even asimple text link ad would be fantastic! In this case, all you have todo is add:

<a href="http://www.freesoftwaremagazine.com">Free SoftwareMagazine</a> 

somewhere in your site.

Adding a link to your site will help FSM and the free software movement in many ways: itwill spread the word, it will make our articles more relevant in searchengines, and will make our site even more established.

Please spread this open letter far and wide. Tell your friends about it - the more people who read it, the better.

Thank you for listening. And.. enjoy Free Software Magazine!
