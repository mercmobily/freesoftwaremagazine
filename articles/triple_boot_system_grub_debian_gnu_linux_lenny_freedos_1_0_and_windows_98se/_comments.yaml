    body: "I didn't know GRUB allowed you to remap a disk's partition at boot-time, it's good to know. I'd like to add some warnings and tips about Windows 98SE though:\r\n - as of June 2005, Windows 98 SE isn't supported nor updated anymore; no security updates are available, including updates to Internet Explorer or Windows Media Player. Active viruses probe those known unpatched vulnerabilities, and may trash the whole system. Proceed with caution, and I'd recommend disabling all online accesses after updating the system to its latest updates (there's 6 years worth of them, including some nasty ones)\r\n - don't try to install W98SE on a partition of 8Gb or larger! A bug in FDISK will trash all partitions that it can see, and even some it can't (the Master Boot Record gets a beating). Instead, you can create a 5 Gb partition, complete the install, and then grow the partition from Linux, by using parted. This is a bug in Windows' installer, not Windows itself.\r\n - Windows 98SE can be installed from any disk, even a partition formatted with only IO.SYS, MSDOS.SYS and COMMAND.COM: the install directory contains a basic XMS manager you can run at prompt; loading SMARTDRV.EXE will make for a much faster install. IO.SYS merely has to occupy the first disk sectors, after that Windows can install from the same drive it will run on. That will also allow you to discard the floppy/CD drive without remorse as the \"install media\" will remain on disk. It's useful for reinstalls, too.\r\n\r\nNow, another (non-Windows) tip:\r\n - a Linux system partitioning that I found to be a good compromise is to have everything on a \"system\" / partition (around 15 Gb), and a largish partition mounted on /home; this allows reinstalling the distribution (or any other distribution - I did a Mandriva-to-Ubuntu migration without much trouble this way, even though default UID and GID for both distributions differ) without touching user data.\r\n - if you decide to set up such a machine, it may be worth it not having to do it over again when the hard disk fails; however, if you get a new disk, check first that said disk can have a capacity limiter set up (typically, Pentium-2/K6 grade machines have a 32 Gb limit, Pentium-3/early P4/K7 have a 128 Gb limit). A BIOS update may remove said limitations, but more often than not they don't. And low capacity drives have gotten very hard to find: the lowest I can find now are 80 Gb, and they're getting rarer (although one could try setting up a Flash memory card with an IDE adapter...)\r\n---\r\nA computer is like air conditioning: it becomes useless when you open windows."

    body: "Thanks! I'm glad you found some new info. Multi-boot systems are rare enough that I thought it would be worth documenting mine as another example for people to look up. I have to say once again how impressed I am by GRUB and how much easier this was than the last time I tried it.\r\n\r\nIn retrospect, I'm not 100% sure you really need to do the partition-hiding when Windows is on `(hd0,0)`. You probably would if you were installing MS-DOS on the 2nd partition, but FreeDOS has no problem with multiple partitions (I think it is still subject to the 8GB limit, though).\r\n\r\n> Windows 98SE can be installed from any disk, even a partition formatted with only IO.SYS, MSDOS.SYS and COMMAND.COM\r\n\r\n_Well_, yeah, but...\r\n\r\nYou still need to find a bootable MS-DOS. It turns out that FreeDOS cannot run the Windows installer (it complains about insufficient memory, even though there is clearly enough -- I tried all of the provided EMS/XMS memory  boot options for FreeDOS, but none of them worked. I figure it's got to be a problem with the actual kernel, since the docs say it emulates MS-DOS 3.3, even though the CLI is based on MS-DOS 6).\r\n\r\nI finally just made a boot floppy using the Windows that was already installed on one of the machines, before wiping it (a small security hole, since it could theoretically have had a boot virus, but I don't think so).\r\n\r\n> the install directory contains a basic XMS manager you can run at prompt;\r\n\r\nNow _that_ I did not try: I suppose this _might_ make FreeDOS work with it. I'd like to try that some time.\r\n\r\n> as of June 2005, Windows 98 SE isn't supported nor updated anymore\r\n\r\nYep. My interest is in running legacy games and hardware-interface software anyway. Also, I really don't want to put any more money into Microsoft, so I'm not buying a newer Windows license.\r\n\r\n> Proceed with caution, and I'd recommend disabling all online accesses\r\n\r\nMy plan is to not even configure these systems for internet access. They're behind a firewall as well, and I should probably make sure they won't auto-configure (but I don't think they will).\r\n\r\n> after updating the system to its latest updates (there's 6 years worth of them, including some nasty ones)\r\n\r\nI probably should pay attention to your security updates advice anyway, though. Frankly, I've never installed a security patch before (They were still pretty new when I \"upgraded\" from Windows 3.1 to Debian \"Slink\" in 2000).\r\n\r\nBTW, when you say \"nasty\", are we talking about the hole that was patched, or the update itself?"

    body: "That's just it: the FORMAT.COM /S or SYS.COM commands can be passed parameters to tell them what are the system files to be copied over; as far as I know, this also applies to the FreeDOS versions. Now, if you can find the Windows 98 versions of these files (they can be found on the emulated floppy boot part of the install CD, or inside a .CAB file in the installation directory if memory serves me), you can thus use any system to set up a basic \"MSDOS 7.1\" bootable hard disk partition - on which and from which you can also install Windows 98! Voila, FreeDOS problem solved...\r\n\r\nI don't think the basic XMS manager can work with any version of DOS other than 7.1 (I don't remember it being present on Windows 95 install CDs).\r\n\r\nNot configuring these systems for Internet access isn't enough: they have to be disconnected from the Net, or at the very least, you have to uninstall TCP/IP, IPX/SPX and NetBIOS - well, in fact, all protocols: there are enough worms available out there to completely screw up a Win98 install even when doing nothing.\r\n\r\nSorry, yes, I meant the updates patched up some nasty issues - including stability and data corruption, not only network access.\r\n\r\n---\r\nA computer is like air conditioning: it becomes useless when you open windows."
