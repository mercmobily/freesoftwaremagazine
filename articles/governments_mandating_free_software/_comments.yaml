If someone depends on a proprietary program because the Free solution is inadequate, the user should then improve it themselves. The point of free software is that the user is free to improve it for their own purpose. If the user is incapable of doing the act of improving software,  they should hire someone else (a software developer) to do it on their behalf. This point is especially relevant to a government because it does very good things to the local IT sector."

Sure, some government mandates are necessary (not killing people is a good one),  but it seems a government can become inept either with too much power or too much work, the latter caused by too many mandates it has to enforce.  For example, how big is the documented US tax code now?\r\n     Also, when referencing \"the government\", to which governmental body are would this mandate be entrusted? Federal, state, municipal?  What if they all want to add a portion to the mandate, as occurs in traffic laws?\r\n     Economy and accountability should be the defining factors of how a government chooses their software, which in turn directs their choices in hardware.  Do it like a business must: Combine hardware, and software licensing costs, anticipated support costs, impact on current users (for example, how does going to open source infrastructure impact your 2000 PDA and Blackberry users), and look at productivity and ROI. Once the leader is identified, business sense should replace the need for a mandate. "

    body: "I agree with most all of what AC said in \"only the format matters\" (Tue, 2007-03-13 08:15);\r\nfor example I think governments do have some responsibility to avoid \"forcing\" the citizens \r\n(e.g. tax payers) to use certain file formats, for stuff like tax forms e.g., especially in \r\ncases where the use of those file formats might require using certain \"non-free\" software.\r\n   But another angle (which may not be intended to be included in this \"poll\" survey) \r\n(sorry if I am off base here), is that governments also play an important role in enforcing\r\npatent rights, copyrights, etc. . I think that the term of copyright should be very limited\r\nfor computer software -- e.g. something like 3 years on \"executable\" or \"object\" code, and \r\nmaybe 10 years on the source code.  \r\n(I also think that copyright terms should be more limited for books, magazines, newspapers, \r\n and music - but that is probably \"way\" off topic...).\r\n  As for patents, I do not know how to correct the craziness of allowing them for software\r\n\"ideas\".  The set of all possible \"paths\" that a person could take, in getting ideas for \r\nhow to do something in software (especially where standards create some commonality in \r\nthe goals for what the software should \"do\"), is not a tree!  It is much more of a graph, or \r\nwhatever they call it.  (There can be many ways of arriving at a given \"right answer\"!).\r\nI just think that for almost all software \"inventions\", the patent system is not the right\r\nway to protect (or \"create\") the rights of the author/inventor. . I prefer copyright.\r\n  In general, I think that any time DRM \"seems\" to be needed, to enforce legal \"rights\", \r\nthere may be some suspicion that the seller is asking too high a price for the widget.\r\nI think hardly anyone would go to a lot of trouble to evade having to pay 0.99 or a dollar\r\nfor a song, in digital format.  This to me seems like a case where the price is reasonable.\r\nAlso, we know of cases where someone will pay for certain Gnu/Linux distro's,\r\nmaybe mainly because it comes with a certain level of support.  Again, the price sounds like\r\nit is correct, and the possibility of sharing with neighbors is not a problem, partly since\r\n\"most\" of what they are paying for, is probably the support.  For example, the opportunity\r\nto ask questions, and get technical help.  Sharing with neighbors might even lead to an\r\nincrease in their interest level, and maybe (eventually), new potential customers. \r\n  On the other hand, sometimes movies and software packages show up on the \"black market\" \r\nquickly, and one might suspect that, part of the reason is that the prices are too high.\r\nI don't think governments should be \"directly\" involved in setting the prices, but I also\r\nthink that publishers should find some kind of distribution system, such that they can charge\r\na price that either is so low that (for most customers) it is easier to just pay the price, \r\nor else somehow set up a system that customers (/users) can live with.  I am not saying \r\nthat DRM should be illegal, but I think the government should be doing less to criminalize \r\ntransactions between two consenting persons, one of whom gets, (from the other), a copy \r\nof some bit string (or file), such as some software or data or \"content\".  I think if the\r\n\"owner\" of the rights wants to sue, it should be a matter for civil court.\r\n\r\nMike Schwartz    \r\nGlendale  AZ\r\nschwartz@acm.org\r\nMike.L.Schwartz@gmail.com"
