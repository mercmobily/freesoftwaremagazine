    body: "<p>Hi John,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First of all Marco is talking about the GNU/Linux version of Skype which is still in version 1.2.0.18. He makes this clear in the article:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\"Skype was acquired by eBay, they were pushing a lot of effort in the Windows version that quickly reached version 2.0 and 2.5beta, while the GNU/Linux version was stuck at the 1.2.0.18 released in October 2005. Skype didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t show any release plans for a newer GNU/Linux version, no new features were in sight but, above all, no bugfixes were happening.\"</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\"Now IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll try to do a feature comparison between Wengophone and Skype for GNU/Linux and review all points one by one. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll assign +1 (good) or +2 (distinct advantage) points to each competitor for each Ã¢â‚¬Å“yesÃ¢â‚¬? in the table.\"</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>The version you are using is for MS Windows. We choose not to use that OS here because it is not free software.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Which brings me to your question about Skype not being free: \"free software\", which this magazine is named after, does not mean software that has no cost. It means software that conforms to the <a href=\"http://www.fsf.org/licensing/essays/free-sw.html\">criteria</a> laid out by the Free Software Foundation. To sum up for you (in case you don't want to go to their site):</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Free software is a matter of the users' freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>I encourage you to read more of our articles here at FSM; we have a lot of articles that answer your question in more depth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Happy reading!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>-Dave</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    body: "Hi Marco,\r\n\r\nI think this was a good article. But you missed a critical point: Firewall traversal. As much as I like SIP,\r\nit is notorious for NAT / firewall issues. For example I was recently in a network where ALL outbound tcp and udp connections where blocked. In fact the only way out was through a SQUID web proxy. I'm curious to see how openwengo performs in an environment like this. Skype WAS able to traverse through this environment. It looks like openwengo has some support for this kind of thing. But, how well does it work?\r\n\r\nSecondly, lets look at the easiest solution. A home network with a cheap NAT router. In this environment using sip, how does the Wengophone send and receive RTP packets? In most environments it is forced to be relayed through an RTP relay server. Solutions like STUN, TURN, etc, only work so well, in most cases in my experience the RTP has to be hairpinned through a remote server. This has some severe scaling issues. How does openwengo perform here?\r\n\r\nAndy\r\n<a href=\"http://www.thevoipblog.org\">http://www.thevoipblog.org</a>\r\n"

    body: "From a free software perspective, i think the major point about Skype is not being not free software,\r\nbut being a closed service based on proprietary protocols.\r\n\r\nThe whole Internet Telephony business is organized around closed islands. Either with proprietary protocols\r\nor with SIP, but very few VoIP providers play the open game.\r\n\r\nThis doesn't make sense, because stricly speaking the actual service is not provided by the telephony provider (Skype, Wengo, or whatever) but by the internet connection itself. The provider just put you in contact.\r\nSIP is an open protocol that can work in an open environment, like the Web, where multiple Internet/PSNT gateway  service provider can compete against the same user base.\r\n\r\nInstead, each SIP VoIP provider (Woize, Wengo, Abbeynet, Free etc) try to keep the user base closed by providing closed client software, even if it use open protocols. The important point of OpenWengo may be having a role in opening this situation, but being financed by one of the player, i am skeptical.\r\n\r\nUnless the small players understand they have to open up and interoperate, the proprietary big player, Skype, will build a planetary monopoly that will us European ask to go back to national monopolies :-< ..\r\n\r\nMaurizio\r\n"
