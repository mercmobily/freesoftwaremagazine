    body: "Terms like \"free\" and \"open\" are so ambiguous that they will always be - er - open to abuse, mis-use and well-intended confusion.\r\n\r\nI'd be interested to know what you feel is an appropriate use of the word open in  a (software) product name?\r\n* Open standards adherance (or just compliance)\r\n* Open source code\r\n* OSI licence - partially or wholly\r\n* Based on FOSS products - e.g. OpenSuSE\r\n* Customisation at all levels\r\n\r\nFor example, what do you feel the \"open\" in OpenOffice.org refers to*? Its open source code or its compiance to (among others) the OASIS document standards? The truth is that the word \"open \" can and does mean any number of things and use of it in a product could be done for any number of reasosn as well.\r\n\r\nAlso I'm not sure your suggestion to reviewers would actually work in the way you ( and I ) hope it would. I've read reviews of products which seem to hinge on the fact that the reviewer doesn't like the company rather than the product. In those cases I tend to dismiss any negative coments about the product as the fruit of a grudge and I think I may not be alone.\r\n\r\nIf a reviewer were to overplay the fact that said company had mis-used the word 'open' it might be seen by some as petty. \"This product  name uses the word 'open' in a way that I don't agree with.\" seems a little picky to me. Thus the perceived objectivity of the review drops a little.\r\n\r\nPerhaps a reviewer could be kind enough to mention what the company means when they use the word \"open\" but of course this is not always possible because the companies are deliberately ambiguous in that information.\r\n\r\nRyan\r\n* I can't seem to find any definition on their site save one for the term \"open source\".\r\n"

    body: 'Yes, your comments make good points. What is open?I am just reacting to seeing the trademark logo after products that have nothing to do with open source starting with the word open. Perhaps there is a need for a trademark such as Ã¢â‚¬Å“open qualityÃ¢â‚¬? (if it not already trademarked) or INTEL sorry I mean open source inside.  Thus allowing anyone to use the logo as long as the product is based on open source license with standards based protocols. But then again that would generate unnecessary inertia and meddling. Therefore, I really have no good idea for a solution other than live, let live, and make better products.'
