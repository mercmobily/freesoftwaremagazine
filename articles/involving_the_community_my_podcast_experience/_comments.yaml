    body: "Those are some good points Jonathan. I really liked your first podcast, and I'm really looking forward to the one with Mark Shuttleworth, especially to find out if my question is asked. That's a very good point that simply citing practical advantages of free (as in freedom) software isn't necessarily the best way to bring as many people as possible to using GNU/Linux, even if that's all you want. If the 'open source' development model was really that good, all free software would be much better than its proprietary counterparts. GNU/Linux would be a lot better for normal desktop users than Windows or OS X, and I'd say it's still lacking some features for them. Freedom is by far the most important aspect for me, and proprietary software can't compete in that respect, though it can easily compete technically. Freedom is also something everyone knows and cares about (at least to some extent), and having it as the focal point is more relevant to the general population and less geeky than talking specifically about 'source code' as the main point.\r\n\r\nOn a different note, in response to 'Anonymous coward''s point, I would recommend using a free licence such as the CC-by-sa, GNU FDL or CC-by for your podcasts and blog entries, so that people can quote them and use small parts in derivative works. I assume you use that 'verbatim copying only' licence because the FSF does that. RMS's reason for it seems to be that you shouldn't modify a work of opinion because it distorts their viewpoint. I don't agree with that, because I don't think it does that as long as you make it clear that you've modified it, and don't represent your derivative work as the original. I'm going to email him about that when I get round to it. Personally, I'd like to be able to quote works like yours without having to either include the whole work or risk breaking the law. I've seen at least one article before where they wanted to quote something RMS said, but they couldn't without including the whole of a long article, so they just linked to it. I also don't want to have to rely on 'fair use' or 'fair dealing' to avoid breaking the law.\r\n\r\nHowever, 'Anonymous coward' has fallen into the common trap of treating all of the Creative Commons licences as one thing. I don't recommend you use \"a Creative Commons license\", because they don't have any particular freedom in common, and some of them are very restrictive. I definitely wouldn't like you to use the Developing Nations License, because I live in a 'developed country', so I wouldn't even have the freedom to distribute copies verbatim, commercially or noncommercially.\r\n\r\n--\r\nGNU - free as in freedom"

When people buy software, they''re not looking for some ivory tower of intellectual purity, nor are they (really) looking for something that''s visually appealing. First and foremost, they''re looking for their problem to be solved...whatever problem it is. In the case of an OS, it''s a matter of which one makes it easier to interact with their computer; in the case of digital media, which one allows them to enjoy their media experience without a lot of effort on their part. Once you''ve actually SOLVED their problem, <strong>then</strong> you can concern yourself with trying to be visually appealing.'

The other half wrote back once, and never responded again.  I only got one show out (with Phil Crosby, author of InstallPad), and almost interviewed the creator of Babelgum (until I found he was in Italy.  The costs of calling Italy would have been more than the income I would make).\r\n\r\nAnyway, good luck on the show!  May it not end like mine ;-)\r\n\r\n--\r\nAndrew Min"
