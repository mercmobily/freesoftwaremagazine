Here’s another reason why CC licensing can be effective—[it can help get games like this one](http://www.mcvideogame.com/game.html) out to the public so rapidly that plenty of people get the chance to play it before the hammer comes down. This game is seriously effective social and political commentary, but since it uses McDonalds’ trademarks all over the place, I’m sure it won’t last long. You’d better grab it while you can. You can also read [an interview](http://www.gamasutra.com/features/20060227/dugan_01.shtml) with the designer at GamaSutra.
