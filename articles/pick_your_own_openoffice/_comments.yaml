Just yesterday I spelled comma as coma and it accepted the spelling.\r\n* I worked w/ OpenOffice Base for about 300 hrs and find it terrrible. Simple things can not be done. You can't reorder fields in your database. So if you use a field to the far right often you have to tab over each time you need to make an entry waisting time. It doesn't support drag'n drop. The best thing I can say about it is it interfaces to so many databases.\r\n* In Open Office.org Writer\r\n  * I get a pulsing screen when I open large documents almost to the verge of crashing the application. I find you have to keep your documents to 35 pages or less to avoid it. Also some of my 100 page documents take forever to load and I have 500MB of RAM and a Duron 900 CPU\r\n  * OpenOffice.org's cut and paste from Firefox to an OpenOffice.org document requires time to warm up on some web pages before it can be used. I finally figured out a workaround: Cut with the mouse and paste with Ctrl+V.\r\n  * OpenOffice.org's cut and paste feature (while using the KDE Desktop in Ubuntu (not Kubuntu)) captures a few characters before what I want to cut from a web page and paste a few less characters than I intended when I insert it in an OpenOffic.org doc.\r\n  *periodically artifacts show up on the screen after doing a cut operation and do not go away unless you close and reopen the doc.\r\n  * Up until the last dot release the application crashed a lot although it generally recovered everything.\r\n* It's possible to open two instances of the same document at once if you click too often.\r\n* The scroll bar in the document jumps up a page or two each time an embedded Google ad is passed in a document.\r\n\r\nI could go on but I will save you the time.\r\n\r\nWhy do I continue to use it?\r\n* It has great large document features especially indexing and table of contents and I am writing a book/technical manual.\r\n* PDF creation is a snap and importing has been fine.\r\n* It's free.\r\n\r\nTo finish-up the OpenOffice.org team should stop and fix the bugs. Once they do they will have a nice product. I think your article was a little too much marketing."

Any spell checker worth its salt will do the same.</li>\r\n<li>Base is a very young component still. However, I should mention that in NO database qualifying for the name will let you reorder the content of a table! You may reorder the output of a selection, but not the content - SELECT * FROM Table ORDER BY (column to sort); - if you want to sort the contents of the actual file, then it's not Base you need, it's Calc.</li>\r\n<li>About Writer requiring time to load large documents: I wrote my 450 pages thesis on OOo. Yup, as I said (and as you said) it's slow to load. However it doesn't crash while loading (MS Office choked on the same document, around page 130, and THEN corrupted the file attempting to recover it)</li>\r\n<li>your cut and paste troubles and artifacts are strange - I have yet to find anything similar on all the versions and systems I've tried it on. On the other hand, I don't use KDE; the fault may lie in KDE's hand.</li>\r\n<li>OOo 2.2.0 is known for having a few bugs - that version was probably the biggest overhaul of the code base with the largest amount of commits at the last moment ever since 2.0.0. 2.2.1 will solve that really soon (rc2 is out).</li>\r\n<li>Opening several instances of a document in such a case is normal - don't click too fast. It also is useful when you want to compare a document you're editing to its last known good state without activating modifications monitoring.</li>\r\n<li>Google ads contain a lot of code - and OOo knows how to interprete HTML properly, so you may want to paste your text without formatting.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n---\r\nA computer is like air conditioning: it becomes useless when you open windows."

It has heavy requirements, as in it requires all KDE base files and several supplemental packages.

With Sun's version of OOo it has been very difficult to get third-party patches in and has been hard for newer developers to get involved.  Becasue of this, Novell took the code and incorporated it into ooo-build @ <a href=\"http://go-oo.org/\">http://go-oo.org/</a>.\r\n\r\nNow, most GNU/Linux Distributions use ooo-build to generate the version of OpenOffice.org into their OS (including Debian, Mandriva, Ubuntu, etc.).  To say that all of these features have been incorporated in a less than elegant fashion and because of this Sun has not incorporated the changes into the main branch is just plain wrong.

    body: "ooo-build was a project started a few years ago because it was, indeed, hard to include 3rd-party patches into Sun's main CVS. However, this has changed: ooo-build is now a test-ground of sorts for the biggest projects out there, but it has reached its goal: it is now MUCH faster to integrate 3rd-party code into mainline - ask those guys working on the AMD64 and the OS X Aqua build.\r\nNow, I think the ooo-build project was Novell's doing is a bit... exaggerated. Moreover, you can't base yourself only on what MM says: he's not alone. You can ask Pavel Janik, Eric Bachard, Sophie Gautier, and some others for more informations.\r\nA problem with QA is that, indeed, they ask for lots of specs - as it should be. Moreover, the build test tools, smoke tests and automated tests have been long outdated, but they have recently been improved, and most 'new' developers now enjoy the CWS system - which has been improved and better defined - as such, QA is getting a bit more responsive, while developer snapshots just work.\r\nAs it stands, Novell is working hand in hand with Sun to integrate their improvements with OOo's mainline in a 'proper' fashion - as in, following the OOo project's architecture, code formatting and QA guidelines. It results in a more gradual but much more robust and future-proof integration of Novell's improvements into OOo - otherwise, why would have Novell not kept including their patches in more recent versions of OOo? We're now almost at 2.3 on mainline, and Novell's version is still 2.0.4. Why? Because several of their improvements have been refined and integrated gradually in OOo's structure - while existing OOo subsystems have been modified and made more modular. In essence, this is what MM is saying.\r\nI'm not bashing Novell's build; on the contrary, it was a very nice and well polished first implementation of VBA and OOXML under OOo, but a project the size of OOo requires strict code submission guidelines otherwise you get... Microsoft Office 2000 (required SP3 to be made usable, and 3 years of extra development on a frozen code base to work).\r\nAs for the distros using ooo-build, it was true in 2005 - but since then, since ooo-build has been integrated in the main OOo development group of projects (or to be fair, became the standard structure of any and all new OOo development projects), it's not true anymore. For example, I have the latest ooo version (in 64-bit) provided by Mandriva, and it's tagged 2.2.0cvs20070323. Previous was 2.1.7cvs, and from development notes matched against OOo bug reports, it looked a lot like a 'vanilla' 2.1.0 build with some extra CWS integrated. A glorified development snapshot, if you want.\r\n---\r\nA computer is like air conditioning: it becomes useless when you open windows."
