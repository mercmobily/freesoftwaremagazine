I was excracting some text from a malformed exported SQL file that had some quoting problems. I was able to utilize a module from CPAN that allowed importing the records.\r\n\r\n    I've had it in mind to use Python to continue with that project. I guess I could still use Perl just for the import functions, but it's always nice to only have to deal with one tool.\r\n\r\n    I will have to sit down again and see how things have improved in Python since I first started on the project.\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>Comment from: Terry Hancock [Member] Ã‚Â· http://www.anansispaceworks.com</strong>\r\n\r\n    11/19/05 @ 07:39\r\n    Well, I would have an easier time handling strings in Python than in Perl, so I don't know if I can really answer that.\r\n\r\n    In reality, Python and Perl are very similar in what they can do, so differences are primarily aesthetic. For me, anyway, Python is aesthetically a lot nicer, and I find it a lot easier to remember the syntax and keywords.\r\n\r\n    But it doesn't surprise me to find that other people feel differently. What Python hasn't had is a collection like CPAN. But there is now the Cheese Shop (http://cheeseshop.python.org/pypi), which despite the unfortunate name, does seem to have some cheese in it. And of course, both the language and the standard library have improved over time.\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>Comment from: Linda Walsh [Visitor]</strong>\r\n\r\n    11/23/05 @ 22:39\r\n    In regards to the periphery of posting, you mentioned \"when I'm interested in a task I can focus on it for a ridiculously long time\". FWIW: In the book \"Healing ADD\" by Daniel G. Amen, M. D., he describes 6 subtypes of ADD. Type 3, he terms as \"Overfocused ADD\". I've talked with another psychologist who uses Amen's methods in diagnosis and treatment about type 3. Of all the subtypes of ADHD, in his experience, he thought that Overfocused-ADD is the most difficult to get diagnosed and the most difficult to treat. IMO, the former is due partially to the high functional ability of those in this type, and the latter being that stimulant medications can \"overstimulate\" the \"overfocssed\" part -- exacerbating that to injurious levels."
