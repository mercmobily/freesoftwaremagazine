I'll keep you guys posted on the outcome. I've asked this person to either ask Brian directly or to relay some updated contact information, aswell as passing on this page, the 'Free-Moria' page, and the email of the appeal contact.\r\n\r\nGood luck with the appeal guys :)\r\n\r\n-- Tom"

Either way, I've added Commander Keen to the list of suggested works to target on the Freedom Buyer wiki at http://freedombuyer.wikia.com/wiki/Suggested_Works. The Freedom Buyer project hasn't taken off yet, as there's not been a lot of interest so far. If you're particularly passionate about freeing Commander Keen, maybe you'd like to start a campaign on the wiki to try to do that. There's a lot of classic computer games which I expect quite a lot of people would like to see freed.\r\n\r\n--\r\nGNU - free as in freedom"

    body: "I am grateful to read that this effort paid off. I have spent MANY hours playing various Moria incarnations (anyone ever play MacBoss, on 68k Macs?).\r\n\r\nFWIW, in a certain anthology volume, there was allusion that an unauthorized video game had been created of \"Calvin and Hobbes\", the comic strip (said strip written by Bill Watterson). I believe \"Commander Keen\" gives tribute to the comic strips \"Spaceman Spiff\" in a rather loving way. I doubt the current owners of CK will part with the rights."
