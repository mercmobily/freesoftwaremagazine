    body: "Hi Tony - I think your profile module might work for a site I am trying to construct where a role of user is editting a list of scripts that they create.  I'd like this list of scripts to be accessible in a tab in the profile similar to how you have the personal blogs on the stripper profiles.  Let me know if I can take a closer look at your module.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nMarita\r\n\r\n\r\n"
