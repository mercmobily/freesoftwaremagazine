The huge repositiory of Debian packages, the network installation, the huge number of mirrors, the network of package maintainers and the Debian community have been a continuing source of joy. To speed up the network installations, I have my own local mirror.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI use Linux terminal servers and had to install LTSP manually, and I had some difficulties switching to AMD64, but all those are getting smoothed out this year. LTSP is being packaged for Debian as are 64 bit versions of FreeNX and OpenOffice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe new Debian installer does an adequate job and is very flexible. I have had students use it with no problems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA very good article. Thanks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr/>\r\n\r\n<strong>From</strong>: Paul Sams \r\n<strong>Url</strong>: \r\n<strong>Date</strong>: 2006-01-26\r\n<strong>Subject:</strong> Jump To Debian\r\n\r\n\r\nGood article. I think the 2.4 kernel is 2.4.27. I got aquainted with Debian by using one of it's offspring(Mepis). In my opinion, debian Stable is tops. I have used SuSE, Ubuntu, Fedora, Mepis, & Mandrake. They are all good, but Debian's quality is apparent even to a non technical person as my self. While the initial install is not as easy as Mepis or Ubuntu, it's not nearly as hard as it's often puported to be. What keeps me with Debian stable is it's \"rock solid dependability.\" In my opinion, for what it's worth, more Debian \"on the desktop\" would greatly increase the acceptance of GNU/Linux. Debian Stable is often considered \"out of date\" in the Linux world, but it's far ahead of any Microsoft OS, and far more user friendly. It should be the first choice for anyone entering the world of computing. I used to be a firm believer in WinXP, however, after using an installed Debian System, I no longer need or want Windows. I know that to the masses, Microsoft is Computing, for me it's Debian.\r\n\r\nPaul Sams\r\n\r\n<hr/>\r\n\r\n<strong>From</strong>: fist \r\n<strong>Url</strong>: \r\n<strong>Date</strong>: 2006-01-27\r\n<strong>Subject:</strong> robust package management system?\r\n\r\n\r\nMaybe I just haven't had enough experience yet, but apt-get sucks.  I've had much better luck using freebsd's ports than I've ever had with my newly installed debian distro and apt-get.  Either it never finds the obvious package I'm requesting, or it requires dependencies which apt-get refuses to recursively install.  For almost every package I've needed, I've had to resort to compiling from source (Which still works better than apt-get).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<hr/>\r\n\r\n<strong>From</strong>: Omari \r\n<strong>Url</strong>: http://www.smileystation.com\r\n<strong>Date</strong>: 2006-02-25\r\n<strong>Subject:</strong> Only non-commercial distro?\r\n\r\n\r\n\"It is the only major distribution not developed (or even backed) by commercial vendors, but by a group of volunteers around the world.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\numm...Gentoo?\r\n\r\n<hr/>\r\n\r\n"
