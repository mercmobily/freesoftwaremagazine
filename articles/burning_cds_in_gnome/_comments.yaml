    body: "One of the frustrating things about the gnome burners is that none that I have used convert and burn on the fly.\r\nI am going to try brasero asap, but I doubt that software will do it either.\r\nBy not converting and then burning on the fly like programs like nero in windows do, audio cd creation times seem to double.\r\n\r\nAlso, sound juicer may be OK for the casual audio CD ripper but I find it to be very lackluster in features and performance. It is definitely under par compared to things like CDex and EAC.\r\n\r\nSo far I find that linux and audio cd creation/ripping is lacking compared to windows, but I find it easier to make a data cd in linux due to command line tools and the like.\r\n\r\nWith linux becoming more popular on the desktop, it is only a matter of time before audio cd creation and ripping matches the power of the apps on other platforms."

Ripping your songs to MP3 format is as simple as copying and pasting the virtual MP3 files to another folder or to your MP3 player.\"\r\n\r\nAnd here you can see allso pics: http://docs.kde.org/userguide/audio-cd.html\r\n\r\n\r\nI allso think that lacking of ability to burn video-dvd is big  downside of gnome-burners. I personally nautilus burner + K3b, since K3b is superb for everything I can't do with nautilus burner. So I would like to see gtk version of it. Maybe I just have to consider to moving to KDE after KDE4 is released. "

The others may be lean and mean but without something like image burn verification, I will choose K3b everytime. \r\n\r\nMoreover, image verification is not a heavy feature to add; it can be done in like two lines of shell script so this 'obscure' feature doesn't cost much in terms of code bloat.\r\n\r\nSo unless you have never EVER needed an md5 checksum to confirm what you burned is what you downloaded, I don't see what makes this 'obscure'.\r\n\r\n"

This is a major setback, as I often have this need.  Thwy cannot format DVD-RW discs either.  Don't know why this is the case when Windows has had these features for over a decade."
