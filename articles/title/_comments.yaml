    body: "I saw this statement in your op-ed:\r\n\"Android at this point is the only serious threat the iPhone faces\"\r\nand I have to wonder if you don't look at the numbers.  Does not Blackberry deserve a mention here?  In Q1, the Blackberry Curve was the top-selling smartphone.  Almost as importantly, two other Blackberry's were in the top 5.\r\n\r\nSo while the G1's entry into that top 5 list is notable, I challenge your assertion that it is the \"only serious threat\"\r\n\r\nI appreciate your unflinching support of open source software but isn't it risky to avoid facts while trying to carry that standard?  Don't you risk journalistic integrity?\r\n\r\n\\\\uSlacker"

    body: "Its not that Apple's products \"look\" good - its that they *work* well; they are designed with a focus on the user, rather than the interests of the developers.\r\n\r\nA key challenge for free software development is that it is generally driven by the interest of the developer - this is hardly surprising; but it means that the developer's focus isn't on user needs but on other matters.\r\n\r\nFor free software projects to succeed in the way Apple has, they need to have a strong vision of a set of users, their needs and design and develop for that.\r\n\r\nIf \"looking nice\" is part of usability (and yes, it actually often *is* - something that is pleasurable to use is more *useful* than something that is a struggle to use or irritating to use), then design-led approaches will incorporate \"look\" - but not for its own sake.\r\n\r\nJeremy"
