This is one thing I like better about GNOME. I have to switch to just using the program's name in the menu for KDE because the description in parenthesis is very cluttering. And if you leave the default and install GIMP it will appear as GIMP Image Editor (Image Editor). Very annoying. If every .desktop file listed what should appear in the menu in the Name entry like the GNOME apps do everything would be much nicer.\r\n\r\nChad\r\n<a href=\"http://linuxappfinder.com\">http://linuxappfinder.com</a>"

As much as I dislike Novell for their contract with the devil I can't put down the wonderful work the opensuse community has done - I adore their Gnome setup because it is so pretty and serene - and although I havnt spent much time with their KDE setup, it seems that the K-menu is MUCH easier to use.

What an odd duck, I never would've guessed it off-hand.\r\n\r\nAs far as the first login goes, it always takes a little while longer because KDE sets up its configuration files in your home directory. Every subsequent login is MUCH faster.\r\n\r\nIf you wanted a more organized K Menu, then openSUSE's version would have been a better choice than Kubuntu. Some have complained about the odd navigation, but a few weeks of using it convinced me that it's a much better way to organize a menu. Far less cluttered, without the endless panes of cascading lists that can reach into infinity.\r\n\r\nThe best advice I have is to give the KDE apps a chance instead of running your usual Gnome apps within KDE. The magic of KDE comes from the integration of all the apps and utilities. Opening, editing and saving text files in Kate transparently over ftp is a good example of this. I've never been able to do this properly in Gnome.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I still prefer Evolution to KMail for my IMAP mail. Not all the KDE apps are suitable for my needs."

I rememer that going from Windows 3.1 to Windows 95 freaked me out, and I found it very tiring and distressing for 10 or 11 years after that (actually a week or so pulled it up, but I am still finding stuff in XP). I think a lot of the usability of the GUI comes from learning the visual cues etc. As another example, OS-X really confuses the hell out of me, but only as I haven't taken the time to sit and learn what the obvious, intuitive intereactions are meant to be like.\r\n\r\nAll power to the KDE/Gnome battle. We are seeing both environments move ahead in leaps and bounds, trying things out (and failing in some cases), but in general, moving in the same direction: a full featured usable desktop, with shared standards and a choice. Sharing when they can, and competing/disagreeing when the need arises. Any given battle may be won by the other, but they both win by being able be different.

I loaded KDE (not the Kubuntu DE, mind you - we're talking straight KDE) and found it responsive enough - but cluttered. Sure, I could figure out where stuff was and admit there's a higher level of control options available but, I tend to like one (or two, at most) directions to get to where I need to go. KDE seems to bend over backward trying to make 6 roads to reach the same destination. \r\n\r\nThe stickler for me, on a laptop that roams, is wireless configurations. In Gnome, I have network-manager. It's perfect and never fails me. It does it all, right in that one little icon. In KDE, I see at least 4 places where I can configure my network connections and, in my case, only one of them worked. I installed the KDE equivalent of NM and, although it first launched and fully resembled the Gnome version, it soon sank and would only display a red \"x\" and claim it wasn't running. If I can't easily switch between open/hidden/encrypted/shared/LAN/wireless networks using a laptop then the DE is useless to me, no matter how shiny it is."

    body: "I am an opensuse and ubuntu user who has been using kde and gnome for quite some time on a number of distributions. I always used to be a big kde fan until I gave gnome a try. \r\n\r\nWhen switching from kde to gnome you realise how trashy all the names of the kde programs are. It is like a bunch of teenage slang talkers got together and named them all, trying to put a K into every name and the random capitalization. I have installed quite a few desktop linux machines over the years and have consistent complaints about having trouble with all the strange names. Image is a big thing for standard desktop users and I think that is going to be KDE's downfall."

    body: "The default shortcut for closing a tab within Firefox is either Ctrl+F4 OR Ctrl+W. As Ctrl+W will do the same on both Opera and IE7, it could be argued (in today's most-popular-wins culture) of being a de-facto standard. :o)\r\n\r\nApps and the Window manager are always going to clash on shortcuts. Heck even between Firefox and its own extensions there are conflicts.\r\n\r\nFirefox maps Ctrl+Shift+F to re-open last closed tab (very handy)\r\nWebDeveloper toolbar maps it to Display Element Information (even handier). Firefox overrules WDT on that one though.\r\n"
