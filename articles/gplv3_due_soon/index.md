  After a year and a  half, [GPLv3](http://fsfeurope.org/projects/gplv3/) is  finally due this Friday, June 29th.  Starting with the January 2006 launch,  our focus in FSFE has on raising awareness and informing the free  software community.  Making transcripts  of [the  January 16th launch](http://www.ifso.ie/documents/gplv3-launch-2006-01-16.html)  and [RMS's  first GPLv3 presentations](http://www.ifso.ie/documents/rms-gplv3-2006-02-25.html)...

...and  getting [them  on Slashdot](http://yro.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=06/02/28/1442241) was a good start.

  We will have a situation where GPLv3 has been read by many people  and a lot of the community have been involved in debating the words  used.

  Licensing is a very important consideration for the free software  community.  It requires experts, and it has to be done by people who  have the free software community's interests in mind.  So it's  something we can't let our corporate associates do on our behalf.

  Some lawyers were required, but the type of expert we needed most  were those who care about the long term future of free software and  who would give their time to research and discuss the implications  of various policy decisions.

  Because the free software community had never done anything like  this before, there were almost no people with this type of  experience.  That's why raising maximum awareness was essential.

  For FSFE's part, having secured  funding [from  NLnet](http://www.nlnet.nl/project/gpl3/how.html), we  organised [an  international conference in Barcelona](http://fsfeurope.org/projects/gplv3/europe-gplv3-conference).  And thanks to funding  raised by others, and sometimes personal expense, we were able to  have speakers at 20 or 30 other events.  That,  and [all the  transcripts](http://fsfe.org/transcripts#licences) - with translations  in [Dutch](http://fsfeurope.org/projects/gplv3/brussels-rms-transcript.nl.html), [Thai](http://lewcpe.com/doc/rms-gplv3-2006-02-25-th.html),  [German](http://akfoerster.de/text/tivoisierung.html), [French](http://fsfeurope.org/projects/gplv3/brussels-rms-transcript.fr.html),  [Spanish](http://www.fsfeurope.org/projects/gplv3/fisl-rms-transcript.es.html),  and maybe others.  I was surprised at how popular the transcripts  were.

  And after all that work, I think GPLv3 is in a strong position.  Many [free  software](http://fsfeurope.org/documents/freesoftware) users and distributors have probably not read GPL  version 2.  That is because it is easy enough to use that people can  to use it by following the example of others and doing what seems  intuitive.  GPLv3 will also be this easy, but after 18 months of  debate, as well as having a new licence, I think we  now have a new and valuable level of licence knowledge in the community.
