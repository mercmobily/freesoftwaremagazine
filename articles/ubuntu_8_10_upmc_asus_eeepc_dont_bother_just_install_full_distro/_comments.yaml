Oh well, next time you'll know what to do when your Xandros dies on you!!! :-P"

    body: "This system does seem to work very effectively, though as it is using the USB pen as a Live USB setup, booting is very slow. It would be nice if one could use the USB pen for a proper permanent installation. I gather this is not (yet?) possible. I do have the EeeBuntu Base installed in place of Xandros, and it works well for Internet functions, including, of course, the wireless connection automatically - but it does not include OpenOffice, or any other WP.\r\n\r\nHowever there are other advantages with the Live USB installation. I find it is perfectly able to log in to a local Windows (Samba) Network, including using a printer in OpenOffice.org through Samba.\r\n\r\nIf your Xandros use of the SSD disk is dead anyway, why not clear it and mount it. You then have 2G of permanent memory."
