  "[IPRED2](http://fsfeurope.org/projects/ipred2/)", a  proposed EU directive to criminalise copyright, patent, and  trademark infringement, will be voted on next week in Strasbourg.  The MEPs are talking about it in their meetings this week, so it is  important to contact them as soon as possible to tell them what we  think.

  I will be  sending [an  open letter from FSFE](http://fsfeurope.org/projects/ipred2/letter-april-2007.en.html) to the MEPs tonight, after translations  are completed.

  The proposed text, in all formats and languages, can be found  on [the  proposal's eur-lex page](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/smartapi/cgi/sga_doc?smartapi!celexapi!prod!DocNumber&lg=EN&type_doc=COMfinal&an_doc=2006&nu_doc=0168&model=guicheti).  FSFE endorses amending that text  with [the  compromise amendments hosted on FFII's site](http://action.ffii.org/ipred2/FFII_Analysis).

  The status of the Directive can be followed  on [the  proposal's Legislative Observatory page](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/oeil/file.jsp?id=5263692).

  And more  information can be found on [the Copy  Crime website](http://copycrime.eu/), and  on [FSFE's IPRED2  page](http://fsfeurope.org/projects/ipred2/).  In particular, it is worth signing  the [petition on the Copy  Crime site](http://copycrime.eu/petition).
