    body: "Well, not that exact problem. But certainly this sort of thing happens.\r\n\r\nI routinely can't remember how to spell a word that I can type without thinking about it. In fact, that's the key: I don't have to remember how to spell it, precisely because I can type it without thinking about it. In other words, the knowledge has moved out of my consciousness and to a lower level of processing.\r\n\r\nIn a sense, that means you actually know it better, because you don't have to waste time thinking about it. The degree to which a programming language makes this easy for you is a sign of its \"intuitiveness\" and hence its ability to help you express yourself better.\r\n\r\nBecause, just as with writing, if you have to think about every word (let alone every keystroke), you lose your grip on the big picture.\r\n\r\nMind you, I can usually remember the spelling if I just <em>pretend</em> to type it, and that might well work for you, too.\r\n"

    body: "Terry,\r\n\r\nI am not alone with this!\r\nI have _no_ idea how to spell anything. \r\n\r\nWhen I was 4, I had an accident at home and I cut all of my right hand's tendons and nerves. After much re-hab, my hand healed. Then, when I was 14, my right hand stopped working. I couldn't write for more than 30 seconds without getting unbearable cramps. And, my hand would decide to close into a tight fist, completely out of my control.\r\nI learned how to spell... typing. Give me a piece of paper, and I just have no idea. The only way for me to remember it by imagining a keyboard in front of me, and then follow the movements of my fingers :-D\r\n\r\nI never thought of it as writing going to a different level of my consciousness...!\r\n\r\nMerc."
