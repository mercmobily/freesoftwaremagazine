    body: "As the writer of the actual software the author takes the interesting approach of speaking about many of his choices in approach in the first person.\r\n\r\nAt first this is a bit disconcerting but once you keep reading is a very nice naturalistic approach.\r\n\r\nMany books of this type either delve very deeply into the innards or workings of a technology like this and you walk away going, \"Ok I know how it works but I do not know how to make it work.\"  \r\n\r\nOr they take a how-to approach at the expense of delving into the workings of the technology and you walk away knowing how to make the program or service work but no real understanding of the inner workings behind it.\r\n\r\nThe author in this book as the walks through the theory and reasoning for how things work he also gives real-world examples and setups which is very refreshing as you walk away with both a more than basic understanding of the technology plus an idea that at the end of the day you could set up a number of UML instances that someone could actually really use in the world.  \r\n\r\nAll in all if you have interest in this topic this is a very good book for both how-to and understanding.  I have to disagree with the con listed in the review.  Unless you are looking to hack the UML code itself I think his coverage of \"how it works\" is quite complete especially for say a Systems Administrator."
