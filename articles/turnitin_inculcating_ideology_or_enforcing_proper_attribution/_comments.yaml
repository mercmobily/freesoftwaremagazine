    body: "If someone clearly presents another's work as their own, then that's a falsehood. If they can say that lives depended upon such a falsehood, perhaps we may forgive them, but it remains a falsehood.\r\n\r\nHowever, should plagiarism detection bots be unleashed even on our private PCs? No.\r\n\r\nProtection of life may warrant invasion of privacy in order to determine pertinent truth, but the pursuit of truth for its own sake doesn't justify an invasion of privacy.\r\n\r\nIf you submit a work that you declare as your own in an exam, then what possible rights are infringed by the examiner performing due diligence to check it wasn't plagiarised?"

    body: "Aside from the technical problems with this system (who submits and essay first is not necessarily the same person who wrote it first), there is the other ethical issue. If we teach students that they should not do things because they may be caught, rather than because it is the right thing to do, where will we be when they are released out in to the world? A lack of trust over trivial things like plagiarism in essays or attendance to classes (like the finger print registers of students being implemented in some UK schools) does nothing to teach students the responsibility they need to learn. All they understand is \"don't, you'll get caught\". When they realise they can lie, cheat, steal and even murder in the real world without being caught, what stops them?\r\n\r\nWe need to be educating them, not testing them. The aim of the system is not to ensure that all the students produce individual essays. It is to produce responsible and productive members of society.\r\n\r\nYou can never guarantee to stop people cheating. At some point, we have to trust each other. "

The data that they collect from student work (or \"derive\" as the author linked above puts in red letters, apparently trying to convince us that this constitutes \"derivation\" under copyright law) is just as much \"fair use\" as computing a hash or storing keywords as Google does. It would be a disastrous additional reduction to \"fair use\" if such data collection were to be regarded as legal \"derivation\" for copyright purposes.\r\n\r\nSo, while I hope Turnitin goes away, and I think it's a really bad idea, it would be even worse if the courts were to rule its data collecting activities illegal!\r\n"

    body: "Turnitin is NOT a \"search engine.\"  Search engines benefit both Webmasters and the public, for FREE.  Search engines have an \"opt-out\" feature to prevent Web caching, and they certainly do not copy, distribute, or profit from students' unpublished works without permission.\r\n\r\nWhat is the core of the word, \"derivative\"?  The core is \"derive.\"  What is the definition of \"derive\"? \r\n\r\nDefinition:\r\n\"to take, receive, or obtain, especially from a specified source\"\r\n<a href=\"http://dictionary.reference.com/search?db=*&q=derive\">http://dictionary.reference.com/search?db=*&q=derive</a>\r\n\r\nTurnitin.com derives its product directly from students' intellectual property, without permission.  Copyright law protects against derivation without consent.  Period.  You can't put a spin on that fact, Terry.  The first student(s) to bring a lawsuit against Turnitin will win. \r\n\r\nTurnitin also falsely states that they do not keep a copy of the paper that is readable by human beings.  In fact, they claim that once they copy a student's paper, the material that they maintain is \"no longer the student's paper.\"  (Well, they HAVE to state that, or else they wouldn't have even the slightest justification for STEALING students' property.)  Regardless, that is a complete lie!  If it were true, they would not be able to later email word-for-word copies of students' papers to other professors around the world.  (Yes, that's what Turnitin does, in case you weren't aware.)\r\n\r\nThere is much more to the article than what you've suggested. "

I questioned my professor, this evening about my intellectual property rights, he blew me off. Then I mentioned if I didnt want to have a digital fingerprint, he mentioned FERPA. Then told me to go to contact the adminstration. I told him I will.\r\n \r\nI completely understand the behaviors of students who benefit by cheating. At what cost? Yes, you should not use papermills. Then not use work, without properly citing it in the correct format AMA,APA or MLA. It is a bunch of poppycock, the justification of this manipultive and deceptive tool. \r\n\r\n\r\nWhat recourse does anyone have besides, dealing with manipulating and stealing by this program? Stealing students papers.. Any university that uses this program, you should question their ethics and motives.  Unless, a group of students and parents files suit aganist John Barrie and Turnitin. "
