    body: "Well, it's true to state that the the origins of copyright in the UK (the Statute of Anne of 1710) are based on a utilitarian concept of copyright similar to that of the US (The Statute of Anne is described within its own text as \"An act for the encouragement of learning\"). However, in 1886 the UK ratified the Berne Convention, which was very much influenced by the French concept of the <em>droit d'auteur</em> - I personally would see this as the point at which copyright in the UK started being discueed in terms of natural, rather than statutory rights.\r\n\r\nIn any case, whether the 'natural rights' reasoning for copyright law is a recent phenomenon or not, I'd still consider the IPPR's rejection of it to be a significant step for free culture.\r\n\r\n(Edited for spelling)"

    body: "Moral rights are about accuracy of attribution, and the right to privacy. People may mistake the right to integrity as a right to prevent derivatives, but this is a distortion.\r\n\r\nThe idea that an author is entitled to control what people do with his work arises from the relatively recent concept of intellectual property extending to published works - given that indefinite extension of copyright has begun to establish this assumption, i.e. that copyright grants an author ownership. People are easily led to believe commercial privileges are rights, given enough spin.\r\n\r\nI hope the IPPR has not rejected any concept of moral rights."

    body: "I understand the difference between moral rights and copyright, however the <em>droit d'auteur</em> in the French conception of copyright encompasses both moral rights (<em>droits moraux</em>), and proprietary rights (<em>droits patrimoniaux</em>). The 'proprietary right' refers to the economic aspects of copyright, and which are justified, in the French legal system, as natural rights.\r\n\r\nHere's a copy of the French <a href=\"http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/WAspad/RechercheSimplePartieCode?commun=CPROIN&code=CPROINTL.rcv\"><em>Code de la Propriete Intellectuelle</em></a>, and an <a href=\"http://www.wipo.int/clea/docs_new/en/fr/fr062en.html#JD_AL111_1\">English translation</a> (courtesy of WIPO). Under the heading 'Justification for Copyright', Art. L. 111-1. states that:\r\n\r\n<em>'The author of a work of the mind shall enjoy in that work, by the mere fact of its creation, an exclusive incorporeal property right which shall be enforceable against all persons.'</em>\r\n\r\nThis is at odds with the UK / US conception of copyright that you refer to as it treats copyright as both a property right and as a natural right, a point of view that gained currency in the UK when we became a signatory to the Berne Convention, which is formulated along the lines of the French justification for copyright.\r\n\r\nAnd no, the IPPR has not proposed the rejection of Moral rights!\r\n\r\n"

    body: "Sorry, got confused by droit d'auteur and droits moraux.\r\n\r\nThe droits patrimoniaux, if they apply even after publication (non-contracted distribution), do indeed seem to attempt to establish the author's natural right to their intellectual works. The limitation to death+70 a mere inexplicable detail.\r\n\r\nSo, if the Berne convention embraced droits patrimoniaux (was it death+70 even in 1886?), then this may represent the earliest record of its establishment, but does it represent the point at which published works became equivalent to private property in the popular consciousness?\r\n\r\nIf the IPPR is challenging droits patrimoniaux (at least post-publication) then this is good news.\r\n\r\nI hope the IPPR recommends far greater take up of droit moraux, because the UK has not fully embraced them in all areas."

    body: "I know - the time limit puzzles me, too... If the <em>droit patrimoniaux</em> is a natural right, surely that exists in perpetuity? (assuming, of course, you recognise that right). Perhaps the time limit is a generous concession on the part of authors, in the interest of preserving the public domain...  &lt;/sarcasm&gt; \r\n\r\nIn any case, I believe (AFAIK) that the 1888 copyright term under Berne was life plus 50 - this was extended to life plus 70 comparatively recently.\r\n\r\nI've got a very good essay somewhere comparing the <em>droit patrimoniaux</em> to the US conception of copyright and analysing the justification for both. Can't find it at the moment, but I'll post it up here when I find it!\r\n\r\n"

    body: "I suspect droits d'auteur dilutes the meaning of droits by using 'droit' both as natural right as well as statutory privilege.\r\n\r\nNatural rights I would have thought are those things that the individual is strongly inclined to and often able to protect by their own efforts. Usually applauded by all as worth protecting by any state on behalf of its citizens.\r\n\r\nI can protect my person, the privacy of my domain and my property within it, uphold my honour to truth in all things, and respecting this of others, otherwise enjoy freedom in society. I would wish any state to enshrine this.\r\n\r\nWhat I cannot do is police the entire countryside prosecuting anyone I find reproducing or building upon artworks I have previously sold at a market place. That is of course unless they have demonstrated dishonour through falsehood (passing off, plagiarism, misrepresentation, etc.). What other citizens would believe I had a natural monopoly to exploit the art I created (itself built upon by my experiences of other's art)?\r\n\r\nSuch monopolies are not rights, but privileges, granted and protected by the state.\r\n\r\nThe privilege actually suspends the public's right to freedom of expression.\r\n\r\nSomeone needs to remind the French what is meant by liberté, égalité, fraternité."
