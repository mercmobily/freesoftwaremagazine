    body: "I've heard friends of mine from the Dark Side who are afflicted with this misconception of Linux as if it were one company or organization with a single marketing strategy.\r\n\r\nThe truth is that Linux is an example of \"Community Based Peer Production\" (CBPP), which as I've argued <a href=\"http://www.freesoftwaremagazine.com/articles/free_matter_economy_2?page=0%2C1\">elsewhere</a> may evolve to replace the corporation as the most efficient means of large scale production, at least in information-dominated enterprises.\r\n\r\nContrary to the FUD, however, such CBPP arrangements aren't anti-commercial, they're just anti-corporate. What they should be expected to encourage is large free markets of smaller producers, replacing the \"controlled market\" internal to corporations.\r\n"

    body: "I believe some of this FUD is a result of Linux affecting proprietary operating system provider profits.  In a dawg eat dawg society, sympathisers and downright corporate assigned trolls post information with misinformation to dissuade the unaware to affect their opinion.  To them, there is much at stake affecting corporate profits.\r\n\r\nMr. William Gates, Microsoft has been purchasing newspaper companies through his philanthropic interests.  If media is owned, it is easier to inhibit writers from expressing favourable articles toward Linux and open source software.\r\n\r\nOne only needs to read troll posts on comp.os.linux.advocacy, to understand what I am expressing here.\r\n\r\nLinux Advocate"

The author makes vague, sweeping statements and yet doesn't give us the benefit of any supporting evidence.\r\n\r\nIf you actually read the output of some analysts you might be surprised at how well the understand the free software world. Try looking at the 451 Group's website and their daily links to open source related articles.\r\n\r\nIt's a shame that Free Software Magazine gives a platform to material such as this, which reflects poorly on the community as a whole."
