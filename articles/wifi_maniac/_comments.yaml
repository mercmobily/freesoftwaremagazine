By doing so you remove the demand on manufacturers to open up their source code so that we can completely functioning hardware running the way we want it to run.\r\n"

    body: "Sir, you're seriously confused.  This is not the \"it runs so shut up\" camp.\r\n\r\nCalling ndiswrapper a solution to get WiFi up and running is a joke at best.  Where does that leave AMD64 and PowerPC users?  Where does that leave the ability to debug and fix problems in a timely fashion?  Just like it happened with video cards where we accepted that the ATI and NVIDIA binary drivers are ok for a whole lot of wrong reasons, it's going to happen again with WiFi drivers.  Where are we now with the video drivers for high end cards?  We have binary blobs for a limited number of architectures which we can't study, modify, improve or port to other architectures.  Would the linksys hacks be possible if we had accepted ndiswrapper as a solution?  When was the last time you actually saw a vendor providing driver downloads for Windows on MIPS?"

Hint: They stop as soon as your card is out of production and MS changes the driver model again.\r\n\r\nGet a Ralink based device (aprox. EUR 22.00) and just plug and play, NATIVELY. Why should you buy supported hardware to run a free OS? Simple. You should spend money to be able to use a computer in freedom. If freeloading is your only desire, you are not a part of the community."

Yes the ndiswrapper is an intermediate step that must be taken to in order for Linux users to use much WIFI hardware.  Its sad and unfortunate that genuine Linux drivers are not available from the manufacturer (and equally troubling that programming documentation is not available from many of them without developers signing non-disclosure agreememts).  Also, the NDA''s may come with a fee, or limited use licence (which ruins all hope for a general Linux driver).  In the intermediate time between now and when Linux achieves world domination, the ndiswrapper is here.  Happy wifi''ing.'

Not everyone who makes 802.11abg cards includes binary firmware in \"free\" drivers or ignores GNU/Linux.\r\n\r\nDon't be part of the problem. Be part of the solution. Encouraging manufacturers to rely on ndiswrapper usage sucks for people like me, who are forced through BIOS restrictions to use Broadcom wireless cards which crash ndiswrapper + amd64 (total and complete lockup) on a regular basis.\r\n\r\nI use the Hawking instead, and hey, guess what? The ralink driver works great. The only problem is you can't use it as a base station, but that's coming.\r\n\r\n"

    body: "Why should someone have to go spend additional money on another wifi card when they have one that is prefectly fine to begin with.  Part of the problem with Windows applications and hardware is cost and security.  Why is everyone so defensive when a person wants to work with what they have already, instead of having to stock pile additional hardware because it doesn't work after installation.  I have a broadcom 4303 internal wifi card that would not work after installation.  I found two solutions and chose the one that didn't require the ndiswrapper to be installed, however I lost in the end by choosing not to install the ndiswrapper since this option limits my top speed to 11M.  I will not listen someone who tells me I have to spend more money on hardware when there are fixes available and are accepted by Ubuntu.\r\n\r\nI fully agree that the makers of these devices should include Linux in there driver configurations.  Part of the problem is not that hardware manufacture is not supporting linux, they choose to not support linux on legacy hardware.  This is a common practice to minimize costs.  Alot of users I work with are using old hardware and therefore more likely to find no driver support.  Broadcom has drivers that support Linux for there current hardware, it just so happens they don't support my current Wifi card, but I'm not going to spend and extra $20 for a piece of hardware if I don't have to."
