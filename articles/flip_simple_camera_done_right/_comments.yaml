    body: "A year or so ago but then I needed to upgrade my phone and got an HTC Hero which has pretty decent video capabilities and also mounts as a mass storage.\r\n\r\nI feel your pain on the compatibility of well-meaning gifts. My family has a habit of checking with me about suitability before purchasing such gifts for my kids. Mostly this is to check the child doesn't have one already but I use the opportunity to do the \"unconscious steering\" you mention as well.\r\n\r\nI am relived to say that I'm finding a lot of USB-based devices now seem to mount as mass-storage. In fact it seems that most things that don't involve using the device while it is attached to the PC (e.g. uploading data only) will be mass storage these days.\r\n\r\nThe only problem I have then is explaining to my children why the software shown on the box won't work on our PC. In most cases they prefer it that they can use the same software (digikam in the case of a camera)  for their new device as they did for their old one.\r\n\r\nnice piece though.\r\n--\r\nEquitas IT Solutions - fairness, quality, freedom\r\nhttp://www.equitasit.co.uk"
