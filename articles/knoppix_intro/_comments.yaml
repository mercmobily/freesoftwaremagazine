    body: "We wanted to teach a class on basic Linux use with computers at our local CompUSA, but we weren't allowed to replace the operating systems on the computers in their computer lab. So we just printed up a collection of Knoppix CDs, and booted all the computers with that. It worked beautifully.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the class didn't attract many students, so it was a short-lived experiment. But the technology worked great.\r\n"

    body: "I have successfully usede the Knoppix-derivatiev Sidux (http://www.sidux.com) for setting up new Laptops and Desktops. The nice thing about sidux is you get a \"bleeding-edge\" but Debian-unstable based Linux-System. After installing to hard-disk, you can use standard debian utilities for upgrading and installing of additional packages. The standard CD-image contiains KDE + OpenOffice+everything needed for multimedia/Web-Browsing!!!\r\n\r\n<strong>Very Warm recommendation</strong>\r\n"
