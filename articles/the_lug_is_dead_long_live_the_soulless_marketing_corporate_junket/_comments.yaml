    body: "this is the second waste of time i've read this morning.  what purpose do you serve by falsely declaring LUGs as dead when what they need is positive coverage to encourage users to attend?\r\n\r\ni'll tell you what has really happened.  at some point in the past few years the media has begun hyping the need for linux to become more like windows while at the same time making it sound like it's time for the average end-use to abandon MS and install linux.\r\n\r\nwindows users are the most arrogant, ignorant, demanding, impatient and lazy jerks on this planet and as you've seen, linux geeks want nothing to do with them.\r\n\r\nso, you gave yourself a clue in the first paragraph of your article, at the meeting you attended, you met 3 geeks.  okay, find where the other geeks are and you will have the address of your next LUG meeting.\r\n\r\ni've been using linux for just over a year now and for the past 8 months i've been actively helping other newbies in forums and irc.  not so much anymore, i can't stand the new version of newbie who act like they just paid me $400 for a new OS and $120 an hour to install and configure it while also teaching them how to use it, instead of $0 for the OS and volunteers offering help.\r\n\r\nfor some reason the same media has also made it bad form to use the term RTFM.  But guess what, that's exactly what they need to do and also learn to use google and be patient and courteous to the help."

For a start they may not even know where the FM is! IME experience those users that are ignorant and lazy are generally those who a) believe the sales hype from Microsoft and others and b) have bought into the (mistaken) ideal that a computer is a consumer electrical device like a TV or Radio.\r\n\r\nWhat they need to learn (and probably don't know it) is that - with freedom - PCs can be a lot more fun that changing the red-eye on your holiday snaps. What they need is patience (on both sides), what they need is someone with time (and the desire to spend it on them), what they need is mentor, what they need is what used to be provided at LUG meetings. In that respect Steve is right to lament the LUG - particularly in it's \"replacement\" by the corporate junket.\r\n\r\nYes newbies can be annoying and frustrating and all those other things but - like learner drivers - most of us start life as one and we would do well to remember it. We need to teach them how not to be annoying and frustrating (just like we are? :o) ) and that takes time and patience. Some of them won't want to change - that's fine let them pay Microsoft then but the others are some of the \"strangers waiting to become friends\".\r\n\r\nLUG meetings *have* changed but it was kind of inevitable that they would as the nature of the LUG changed. A lot of LUG activity now takes place in mailing lists and IRC. In the end though if LUGs have changed it's because the members have grown and changed. That is not unique to Linus User Groups and it is likely to be the case for a while.\r\n\r\nRyan\r\n--\r\nPeople are like savings accounts. if you want any interest you have invest something.\r\n\r\n"

However, we are struggling to get speakers for the meetings.  We had a little bit of discussion about other events, but that withered on the vine.\r\n\r\nMy impression of LUGs (at least the 4 I have attended over the past decade) is that they are mostly (geek) boy's (and a lamentable few girl's) night out.  We get to talk tech with people who understand what we're talking about.  But then we go home to our real lives.  And if it weren't for a handful of volunteers running the website and scheduling meetings, even that much wouldn't happen.\r\n\r\nExcept for a few LUGs with really enthusiatic members, I believe that is all it ever was.  The installfests were fun, but a lot more work than most could manage more than 2 or 3 times.\r\n\r\nIf you are really looking for geek cameradery with with a purpose, I suggest you start a FOSS business.  At least then you get to set the topic of conversations.\r\n\r\nLater . . .   Jim\r\n"

Truth is, the human race will have to go on many more decades before the Luddites die off and assertive computing is no longer synonymous with witchcraft. In the mean time, a new Linux user ends up with the experience just like the parent comment: having buckled down and done the work and earned their reward, they are now confronted with the expectation that they have to humor every loud-mouth troll accusing them of being elitist.\r\n\r\nPolitical democracy is earned, not bestowed from On High, through hard work - it is maintained with vigilance and continuous strife. You don't just sit back and ride; you have to participate in your own and the public's continued well-being. Technology freedom will prove to be no different. And yes, really, people SHOULD read the manual - it's how the rest of us got where we are.\r\n\r\nWhat a radical proposition! Work==reward! I await the arrival of the lynch mob.\r\n"

    body: "The main reason I participate less in LUGs is because I work now and have a family. I don't have nearly as much free time as I did when I was younger. I still try to drop into different LUG mailing lists and online forums now and then and throw out some useful information but I don't have a lot of time to invest in doing this anymore. Also, I've found that my experience has gone beyond what most newbies can appreciate so that if I get involved in conversation with other ubergeeks it's just over the heads of newbies and even most normal geeks. I throw down useful tidbits of knowledge now and then when I see people stuck on some issue but usually the geeks help each other and newbies and I'm no longer needed. With this exclusion from the normal people combined with a lot of unrelated chatter about politics, religion, etc there just isn't a lot of reason to interact with those people. Finally, I've moved around a lot over the years and that has made it difficult to get really comfortable in local LUGs.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I now influence decisions in the work place so we've switched a lot of our systems to opensource and Linux. I get to give co-workers useful knowledge that once I would have spent time giving to LUG members.\r\n\r\nRather than sitting around chatting about how to install a program I'd rather get together and go bowling, play paint ball, or even sit down and build robots and fight them against each other. If any fellow ubergeeks, geeks, or even newbies want to get together for something less dorky than sitting in an empty classroom discussion yum versus apt then maybe I'd be interested."

To often I think that intelligent, less-than-cool, people have trouble meeting likeminded people so there is definately room for geeky social events.\r\n\r\nMaybe some LUG groups should put up fliers at womens gyms and places like that?"

That group of guys wasn't so much for girls as it was for the guys.  In the beginning yes, there were many active call for \"women to participate\" they calls occured to other men, never directly to women... Mind you, women did attend but always in noticable minorities.\r\n\r\nMy take after the experience is that women don't do LUGs so much because (a) the stylish guys are weird - i.e. gay (b) the straight guys are weirder - i.e. straight, geek'd, stragly, pale and marked by skin desease (c) not to mention all the woman biting that occurs if she happens to be pretty and linux aware...\r\n\r\nBe careful what you wish for... you might get it...\r\n"

For example, in the Trentino Alto-Adige(an italian county) the local LUG converted the school system software from MyKroStuff to GNU/Linux and administrative-educative freesoftware. The low chamber of the national parliament adopted in these days a rule to permit parlamentarian administration to migrate to GNU/Linux thanks to the lobbing of the freesoftware supporters. There other examples like these, but the point is that LUG is not dead, not here at least...\r\n\r\nSo long and sorry for my euroenglish."

    body: "I don't know why.  But whenever I raised this issue in our local LUG [www.ilug-cochin.org]  there were oppositions.  I used to point out the lack of spirit the newcomers display.  Some people just don't want to agree the play times are over.  Linux is mature now.  Its the new thingy in the corporate world!\r\n\r\nOf late, a friend of mine migrated to Ubuntu Fiesty (the <b>easiest</b> you can get these days) after years of my persuasion.  He also joined for a Linux certification programme to gain familiarity with the system.  He ringed me for a solution to a display problem.  When I told him to edit xorg.conf, he was quizzing me of his options of switching the distros &mdash; one which don't exhibit any \"troubles\".  He says its too much of a head-ache to actually \"edit\" conf files.  The reason he switched was to compensate  the problems his XP box showed.\r\n\r\nWhat good these people do if they attend any LUG?  I used to see many of these new-era newbies.  \"Can't take Linux -- won't work well with my SoundBlaster!\".  Even if there are solutions, they don't want to <b>touch</b> the command-line.  For them, its worse than leprosy!!  What you've to <i>compile</i> this so-called tarball?  Aargh!!\r\n\r\nAll I do now is sit at home and think about the nostalgic past; when at the next LUG meeting someone would teach you how to add a new kernel module, or get to try out distcc to compile the kernel source, or ... whatever!\r\n\r\nTherefore, its not the LUG that is dead, just the old timers are!  They have migrated to more lucrative (shall I say greener pastures) opportunities.  The new-era newbie don't want to \"learn\".  They have to outwit some other lamer in a forum and show off.  Or get their name in every other wiki on this planet.\r\n\r\nOr get \"Linux\" in their resume and hope for a big fish to hire them.  For them, Linux is just a cash cow.  Boost their geek factor, earn them good job.  There's no time to tweak the kernel, tune the fs, or anything that you do to \"learn\".  Actually.\r\n\r\nOf course, I wouldn't imply all the old-timer geeks have died and gone to Mars or anything.  They are just gone missing...\r\n\r\n...
