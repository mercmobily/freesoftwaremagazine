    body: "Great post--thanks, Terry.  I think free culture can and will work also, but it is difficult to see how the transition will happen.  There is lots of great free stuff out there now by people of varying talent levels, but how to adequately reward it, especially for the very best whose work we really want to enjoy?\r\n\r\nI'm not as worried about incentive as some of the IP maximalists seem to be, but it is a factor.  Talented, creative people will create in any environment, I think, but if someone can make their living from their art, they will produce more.  \r\n\r\nThere needs to be a way to convert (earned!) reputation to reward for new works, so that if someone gained a large following and widespread recognition for their art, they could make their money up front.  There are sites like <a href=\"http://www.fundable.org/\">http://www.fundable.org</a> that can act as mediators for collecting the money and paying the artist if the work is produced.  (This would be available to everyone, not just the well-known, of course, but it seems less likely that you'd be able to raise a large sum up front as a newbie.)\r\n\r\nThere's the old question of micropayments, which I think will be a challenge to use effectively.  There are a lot of good arguments about why they are ineffective and impractical, but wouldn't it be nice if you had a web site with 50,000 visitors per day and you could collect a penny from each of them?  (Ah, daydreams...)\r\n\r\nWith micropayments there is the problem of people (myself included) preferring a flat rate.  What if we had some kind of pooling mechanism.  Let's say there are about 30 web sites that I read regularly and think they are substantial enough to support financially.  I allocate $100 per year towards the sites as a group, and then we have a way to divide the money among the web sites based on the amount of time (or some other factor) that I spend at each.  So if most of my time and attention is directed to 3 sites, they get a larger percentage of the money.  If another site gains more of my interest, they get a larger cut, and so on.\r\n\r\nObviously there'd be the issue of gaming the system or outright fraud with these kinds of systems, but it could be worked on.  I also see a lot of privacy issues with the possible accounting methods, but there are always privacy concerns and we can work on ways of making it work satisfactorily.\r\n\r\nHow would subscription methods work?  If I'm in a pool of web sites with a common payment method, is our work only available to subscribers?  That doesn't seem very free.  Available to subscribers only for a period of time, say a week or month, and then to everyone?  Again I'm not thrilled by that.  I don't know if we can rely on enough people to voluntarily pay for free culture up front, but I really don't want to rely on any system that gives control to producers after the work has been published.\r\n\r\n(P.S. I felt conspicuous when you highlighted pragmatic arguments and those who oppose them.  Not that you were talking about me, but I have written about the importance of ideology over pragmatism, so I felt at least the edge of the spotlight.  However, I agree that practical considerations are important.  As you pointed out, free software has been shown to work, but free culture mechanisms haven't been proven yet, and it is up to us to do so.  And from <a href=\"http://www.freesoftwaremagazine.com/blogs/free_tanks_for_everyone\">my post</a> last week, I think we <em>must</em> do so.)\r\n\r\n----\r\n<a href=\"http://www.movingtofreedom.org/\" title=\"Freedom is on the March!\">http://www.movingtofreedom.org/</a>"

    body: "\"How would subscription methods work? If I'm in a pool of web sites with a common payment method, is our work only available to subscribers? That doesn't seem very free. Available to subscribers only for a period of time, say a week or month, and then to everyone? Again I'm not thrilled by that. I don't know if we can rely on enough people to voluntarily pay for free culture up front, but I really don't want to rely on any system that gives control to producers after the work has been published.\"\r\n\r\nNote that with a \"sunset\" license, the producer is not \"in control\" of the licensing terms after publication: the work becomes free at a specified date and they can't change their mind (because they've already agreed to the license -- it's just post-dated). It would simply \"flow\" from the proprietary to the free commons on a pre-defined time table.\r\n\r\nThe problem with \"up front\" payment methods is that they don't provide any kind of assurance of quality or reward for excellence. If a work is better than expected, the artist receives no extra benefit for that; if it is poorer, then the patron has overpaid. Thus there is no market force to select and promote artistic excellence.\r\n\r\nThe only real exception to that is in the case of series works (and producer loyalty which is much the same thing). Quality works get greater reputation, and artists (or series) which are consistently good might see a gradual increase in funding.\r\n\r\nHowever, a competitive free market is probably better.\r\n\r\nI don't feel that a sunset licensing scheme is better than a free license from the patrons' point of view: clearly you're better off with something like <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.5\">By-SA</a>, but that's getting back to amateur production.\r\n\r\nCurrently, there is one very popular license which attempts to protect professional production while being somewhat \"free\", and that is the Creative Commons' <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.5\">By-NC</a> or <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.5\">By-NC-SA</a>. The business model of companies like <a href=\"http://magnatune.com\">Magnatune</a> is based on this license.\r\n\r\nHowever, the By-NC is a very non-free license in the sense that most  free software advocates mean. It chokes off amateur production, because it kills the primary means of sustaining it (almost everybody is at some level a \"commercial\" user. Having Google ads on your page is enough to disqualify you from distributing NC works!).\r\n\r\nBecause of this, the sharealike (SA) module in By-NC-SA is basically a joke. There's really no point. If you're going to use NC, you might as well use the \"ND\" (non-derivative) license, because you won't get significant collaboration. NC works simply do not \"feed the commons\".\r\n\r\nSo I see the need for a halfway license that works in a different way, so that it <em>does</em> feed the commons. And the only way to do that that I can see is to work on the \"limited times\" rather than the \"fair use\" aspect of the copyright license. So, instead of limiting use to non-commercial users, give yourself a little time to make money off of people who want to see your work early, then release it under a real free license. That way, the work follows a guaranteed path into the commons, which makes it attractive to people who are interested in commons-based values (i.e. they might want to derive something from it).\r\n\r\nIn fact, of course, the two would work nicely together: the NC license that Magnatune uses is fine for simply downloading and listening to music. It's only when I'm looking for tracks to included in a free software package that I get seriously disappointed (<em>How much</em> for a <a href=\"http://magnatune.com/info/license\">commercial license</a>?!).\r\n\r\nSo I see a system of licenses that release a work immediately under a By-NC-ND license, with an extra By-SA license (or By) that applies after a specified period from publication: I was thinking of standard intervals of 1 month, 3 months (1 quarter), 1 year, 3 years , and 7 years. Since the actual license grant is made immediately upon publication, the producer is not in control (they can't revoke the license any more than they can with the immediate license), but the terms don't actually apply until a specified date.\r\n\r\nNote that you don't actually need to write new licenses to implement this. What you use is a \"license grant statements\" or a \"superlicense\" that refers to the two licenses. Of course, for convenience, one could make these superlicenses available as boilerplate.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, works licensed this way would be much \"freer\" than works licensed under a \"non-commercial\" regime, and would serve many of the same purposes.\r\n\r\nNote also that, since the primary value of the commons is to derive new works from old, it's mostly \"old\" works that the licensing matters for: you may want to listen to \"today's tunes\", but it's really the \"goldie oldies\" that you're going to want to remix.\r\n\r\nOur copyright regime is <em>supposed</em> to do this already, but it's broken, because 80+ years is just way too old to be relevant, even for remixing (there are exceptions, of course, but not many). These long delays, plus the fact that the delay keeps getting longer has led to an incredible stagnation of the public domain, which starves new derivatives.\r\n\r\nI was reflecting on this recently when I was reading Heinlein's juvenile SF works from the 1950s: particularly <em>The Rolling Stones</em>. This work is well written, and a lot of fun to read, but it's getting extremely dated. I could imagine a project to produce an annotated version with updated  science and technology notes. It'd be particularly interesting to note where Heinlein was accurate (even prophetic) in his predictions and also where he failed utterly (in brief, he was pretty sharp on the evolution of rocket technology, but woefully inaccurate in materials science and computer science).\r\n\r\nWhen these books were written, Heinlein's motivation was a copyright that would last for 28 years plus an optional 28 year extension. Even if he extended it, therefore, it would have expired in 2006, so  I would be able to do that project. However, in 1978 the copyright was changed <em>retroactively</em> to \"life + 50\", which put the expiration in 2038. Now, after two or more extensions, I believe the expiration is in about 2068. By then, my project would become sort of pointless (not least because I'll most likely be dead).\r\n\r\nLooking at this sort of problem, it seems to me that licenses that effectively reduce the term of restrictive copyright licensing would have a definite niche.\r\n\r\nThis idea, of course, is similar to Creative Commons' Founder's Copyright, but the Founder's Copyright is badly implemented. A delayed free license is a much simpler solution.\r\n\r\nMind you, there are other ways to encourage subscription. If you funded such a program with tax money, as some have suggested, then you are effectively forcing everyone to subscribe (I'm not too happy with that idea myself), or you can simply distribute free-licensed works, but only to subscribers, relying on the delay caused by natural network delays to protect your subscription base (i.e. it's just more convenient to subscribe than to try to hunt the web picking up freebies).\r\n\r\nSo, there are models without the sunset license approach, too.\r\n\r\nAnd, no Scott, you're not the main person I was thinking of when talking about \"dissing pragmatic arguments\". There are plenty of other people who do that. I understand where they're coming from, but I think you have to realize that pragmatics matter, even from an ethical perspective: what's right and what's wrong are highly dependent on predictable outcomes.\r\n\r\nFrom a first-principles \"ethical\" approach I might argue that I should be able to drive my car anywhere I want (any restriction violates my freedom!), but in reality the picture is very different if \"anywhere I want\" happens to be <em>through your car</em> (or house, or lawn...). Likewise, throwing waste products into the environment might seem \"unethical\", but it really depends on what they are and what harm they might do. Predicting outcomes requires \"pragmatic\" analysis.\r\n\r\nThis is made more difficult by the fact that people who value \"economic success of the society\" don't always realize that that's what their worldview implies. So they often have difficulty communicating in \"ethical\" terms. Likewise, \"ethicalists\" actually make many pragmatic assumptions (e.g. that you need source code to be able to modify software) which they are often unconscious of making.\r\n\r\nI view these conflicts primarily as semantic: every \"pragmatic\" argument can be expressed in terms of \"ethics\" and vice-versa. People who prefer pragmatism can always demonstrate that our \"ethics\" arise from a need to meet certain pragmatic necessities of society (and hence individual dependent on that society), while all \"pragmatic\" arguments can be reduced to meeting necessary outcomes to attain \"ethical\" imperatives. This is why I reject the whole issue as a false dichotomy.\r\n"

My dad was (and is) a big SF reader and always had books laying around.  One day when I was about 12 (the golden age of science fiction!), I picked up <em>Red Planet</em> and realized I could follow it enough to enjoy it.  I wondered what a \"slide rule\" was supposed to be, and quickly determined from context that it must be some futuristic gizmo.  This would have been 1982. :-)\r\n\r\n----\r\n<a href=\"http://www.movingtofreedom.org/\" title=\"Freedom is on the March!\">http://www.movingtofreedom.org/</a>"

    body: "1982 is about when I first learned to use a real slide rule!\r\n\r\nWe were required to learn it in high school. The slide rule is actually a really cool device, I don't regret learning it at all. It makes it extremely clear why logarithms needed to be invented.\r\n\r\n<em>Red Planet</em> was actually the first novel I ever read. I think I was about 8 at the time. I still have my original paperback copy, though it's awfully worn by now.\r\n\r\nStill, it is pretty funny reading about people figuring trajectories with slide rules and pencils when a computer capable of solving the entire navigation problem can fit in your hand and run on less energy than the light it takes for you to read the output.\r\n\r\nMore subtlely, I was intrigued by the idea of \"trim weights\" i n <em>Rolling Stones</em> to get a spacecraft to exactly match the mass used in the trajectory calculations. Today, we would regard this as wasteful: it'd be more efficient to recalculate based on the exact weight (Heinlein was assuming that this would require the job to be sent off to a central batch-processing computer on the ground, instead of something you could trivially recompute with an onboard computer).\r\n\r\nMakes you wonder what <em>we</em> are discounting, doesn't it?\r\n"
