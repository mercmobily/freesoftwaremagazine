    body: "<strong>From</strong>: David \r\n<strong>Url</strong>: \r\n<strong>Date</strong>: 2005-07-26\r\n<strong>Subject:</strong> Turged Academic Theory\r\n\r\n\r\nThis whole article reads as a pretentious 2nd or 3rd year University Assignment. Waaaaay to much time arguing cultural semantics and not enough on anything mildly constructive. You may as well have just titled the article \"Theory VS Pragmatism\" and be done with it. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso, beginning an article with some thinly veiled praise to spend the remainder on the evils of LL is rather poor. The tone of your article also markedly changes once you finish your intro and basically comes across as a bit of a hachet job.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLecturer's Comments.\r\n\r\nInteresting attempt but you need to explore more fully what the trade-off's are between what is a pragmatic approach verses a more theoretical analysis. Note: Quoting someone as if what they said were fact and not attributing it gets you marked down. "

Don't you conceal something? You talk a language which is suspect. You don't talk like the rest of us, like the man in the street, but rather like a foreigner who does not belong here. We have to cut you down to size, expose your tricks, purge you. We shall teach you to say what you have in mind, to \"come clear\", to \"put your cards on the table\".... Communication ought not to be over the head of the people; contents that go beyond common and scientific sense should not disturb the academic and ordinary universe of discourse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMarcus on Analytic Critics (pp193, One-Dimensional Man)\r\n\r\n"

From my view Lessig has made the right steps to beat the system with its own weapons. And more important ... lobbying a new culture - something people can understand and join. Right now applications (like Inkscape) are constructed who make it possible to publish files under a free license. Lessig always said that they know that their solution is not the best. They have lost some legal fights because the legal environment and the system is like it is. CC gives, just like the GPL us something we can use instead of just sitting and thinking that we ca not change this. This issue is about beginning to think that other cooperations are possible. This is very hard work - even with people that claim themselves to be progressive."

    body: "<strong>From</strong>: Knud Boehle \r\n<strong>Url</strong>: \r\n<strong>Date</strong>: 2005-08-04\r\n<strong>Subject:</strong> More than a simulacrum of a polemic vs. CC? \r\n\r\n\r\nDear authorrs, dear readers,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe article tells us that CC fits into capitalism (\"If anything, property is the corruption and the crime; an act of theft from the common substrate of creativity\"), and that fighting for \"libre culture\" und \"true democracy\" would require something else. References to Heidegger, Deleuze, and Latour serve to inflate the subject.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe actual benefits of CC are ignored, in particular the role of CC to empower creators (cf. e.g. the article of Mia Garlick clearing the air of what CC is and does today; http://www.indicare.org/tiki-read_article.php?articleId=124). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the question what \"commons\" can mean today is worthwhile and should be separated from the attack against CC (\"provides only a simulacrum of a commons\"). The authors' model is GNU GPL (\"based on a network of ethical practices\") referring to something shared in common.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile the Free and Open Source Software movement may be interpreted this way, the authors fall short to at least outline how this model may look like when applied to media production and publications (the fields CC addresses).  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nKnud\r\n\r\n"
