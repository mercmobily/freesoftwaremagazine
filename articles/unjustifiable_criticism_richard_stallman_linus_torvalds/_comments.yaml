    body: "This commentary is amusingly exactly what Linus would probably have predicted. The piece wasn't about Stallman, he was just mentioned as an example of a political style that Linus rejects, but it was completely predictable that a story in FSM would focus on the minor mention of Stallman, rather than the message of the piece, which is about the spirit of collaboration and openness that he sees in Obama and hopes leads to a healthier image and reality in American politics.\r\n\r\nThis is contrasted to Stallman's exclusionary views - if you don't value software freedom above all else, you're the enemy. I think there is continuing danger that Stallman will have the same negative effect on potential uptake of the issues he supports that Nader has. They both have a level of monomania that makes you root for the white whale...\r\n\r\n"

    body: "Okay, _I'm_ going to take stand: Torvalds was 100% on target in the referenced article.\r\n\r\nTorvalds criticism is (as it has always been) mild and qualified. The message is essentially that Stallman has done some great and good things, but he's imperfect, and following his every footstep is not a good idea. That Torvalds  favors GPLv2 and dislikes GPLv3 is not news, and the truth is that GPLv3 remains fairly controversial among developers.\r\n\r\nSo, what part of this is \"unjustified\" criticism?\r\n\r\nThere's no question that Stallman spends a lot of effort on negative campaigning against proprietary software, and less on promoting the benefits of software freedom. Indeed, when a group of people including Raymond and Perens _did_ form the \"open source\" marketing campaign to promote free software to a much broader community (thereby securing the successful distribution of free software that is responsible for most of Stallman's present day prominence), he _attacked_ them for it on trivial issues like the semantics of the name!\r\n\r\nThe same treatment has been given to Torvalds, who Stallman should owe an enormous debt to for the existence of Linux, without which, Stallman and his GNU project would probably still be anonymously puttering away on an incomplete operating system.\r\n\r\nSo, personally, I think Torvalds is being pretty fair here. Not that there isn't another side to it, but it's all valid criticism, and labeling it \"unfair\" is going pretty far.\r\n"

Please consider this: Linus Torvalds is willing to embrace DRM and Richard Stallman is not. Linus Torvalds doesn't like direct confrontation against Microsoft and Richard Stallman never tires of direct confrontation. \r\n\r\nSo who will say these things which Richard Stallman says if he were to retire and mind his own business? I'd be willing to give it my best shot, but it wouldn't be the same. I know that I'd suffer all the same character attacks from the usual suspects.\r\n\r\nRMS is the GNU-Father. Long may he reign."

    body: "As others have said the article wasn't about Stallman, Torvalds highlighted Stallman's methods and stance as an example of what he didn't like: of what he sees Obama as the opposite of and what he likes about him.\r\n\r\nI don't see this as either \"unjustifiable\" or an \"attack\" on Stallman himself. It's saying \"I don't like this kind of behaviour or attitude and *that's* why I like Obama.\" and when you are describing something it's often helpful to give examples. It's true that he does concentrate on one example and proponent of something he doesn't like (RMS) but it is one that does the job very well and thus more would be distracting.\r\n\r\nYou also said:\r\n\r\n> Through four paragraphs, Linus Torvalds criticizes Richard Stallman, he criticizes GPLv3 in the next paragraph, then Torvalds finishes by endorsing Barack Obama.\r\n\r\nAre you implying there's an imbalance here? He describes behaviours and attitudes he dislikes in the first *five* paragraphs and then speaks of Obama not having those in the next *seven* paragraphs. Sorry, but that sounds like a typical way to introduce your subject in the first half and then move onto your point in the second.\r\n\r\ncheers  \r\nRyan"

    body: "I think what Linus does not like about RMS is his radical attitude.\r\n\r\nLinus has a right to dislike radical behavior. I disagree with RMS too, but at the same time I support him strongly, because I think free software must be promoted radically. This is a very controversial issue.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, RMS cannot derive an ownership of all software written with the GNU tools. RMS likes Linux to be named GNU/Linux, which is bull. As if the kernel was based on any GNU code (written by the FSF). What you consider the \"system\" is only a point of view, never more. I tend to consider the kernel the system. But if RMS says the kernel without the system is nothing, he has his point, too.\r\n\r\nSometimes, things have to be done radically. George W. Bush defended America in a radical way, and I have a limited sympathy for all those critisizing him for that. The same goes for radically promoting free software. Yes, I compare RMS with GWB (must be an insult for both of them)!\r\n\r\nSo the whole issue is a bit of kindergarten talk. Both sides reveal some immaturity when they go too much into attack mode."
