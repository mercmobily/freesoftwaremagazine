    body: "One can upload and download files from Google Docs by the click of a button. Moreover you can download them files in any format you want. With the way humans are connected these days, I doubt if there is any requirement for such \"OFFLINE\" use at all. The only kind of people who might require such \"OFFLINE\" content must be those like budget independent researchers who work in remote areas!!! They can use software like Libre office and upload them later when they reach places with connectivity. SO WHAT'S THE BIG FUSS ABOUT???? GOOGLE DOCS IS GREAT.   \r\n"
