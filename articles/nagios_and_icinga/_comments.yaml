    body: "First of all - thanks for your hard work, keeping up with this story as well as showing both sides.\r\n\r\nSecond of all - what I am writing here is my sole personal opinion. It does not reflect $work or $team Icinga's opinion on the happenings. So if you wanna blame someone, welcome, I am here and I will stay listening. Unless you take things to the personal level, then feel yourself ignored.\r\n\r\nJust some things about myself, before I'll add my personal thoughts on the article.\r\n\r\nMy name is Michael Friedrich, spending my life in Austria, and have been working on NDOUtils Oracle since April 2009. Before that I got in touch with Nagios as well, but not affiliated with any special development in this area. Though, i'm a coder & hacker - still learning in various areas.\r\n\r\nBig fat remark: I do NOT sell Icinga affiliated products and generate money out of the project.\r\n\r\nWhen I heard about the fork named Icinga around start of May, I was investigating how to bring NDOUtils Oracle back to upstream (predecessor left the project). So I took my chance and wrote them, asking if it would be possible to develop on the Oracle support with team Icinga. For the time being, I was not one of the original forkers, but joined team Icinga on 15.5.2009 - while things were crazy about the fork and such.\r\n\r\nhttp://markmail.org/message/netso5mipngvspkz\r\n\r\nReading the Nagios mailinglists at that time already indicated that patches would have to last long, bug discussions lead to /dev/null and so on. So working independently on the code while following Nagios in the change was a pretty good idea from that past point of view. \r\n\r\nWhen Nagios opened up a bit, asking for developers, it was a rather logical idea to join their efforts. The very least I told Hendrik Baecker (who got NDOUtils lead developer later on - but sadly left the monitoring community after a while) that I would appreciate joining the NDOUtils team side by side with Icinga IDOUtils development. Keeping things the same would have opened the way for both worlds supporting Oracle in the very beginning. \r\n\r\nhttp://markmail.org/message/ntmpbo5twcrerti5\r\n\r\nThat stayed \"would\" because my offer was denied as Hendrik told me, not having sent a patch to Nagios nor having proven my capabilities of coding. That is truly a good answer - as it was true at that time - but well, seemed they did not want it. So yeah, Nagios could have gotten Oracle support as well. And later in September 2009, Postgresql too. But things did happen differently. Though never say that I did not offer help in the Nagios space as well, I will get to that later on a bit more.\r\n\r\nRegarding the topic on changing team members, and not having a stable basis. I've now read that in various interviews with Ethan, and right on i think it's time to explain some parts on that. \r\nI don't see a problem with a large team of open source enthusiasts, sharing the work load. Of course, project management starts to become a challenge but that's how successful projects work these days. The so-called \"one man show\" could be done, but once you fail to answer one, people will think differently about. I am not saying that organizing the core and addon code alone is a bad idea. Not at all - but such a project is more than just code. \r\n\r\nWhen users ask me what I want for the project, it's normally that I get \"... but I cannot program C or Perl\". Well tbh it's not really a language matter anymore. Icinga has evolved in so many different parts, that the actual coding is still important but does not add the last missing percents to the product Icinga users appreciate - for free, as we are a growing community.\r\nThe documentation has been reworked into docbook and fully translated into German - other languages are pending. While this adds a little more effort in actually writing XML than HTML, it value-adds the possibily to generate man pages and so on. The docs themselves are the knowledge backend of a project - so keep it updated. \r\nGenerating new ideas is not so easy when you are not actively diving through users support. So amongst the team there are various individuals working on the social media channels - to keep the twitter channel lively, actively read the mailinglists, filter feedback.icinga.org for new ideas, idle on IRC and help over there, organize development on the dev tracker, add entries to the wiki, write fancy blog post about interesting topics - in short: work with the community.\r\n\r\nThis work generates not only better docs and wiki entries. Ideas strive through the net, sometimes driven by Nagios users sharing their patches to the wild, or Icinga users having a patch around as well. All of this is taken into account side by side to personal demands - as well as work and friends.\r\nSo basically you will learn while reading on the dev tracker's history, that developers help each other as well as appreciate users reporting bugs, discussing about features and bugs and working it out. Every single release we've done so far. I know it - since 0.8.3 I'm the so-called \"Release Manager\" for the core parts. And I will take care about 1.7 as well - as I already did this week. \r\n\r\nWhile things were working pretty good, Nagios did get awake, true. The fork was not that bad at all, as two new valuable and much appreciated developers joined the core team - Ton Voon and Andreas Ericsson. Both did and do great work on the core. As Ethan did back in the days were it was not all about business and trademark guardianship. Lately Nagios releases became buggy and untested and it made me quite unhappy. As I am still supporting Nagios users this came a bit more to mind (mainly to learn from their problems and share that with Nagios and Icinga users then in a wiki entry for free - or yet better docs). \r\n\r\nI took the liberty to start digging around in the Nagios code again, thinking about the fact that Ethan and the project deserves sort of \"give something back\". It was not much that far, but yet I found my patches sometimes accepted. Some are still pending, especially those for NDOUtils, as you will see remarked on the bug and feature comparison. \r\n\r\nOh yes, I wrote that. You may ask why? Well mostly for the reason that the fancy comparisons mostly suck, each side wants to be better than the other, and that just because people demand a comparison.  I'm not really a fan of such things, and when Nagios Enterprises decided to throw their comparison charts with the infamous OpenNMS FUD ...\r\n\r\nhttp://www.adventuresinoss.com/?p=2324\r\nhttps://plus.google.com/114835305606981163109/posts/haB4ZWhE7az\r\n\r\n... I thought about doing something else than summarizing what the history got. The article does not really touch everything what happen. Some things happen apart from the public, only letting insiders recognize childish behaviour the most. \r\n\r\nE.g. threatening Olivier Jan for talking about Icinga on nagios-fr.org and demanding the domain to be transferred - well done, that's how the French Nagios community died.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.monitoring-fr.org/2010/02/accuse-nagios-fr-org-levez-vous/\r\n\r\nOf course after denying Shinken as Nagios rewrite, deleting it as official 1st ranked idea on ideas.nagios.org threatening Jean Gabes on license purposes.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.shinken-monitoring.org/news/shinken-integration-into-nagios-wont-be-possible/\r\nhttp://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_name=4C20D2A8.9040502%40nagios.com&forum_name=shinken-devel\r\n\r\nOne might recall the wikipedia edit orgy done by someone from Nagios Enterprises which led into a sockpuppet ban. Mostly it was for removing the mention of Icinga and Shinken as Nagios forks, while adding links to the commercial Nagios XI product (which is not free).\r\n\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nagios&action=history\r\n\r\nWhy I am adding this? Because I think people should know the truth about the stories that have happened. The article is also referring to the so-called \"trademark truth\". That topic is pretty hard, and emotional, as Nagios already got the issues back in 2002 with Netsaint. But, as a matter of fact, I do believe Julian when telling to protect misbehaviour in taking the Nagios trademark in Germany. Still, I think it was more a political affair to put pressure on the owner of a company participating in the same sector - selling Nagios consulting and being therefore competitor. What has happened in the background will (and should!) remain closed. Thing is, I do trust people I like, in this case the attacked side of the story. So i asked myself why this head to come to public. \r\n\r\nhttp://community.nagios.org/2010/09/28/nagios-trademark-truth/ http://community.nagios.org/2010/10/25/nagios-trademark-victor/\r\n\r\nhttp://www.netways.de/de/info/trademark/\r\n\r\nEven selling that as \"trademark win for the community\". As a community member, it was a \"wtf do i need a trademark for?\". But anyways, they got their trademark back and nagiosexchange.org died. And the business process addon died as well as it was hosted on nagiosforge.org - that domain was also transferred back to Nagios Enterprises. So thanks for nothing in that case - google's url ranking is a bitch. The new url is btw here\r\n\r\nhttp://bp-addon.monitoringexchange.org/\r\n\r\nAnyhow. I was enlightened lately, that Nagiosql is not listed as \"featured\" on nagiosexchange anymore because it supports Icinga as well. Same happened to pnp4nagios a while back too. So adding censorship to possible unwanted addons? Nice try.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of censorship, I cannot send mails to their lists anymore. Possibly I've talked too much about Icinga myself there. Though, such a limitation prevents me from investing my spare time into porting patches from Icinga to Nagios. I understand a lot of things in this hell area, but that - hell no.\r\n\r\nThe funny part about telling that forks are evil - creating their own open software license which forbid to fork their code - is more or less that the so-called Nagios Core Config Manager is a fork of the popular NagiosQL config addon. Freely available and developed. Or the Nagios SNMP Trap Receiver - a fork of NagTrap. Developed my Michael Luebben - see article above. Or Nagios Mobile - a fork of Teeny Nagios. \r\nSo you'll see - the real truth about forks is somewhere else. Possibly more with the feeling that someone else has success with things you did. \r\n\r\nBack to the comparison matrix. I did not want to tell people the above all over, why a fork and so on. I wanted to show them what we actually did. And yeah, the comparison only mentions the Nagios bug ids which I found. Much of it happened either on the famous nagios-portal.org or ideas.nagios.org or found on the net. And truly, Icinga looks better there than Nagios. Sure. But it was also my idea to share it for both sides. Recent Nagios SVN commits show that this idea was not lost as Eric Stanley is taking Icinga patches into Nagios Core (keep in mind that dnsmichi/Michael Friedrich stands for Icinga).\r\n\r\nhttp://nagios.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/nagios/nagioscore/trunk/?view=log\r\n\r\nFor what it's worth, I have to add - if Andreas Ericsson would not be such an heroic and enthusiastic programmer, the Nagios core code would be dead. I opt to call \"Nagios Core\" now \"op5 Core\" given the commits and time happened in the past year. So maybe I will change my opinion again and send an Icinga patch back to Nagios after 1.7 has been released. Overall, I might have missed all the Nagios story happening from 1999 - 2009 therefore having a different opinion on things that have happened.\r\n\r\nSo don't get me wrong - I appreciate what happened when things were \"normal\". But recent behaviour especially of Nagios Enterprises does not make me believe that Nagios is about community anymore. At least not the OSS community.\r\n\r\nEither way - I'm hoping that this reflection of the happenings will be the last one. History now closed for all those interested in it.\r\n\r\nAnd while the comparison matrix is updated once in a while, we focus on the real stuff. See those entries showing the activity\r\nhttps://dev.icinga.org/projects/icinga-development/activity\r\n\r\nI have to admit, I pretty much like ohloh and gource to visualize activity.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.ohloh.net/p/icinga\r\nhttps://www.icinga.org/2011/01/20/icinga-development-visualized-by-gource-revisite/\r\n\r\nFor gods sake, there's an active Icinga community, and the most famous plugins and addons are Icinga compatible. Sometimes directly in touch with the developers, and for what it's worth, also with the packagers, spreading the love into the package managers out there. Probably there are some addons which do not work with Icinga out-of-the-box. But that's not a problem - just get in touch with the Icinga community. I'm pretty sure we can find a solution - together.\r\n\r\nFor those not liking Icinga, and preferring other Nagios forks - Shinken, Centreon-Engine, Opsview, ... - go for it! Competition is always good, but keep the information exchange flowing - as I do with Jean from time to time, regardless of C vs Python.\r\n\r\nLast but not least - Netways is sponsoring our servers and invests man power into the project. As do other companies and Icinga supporters. That's how open source works today. I am happy that it is like that and not somewhat chaotic tool collection, failing to organize.\r\n\r\nAll available tools and subdomains are bound together as one and are dedicated to make devs and users life easy - to focus on the important things. And when we meet again - have time for some beers.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo, Icinga is alive and kicking. I am - still after 3 years. Are you? \r\n\r\n\r\n"
