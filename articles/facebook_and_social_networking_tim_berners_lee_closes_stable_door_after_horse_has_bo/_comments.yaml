    body: "At least we have a choice. I don't have to use Google, Face Book, Microsoft...I can actually choose which technologies I use and there is more genuine competition in the market as a whole. As long as that choice and competition is real why should I care if most people choose \"the dark side\"? In th 90s, the Windows monopoly was pretty well impossible to avoid. Now, I can and do avoid it. The situation is infinitely better now even if it isn't perfect and discrete advertising is to me a far better situation than lock-in to proprietary applications. Ok, it might not be simple to extract my data from Facebook but the truth is I rarely use Facebook and I wouldn't put anything really important there anyway so I can choose if and how I use those resources. The trend to open systems will further improve things but I doubt we will ever be free of commercial interests - if indeed complete freedom from commercial considerations is even desirable. The key is education so that people can make informed choices rather than adopting a sheep like mentality, but that is also true of the rest of life, not just technology.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIan"

    body: "The internet is a virtual planet.  It will reflect all that we see in the \"real\" world.  The history of the \"real\" world is replete with lessons regarding human behavior.  Natural selection is destiny, no matter what we think the future holds, its realization is only known when it is past and it never matches our imaginations.  The law of unintended consequences applies to everything which by definition reminds us that we ride the ocean of directionless evolution.  Whether we ride in storms or warm breezes, we are forever riding till we sink.  There is no landfall.  We like to think our behaviors both individually and collectively are somehow malleable by us to our own ends.  History provides no evidence of this.  Such thoughts are themselves the product of the uncountable contingencies that have made us what we are over millions of years.  Like hunger, sex etc they are drives which animate us.  Like our real planet, our virtual planet is filled with niches that provide the possibilities of satisfying our cravings.  Resource rich niches will result in growth to the limit and then the inevitable collapse.  We do not know yet what that collapse will look like on our virtual planet.  One might think that since it is virtual it can't collapse.  This is not true.  We won't know what it looks like till it is already past.  We already see on our virtual planet, revolutionaries, dictators, propaganda, apathy, true believers, force, commercialization, charity, bread and circuses.  Our virtual planet is a mirror of our \"real\" planet.  All that ever keeps us moving forward is the abstract drive of hope for some imagined future.  As chaos theory might put it, we are an uncountable collection of butterfly species, flapping our wings.  Who knows what weather will result ?\r\n"

    body: "The thing is you don't really have a choice about whether to use Facebook unless your contacts give you that choice (i.e. they have the choice, you don't).\r\n\r\nSo, if for example, I've been lazy and only created a Facebook account, rather than ones on Twitter, Identi.ca, and other social networking sites like I should (and this is in fact, true -- sorry, I'll be working on that in the new year), then I have given you only the option of 'friending' me on Facebook -- which means that if you want to interact with me on that level, you'll have to use Facebook too.\r\n\r\nOf course, we _collectively_ have a choice -- we can abandon the 500 million or so people on Facebook and create our own community (which is then effectively closed, even if the whole principle of it is \"open\").\r\n\r\nIt's a little simplistic to call that \"choice\". It's a little like how you have a \"choice\" to not drive a car or use fossil fuels, elecricity, or money: theoretically, yes; in reality, no -- the choice restricts too many other choices.\r\n\r\nSocial networking probably hasn't (yet) become as critical as those things, but it's getting that way, and that's the reason for concern. It will soon be a significant social disadvantage to not use such networks.\r\n\r\nThere really shouldn't be social networking \"sites\", there should be social networking \"protocols\" and simple tools to install these protocols on many sites. I believe there are people working on this, but they are lagging somewhat behind the commercial players, as Gary points out."

    body: "The topic about social networking is good, no doubt; but you're very wrong with your first example (introducing Russia and its \"well known\" undemocracy), Gary Richmond.\r\n\r\nThe fact is that Andrei Loshak works for popular Russian TV channel NTV. And you know what - the owner of the channel is the government of Russia, yessss, it is the government with Mr. Putin as its chairmen. And yes, Mr. Loshak speaks what a bad democracy we have and is not being dismissed at all. That is why I do not like modern journalists, especially political ones,- they are paid for the news, no matter of bad or good quality they are! If there are no news they begin to compose them from nothing.\r\n\r\nAt the same time I want to give you another, real bad example for the article: PayPal . Till now (2011) and on PayPal does not permit to receive money for citizens of Russia, only to spend. There is no tech reason behind it and your location matters only. And I do not like such a \"democracy\", it is plain racism AFAIK (meanwhile world economic crisis is still with us, and we have high unemployment here too).\r\n\r\nI am the author of FOSS application, Bombono DVD. And I has not been able even to receive the donation from one of my Italian users. Shame on you, PayPal.\r\n"

    body: "There is nothing vital on Facebook. I could quite happily live without it. It doesn't affect my work or anything I really need to do. Ok, there are degrees of choice but I'd put social networking down as unproven in terms of social disadvantage, at least in terms of specific sites in the longer term. I choose to use LinkedIn rather than Facebook but I could use Plaxo or something else. Look at how quickly Facebook displaced MySpace. I can choose to ring up my friends and talk to them but then I have to use a phone so I am probably forced to use an ARM design in the processor. That is probably more significant than being forced to use FB.\r\n\r\nIan"
