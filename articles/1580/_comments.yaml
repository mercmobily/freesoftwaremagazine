    body: "The difference between the pseudo-3D of \"stacked\" windows, which I've had on my desktop for years, and the pseudo-3D of slightly transparent stacked windows generated by a 3D controller, is basically that the text is harder to read on the transparent windows.\r\n\r\nREAL applications of 3D (such as an operating system metaphor of rooms and halls -- a \"dungeon\" as it were) or more compelling metaphors requires a lot of thought that doesn't seem to have been done. It's possible that it isn't really meant to be, IMHO. After all, we can only actually see 2D at once, so the advantage to a 3D environment remains marginal.\r\n\r\nOf course, a true immersive 3D virtual reality environment has possibilities -- but I don't think anybody is offering that just yet.\r\n\r\nI would predict that if there is a breakout 3D model, it'll come from hackers experimentation, and not from a market leader like Microsoft. And I predict there will be much wreckage of failed attempts before there is anything like success.\r\n\r\nPart of the problem is that, while 3D graphics have gotten quite reasonably priced, the controllers are much stickier.\r\n\r\nOne of the great reasons for the success of the mouse is that it is extremely cheap to make (e.g. digitizer pens and tablets are far higher fidelity, but are still expensive enough that most people don't bother with them).\r\n"

    body: "Are you one of the rare few who is using your computer with a digitizer pen and tablet?\r\n\r\nNot many people buy them, so there must not be many people who put enough value on them. The message of the market seems to be \"the mouse is good enough\".  I suppose some people might be persuaded to add a game controller instead (would that help?) (those are still pretty cheap).\r\n\r\nMy point is that 3D must either offer a compelling new interaction experience, or the input hardware must be extraordinarily cheap. So far, most 3D hardware is more than $100 a unit, so it's still far from \"a few extra dollars per unit of mass production\".  Maybe that's merely a matter of production runs, but so far, I haven't seen the breakout product.\r\n\r\nI was expecting something like the \"Spaceball\" to take off, but it still seems to be a pretty niche-oriented product (maybe it's because they never release free software drivers!).\r\n\r\nI'm also interested in 3D interfaces, but after a lot of years of hype (and none of the reality), I've become skeptical.\r\n"
