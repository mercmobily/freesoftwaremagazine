    body: "RE: Jabari Zakiya on The emerging FOSS revolution in Cuba\r\n\r\nOnline on: 2007-02-27\r\n\r\nLONG LIVE LINUX!   DOWN WITH CASTRO!\r\n\r\nHaving lived Massachussetts, I can understand Richard Stallman's leftist apologista's tendencies, however that does not make his trip to Cuba less hipocritical. By clamoring about Cuba's political system you are clamoring a regime who makes it a point to suppress dissent of any kind in the most repressive ways. A regime that has been talking the talk about being underdeveloped before the \"Revolution\" yet in reality has managed to make the country less developed than before the \"Revolution\". Stallman and others that support Castro are the Neo-Ugly Americans, portraying the Cuban populace almost as children who cannot know better and need to be \"told\" what to do, ergo per the Communist State's edict must view life as \"four legs are good\" .. \" two legs are bad\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Cuba is the rough diamond of the western-southern hemisphere. \"\r\nCuba had been known for many decades before the \"Revolution\" as the \"Pearl of the Antillies\" and was trying to get its lustre back in order when the Castro brothers usurped the \"Revolution\"; with the result that it was sent back into the \"Extremely Rough\" category.\r\n\r\n\"Intentionally neutered by almost 50 years of U.S. foreign policy, Cuba has still been able to create one of the world's highest literacy rates\"\r\nCuba had a relatively high literacy rate (85+%) and was well on its way to full literacy before the \"Revolution\" the main reason Castro put additional emphasis on literacy programs was to attempt to indoctrinate citizens into his mold, again \"a la\" the Animal Farm \"four legs are good\" .. \" two legs are bad\" i.e. tow the party line. It did not work; it does not work. But FUD and killing do work, ergo they are still in power.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"provide free health care to all its citizens, \"\r\n\"Free\" comes with a price, Cubans are TAXED AT A 99+% RATE and what do they get for that in medical care? ... hospitals that lack all the bare essentials, including soap, linen, medicines, toilet tissue and light bulbs, yes light bulbs! All of these \"amenities\" you must bring to the hospital with you and guard them with your life lest they be stolen! One tends to view these things in a different light when the \"FREE\" medical system kills your relatives as it has done to two of mine. Where do you go for redress? There is none!\r\n\r\n\"and exports more doctors than any other nation. \"\r\nWhat about the quality of those doctors? Castro has always been more than boastful (propaganda IS his favorite topic) than the reality has proved. Cuba has had a proud and distinguished \"cadre\" of medical pressionals for almost two centuries, yet in the  \"Revolution\" your quality as a doctor is measured first as your quality as a \"Communist\" towing the party line, not your medical/scientific credentials. This has been very aptly documented by Venezuelan doctors who had to help Cuba out of a medical crisis in the early nineties due to malnutrition, of all things!\r\n \r\n\r\n\"Now Cuba stands on the precipice of a revolution in the use and development of free and open source software. This will not only likely have dramatic effects on the internal politics of the nation, but also lead to Cuba's next significant export -- free and open source software.\"\r\nHow can working on software which is open sourced lead to changes in the internal politics of a totalitarian nation? It can't. Slave labour has been the bane of totalitarian systems throughout the 20th century and it is the norm in Cuba today. Programmers in Cuba may work on what the state tells them to work on and nothing else, lest they run afoul of any of \"CASTRO's LAWs\". Cubans do not have the right to: a home computer, an internet connection, free association, cell phones, foreign magazines, foreign press, a free press, nor entering hotels in the island (these are reserved for tourists); nor contact with foreigners unless approved by the government, nor buying in shops for tourists unless approved by the government, ad infinitum on freedoms that we take for granted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"On Valentines Day (2007/2/14) Richard M. Stallman (RMS) visited Havana, Cuba to address an international conference on technology. As reported in Cuba Embraces Open-Source Software he warned against the traps of proprietary software (security concerns, high costs, legal restrictions, planned obsolescence) and extolled the virtues and benefits of FOSS. RMS's message was heard, and heartily received, by the highest officials of the Cuban government, which is already focusing increased people and academic resources into FOSS development. Yes, Cuba is about to embrace FOSS in a big way.\"\r\nThe only thing the Cuban government embraces in a big way is CONTROL, PROPAGANDA AND MORE CONTROL!\r\n\r\n\"For Cuba, the security issues is very real. After all, the U.S. has an openly hostile foreign policy toward it, and lest people forget, the U.S. has invaded Cuba at least once (Bay of Pigs), has a military base on its land (Guantanamo Bay), and has made multiple assassination attempts against Castro. Also, while being subjected to a continuing U.S. economic embargo, Cuba has to make do with old computers and software, thus is required to get the most out of its physical infrastructure, a capability FOSS excels at.\"\r\nActually, the only time the U.S. has \"invaded Cuba\" has been during the Spanish American War (1898-1902) and in 1906-1907 to put down a small but loud rebellion (for example see http://historicaltextarchive.com/sections.php?op=viewarticle&artid=259). The Bay of Pigs was not an invasion but a fiasco orchestrated by Richard Stallman's senator's inept brother using Cubans not Americans. The U.S. embargo does not prevent Cuba from trading with the rest of the world, which it does; it is just that under the Castro brothers the economy is so mismanaged that the country has become impoverished and dependent on handouts which are harder and harder to come by (after 48 years of the same thing). That's the reason for the old computers and software, not the embargo. Taiwan, China, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, Japan, Korea, Brazil, South Africa even just about all of South America and Europe will sell them anything they want including computers, they just have to bring cash (which they don't have because the brothers Castro have wastefully spent).\r\n\r\n\"Cuba is following the lead of Hugo Chavez in Venezuela, who mandated the use of \"Software Libre\" in the government about 3 years ago, see here and here. But while Venezuela may have a headstart Cuba probably has the more literate, focused, and organized \"brainpower\" to become an open source juggernaut. In fact, its Cuba educational system that is in the process of allowing it to leapfrog every other country in Latin and South America. Cuba already offers free medical school education to people from all over the world (and specifically to African-Americans), and I can see it gradually offering free FOSS degrees too. Imagine Cuba not only being able to export doctors to the Caribbean, South/Central America, and Africa, but specialist in FOSS and IT too. \"\r\nGive me a break. Not that there are no Cubans with skills that may be applicable to FOSS, but literacy? Again, you stretch the Cuban government's propaganda too much. You don't really advance in Cuba unless you tow the party line, unless you are a good and \"faithful\" party member. There is a dearth of those that fit both categories i.e. of skilled in FOSS or general IT and are good Communists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"And this is where the Linux mantra of 'world domination' may play itself out in political reality. As Chavez nationalizes Venezuela's resource infrastructure, it is the marrying of Cuban brainpower with Venezuela's oil power that could produce an IT (Intelligence Technology) economy that can become a base of economic development throughout the developing world. Throw in the access to Chinese/Taiwanese developed cheap computers, cheap memory/monitors from South Korea (Samsung) and Japan, emerging manufacturing capacity in Africa, and within a decade there may be a world where most of its people will never have used a Windows based computer. Now that would be a real World Revolution.\" \r\nOne can only wish all the best to any Cuban under Castro that want's or \"is allowed\" to contribute to FOSS, however, it's a bit of a stretch to marry \"Cuban brainpower with Venezuela's oil\" other than the fact that it is Venezuela's oil and (mainly) Canadian and European tourists that prop the Castro regime's economy these days. There are many, many more people around the world involved in FOSS and with the freedom to get involved with FOSS than Cubans who might be allowed to delve in FOSS. Although probably few nations have a population with as much FREE time since the Cuban economy is starving for industry that is marketable world wide (and which is totaly controllable by the government). Also, given the nature of FOSS, they will have a lot of competition. For that, you can start in Mexico and work your way down through Central and South America. That is real and that is now!\r\n\r\n\r\n\"However, the use of FOSS will also invariably effect the daily social structure of Cuba, which is sure to cause tensions. The most prominent area of tension will be around the access, use, and control of the Internet. As a country under constant siege by the U.S., Cuba will have to go through the growing pains of allowing for the natural desire of its citizens to use what the Internet offers, while controlling its use based on national imperatives.\"\r\nPlease do provide examples, not just parrot propaganda. No apologies, please! Where is the siege by the U.S.? Castro has aptly and ably suppressed all dissent via FUD, jails and outright killing and murder throughout the past 48 years (mainly with the help of the Soviet Union but also the world at large who buys into his propaganda). What are the national imperatives? Who decides that? Who decides what these are? Certainly it is not the cuban population at large that is deciding that, but a minority of 1-5% that belong to the Communist Party and Run the country a-la wishes of the Castro brothers. Should a \"FREE\" elecorate be a national imperative for any country but Cuba? \r\n\r\n\r\n\"Ultimately though, I think the opening up of the Cuban people, and government, to the outside world, through the Internet and information technology, will be a net plus to Cuba. I think Cuba will figure out how to do it so as not to lose its political, cultural, and ideological identity, and can assimilate selective elements of global culture to use for its own benefit. In fact, I think Cuba has more to eventually give to the world than what it will receive from it.\"\r\nThe problem is that you (and many others that buy into what the Cuban Government tells them) have not figured out is that as far as Fidel Castro is concerned HE IS CUBA AND CUBA IS HIM. And he (though he may be in his last year, or so) and his co-horts have only figured out how to make some in the world believe that Cuba's political, cultural, and ideological identity should be theirs and theirs only; even though the populace at large may be against any of it. Therefore, YES, AND HERE YOU ARE RIGHT!, Cuba may have \"more to give the world than what it will receive from it\" because what the Castro brothers want is for their populace to work for them as slaves who bring in foreign exchange to prop up their disastrous economy; so nothing external that changes that will be allowed! Remember the 99+% tax rate? that is real! Remember the lousy FREE medical system? That is real to every Cuban that has to live there as a Cuban of the lower class, yes lower class! Remember what those in the Soviet Union and those under them in Eastern Europe used to say 1) Here everyone is equal, yes equally poor, 2) We pretend to work because \"they\" pretend to pay us!\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Finally, hopefully in this decade, after the current U.S. administration is relegated to the history bin, a more enlightened and humanitarian policy will emerge from the U.S., which will allow Americans to share and benefit from Cuban software development. It will happen indirectly anyway, when Cuban software migrates into the international FOSS world. But when the creativity and ingenuity of the Cuban people is freely able to manifest itself via FOSS, the average Cuban's quality of life will only increase, as will their sense of freedom, and their connection to the global community. \"\r\nThat enlightened and humanitarian policy was in place during the Carter adminstration (1976-1980). Today Cuba can buy food and medicines from the United States with hard currency. There is plenty of material online for you to find out what that has brought. These things have certainly not made life for Cubans any better because of the CONTROL that Castro exerts. Things have only been getting progressively worse for the Cuban populace every year since the \"Revolution\". The only historical binning necessary for real change in Cuba is the exit of the Castro brothers and their co-horts. Then you might have a chance to see some common sense in the governance of that land. If Cubans working under the Castro regime contribute to FOSS then the world benefits, including Americans.  \r\n\r\nYour misunderstanding of Fidel Castro's (and now his brother) grip on power is understandable and pitiful at the same time. HIS CONTROL IS ABSOLUTE. ABSOLUTELY MAKE NO MISTAKE ABOUT IT. \r\n"

    body: "Regarding LONG LIVE LINUX! DOWN WITH CASTRO!\r\n\r\n<p>Thank you for taking the time to respond individually to the points I made. Though I don't agree with about anything you said, at least you apparently read what I wrote and were moved to respond directly to them. I hope now you, and others,  (and I wish people would not hide behind the cloak of anonymity when making posts), would also take the time to objectively assess my additional comments.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You seem to be particularly driven by, may I say, a hatred for Fidel Castro. Why? Should I assume that spills over to the Cuban people too?\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Cuban Revolution (not the Castro Revolution) freed the Cuban people from a corrupt former despotic government which allowed Cuba to be a US colony and corporate plantation, mafia stronghold, and rich peoples playground.  Do you not agree?  And because the majority of the Cuban people supported the expulsion of these oppressive entities from their homeland, a small band of rabid, fanatical, megamaniacal fascist \"conservative\" in the US have commandeered US policy toward Cuba, even though the majority of americans, and even secretly most in Congress, sees the policy as stupid and unconstructive. And the US policy has gotten worse and more fanatically rabid under the Bush regime.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You seem to ignore that it was the US that invaded Cuba and repeatedly attempted to KILL Castro, funded terrorist operations against Cuba (remember Louis Pasada, who the US won't turn over to Venezuela for bombing a Cuban airliner), pump propaganda into Cuba everyday via Radio Marti, ban most Americans from traveling to Cuba and using US currency there, imposed an economic embargo which has hurt US farmers more than Cuba, and in general, just acted like a slave master who's pissed because he can't get back the plantation he used to own.  Tough! Get over it and GET A LIFE!\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You also seem to ignore it is the US, not Cuba, who imprisons more of its citizens (2.2 million and counting) than any other country in the world, most of whom are Black and Brown people, doesn't provide any healthcare to at least 50 million citizens, and accessible healthcare to at least 75 million, tortures people with impunity, and of course, reserves the RIGHT to invade any nation for any reason, because it can.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You seem to forget it wasn't Castro (or Mao, or Ho Chi Minh, or Stalin) who said \"the United States is the greatest purveyor of violence in the world\" it was (assassinated) Nobel Peace Prize winner Dr. Martin Luther King (who was surveiled and harassed with US citizens tax payers dollars by the J. Edger Hoover run FBLies).\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, who is spewing propaganda? Me, because I acknowledge historical facts and their consequences, or you?  I'm really puzzled by responses like yours. What has Castro, or the Cuban revolution, actually done to hurt you? Anything, other than assault your self-claimed sense of superiority?\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But things in Cuba, and the US, are changing toward the better.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cuba recently held a state sponsored <a href=\"http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070304/ap_en_mo/cuba_open_to_criticism\"> film festival</a> where open criticism was expressed about Cuban life.  Of course, much of the economic hardship and harshness of Cuban life is a direct result of the consequences of US economic and foreign policy (the US also pressure other countries to screw Cuba too).\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When the Bush regime goes, so too most likely will be the anachronistic US policy toward Cuba,\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>See these <a href=\"http://www.thecubatopten.com\">Top Ten Reasons</a> to change the policy.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n    * The policy has produced nothing in decades\r\n    * Enforcing the policy drains resources from the war on terror\r\n    * The policy hurts American companies and American workers\r\n    * The policy is an assault on family values\r\n    * The policy infringes on the rights and liberties of all U.S. citizens\r\n    * The policy hurts America’s image abroad\r\n    * The Castro government uses our policy to advance its own ends\r\n    * The policy puts political interests above the national interest\r\n    * Important people oppose the policy and want to see it changed\r\n    * The policy stops Americans from doing what they do best\r\n\r\n<p>Please download the article off the website and read it. If you really care about the Cuban people maybe you will start to think about how to help them, versus revel in your hatred for Castro.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oh, and before you get too giddy about the eminent demise of Castro, when he does die, the Cuban revolution and government will still keep chugging along. Again, it was, and is, a Cuban revolution, not a Castro revolution. And when the Cuban people are able to live and make decisions without the jackboot of American policy keeping it from rising and flourishing, it will begin to manifest its full potential. Now wouldn't that be a marvelous thing for people who value freedom?\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And free and open source software will be one of the tools that will allow Cuba to grow and prosper. Like it is doing everywhere in the world its being used, it will also raise the quality of life for everyone in the society, whether they know it or not, whenever people use their phone, access documents, or listen to music. Like the air, they will feel its presence even though they can't see it.\r\n</p>\r\n"

However, I doubt if Castro had anything to directly do with that.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the writer's tirade against the Cuban medical system, and quality of doctors, is manifestly factually false.  Unlike the US, Cuba has a true \"health care\" system (which promotes prevention and early intervention), where we in the US have a \"sick care\" system (the system only cares for and about you when you get sick). The Cubans, who understand the health of their people is a \"right\" and national priority, tries to keep people healthy, so as not to have to resort to expensive sick care treatment, which it can't afford to provide on a large scale. And the results are that the average Cuban is absolutely more healthy than the average American. Just recently Americans came in near the bottom in an international health/fitness survey.
