Nevertheless, sometimes I do find news that I haven't seen anywhere else.\r\n\r\nAnd besides, it's great to have a news hub with \"free\" in the title, and not \"open\". ;-)"

    body: "i subscribed to it in my rss reader (\"tiny tiny rss\" or tt-rss), but after a week or so i unsubscribed.\r\n\r\nwhy?  too much noise.  i don't know if anybody has found a good way to integrate rss with reader submitted/voted news sites (digg, etc).  i don't want to wade through all the lowly rated stories in my rss reader, but only the highly rated ones.  or at least i want to know which stories are which.  but stories appear in the rss feed shortly after they are added (or at least that is how they appeared in my rss reader), which is too early in the voting process to make a \"good\" or \"bad\" determination.  so i end up wading through tens of stories per day without the benefit of the community voting process.\r\n\r\nmaybe an updated-daily rss feed of the top rated stories from the previous day?  that would give the stories some time to amass votes and earn a (initial) good/bad score.\r\n\r\nbecause of the dynamics of a user voted news site, i don't know how to best combine an rss feed (static) with fsd (dynamic), but that what i saw with tt-rss and fsd didn't work for me."
