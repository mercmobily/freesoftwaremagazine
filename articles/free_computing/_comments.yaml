I've installed Puppy Linux and Win2K on two machines and in both cases Windows interface felt snappier and more responsive. Also, Windows didn't consume as much memory as the Linux distributions.\r\n\r\nHowever, if you plan to use it as a no monitor home server, than I'd recommend going with Damn Small Linux."

    body: "A very good article, especially when there is no hard drive; or when a person wants to keep the Windows OS already there, and not do any partitioning. There <em>is</em> a bit of fiddling around to get a session up and running from a cold start, but it's actually not too bad: The LiveCD goes into the CDRom drive, and if the CDRom drive is not bootable, a Smart Boot Manager floppy goes into the diskette drive. A USB pen-drive will save one's configuration settings and personal files. And does anybody really care that this fiddling-around looks unprofessional? I doubt it! Since Puppy, Slax and Damn Small are running in RAM, a person is done fiddling once the Linux has loaded. That's not the case, of course, with e.g. Knoppix, which has to reference the CD as work progresses. The only additional fiddling one might want to do with Puppy, Slax or Damn Small is have a swap <em>file</em> on the hard drive (if there is a hard drive). A swap <em>partition</em> would of course require partitioning. \r\n\r\nBut eventually, a person may want to do an actual installation of Linux onto the hard drive. It's not really clear from their respective web sites if Puppy, Slax or Damn Small <em>truly</em> lend themselves to a full (Unix-type) installation. See Mark Gjerde's article «Less Buzz More Fizz» at <a href=\"http://os.newsforge.com/article.pl?sid=06/03/08/1833211&tid=2\">Newsforge</a> (comments section). I've assembled Mr Gjerde's several articles into a single PDF at <a href=\"http://www.esnips.com/doc/6de0ccec-3ee9-4ffd-8c51-f27d71c00b42/GRML_Review\">zumGlockenturm</a> . Mr Gjerde likes Grml Linux. \r\n\r\nEven if Puppy, Slax or Damn Small can be successfully installed, it's not clear if the package add-ons work the same way as they do from LiveCD. Slax packages for example do seem specifically designed for the LiveCD mode. For a true Unix-type install onto hard drive, I've concluded it's better to go with a distro that's designed to <em>be</em> installed rather than one where hard-drive installation is a <em>feature</em>. For an actual installation of Linux onto a PII or PIII, good candidates besides Grml include Fluxbuntu (see Distrowatch) and <a href=\"http://www.pcbypaul.com/absolute/\">Absolute Linux</a> (not on Distrowatch). \r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.zumGlockenturm.org\">Roger</a>\r\n"

What is closing those ports if not a firewall? Semantics. How can you avoid downloading suspicious files when they could look like an image on a webpage and have pleasant names like fuzzy.jpg? Look what happened with the .ANI and others. Are you going to scan the files personally before passing them to IE? What a joke. Sure 2000 is better than some of the stuff out there but there is no way unmaintained software from MSFT will do anything faster than Linux except install malware.\r\n\r\nThe last time I worked with '2000 server, it needed rebooting so often the secretary knew how to do it. My Linux servers have always outperformed any Windows box I have had around to compare. They move more data per second on the same hardware, answer DHCP calls sooner, handle more simultaneous users and processes, cache files better, fragment discs less and I never have seen one crash from software I have installed and tested.\r\n\r\nA fanboy once told me he had a '2000 server that never crashed. He said he had set it up well and never changed anything on it. It crashed several times in the period I worked there when I sent print jobs through it. \r\n\r\nA problem is an opportunity."

    body: "One reason I favour using old boxes as thin clients of newer machines is that they are slower. An installation on a newish machine is limited by the speed of the CD drive or the network interface, not the CPU. The old machines may have a 4X CD, a 10 mb/s NIC and ATA33 IDE interface. A 12 minute installation of a full CD distro can take 2.5 hours on an old machine. The mini distros really help but a thin client is still better.\r\n\r\nAny place you need more than one machine, buy something cheap (in keeping with the theme of the article) and new to be a Linux terminal server. Install a second NIC if you want to be a firewall, too. Install Debian, K12LTSP, EdUbuntu, or something + LTSP and configure it to boot thin clients by PXE or etherboot. The old machines can slurp up a boot floppy (< 20 kb) loader and boot from the server from files cached in RAM on the server limited only by the 100 mb/s connection for speed. It takes less than a second to transfer the kernel image and initrd over and a few seconds to boot. I have seen P III with that other OS take a minute to boot from hard disk (spin up time, seeks plus more stuff to load), but as a thin client, boot in 20 s.\r\n\r\nFrom then on the user of the old clunker is running on the new machine and the old thing is only dealing with clicks and pix. It really is startling to see. People who are used to running on the old machine should be warned to avoid whiplash and other neck injuries. I am writing this from a PIII 500 MHz and I cannot tell the difference between this and running on the server itself. I have three seats on this one server and it could handle 30 if I had the equipment to connect. see <a href=\"http://www.freesoftwaremagazine.com/articles/linux_terminal_server\">Linux Terminal Server</a> in FSM.\r\n\r\nA problem is an opportunity."
