As far as I know, my parents don't have a chance of finding a Linux literate “computer guy”.

There are some distros that are designed for server use, some that designed for use on very small computers, some that are designed for use in extreme conditions and others that are designed for beginners on the desktop/laptop. GNU/Linux is for everyone not just the masses.\r\n\r\n<cite>\"Another thing I've noticed is there are as many distributions as there are christian church denominations. Cant anybody agree on anything?\"<cite>\r\n\r\nThe makers of the various distributions do agree... to disagree. They don't try and force anyone to do things \"their way\". They are quite happy doing things their own way. This is called freedom. Think about cars or cereal or icecream flavours? Why should everyone be stuck with only a couple of choices. There are over 6 billion people on this planet. They all have their own individual needs and tastes. Designing one system to suit everyone would be impossible. Choosing the right one for you is easy: if you are a beginner and you don't want to use have to use the command line and you want it to be easy to install applications then you should use the most popular distro there is at the moment - Ubuntu.\r\n\r\n<cite>\"If linux wanted to attract more people and not just the technically able,some user interface for installs would be a necessity for Grandma. Grandma has no knowledge of the command line.\"</cite>\r\n\r\nGrandma doesn't need to use the command line and neither do you. There are distros that are designed especially for beginners like Ubuntu. You shouldn't need the command line for Ubuntu at all. And, even if you do, it should only be a matter of cutting and pasting code straight off the Ubuntu website into your command line and hitting enter. If you can press Ctrl and C (copy) and Ctrl + V (paste) or use a mouse to copy and paste then you can use the command line too. You really don't need to know your way around at all. Trust me, I don't. I just follow the instructions I'm given by the guys who do know their way around. And it works.\r\n\r\n<cite>\"What are the easiest distros for installing programs?\"</cite>\r\n\r\nInstalling applications is very easy on Ubuntu (and quite a few other other distros too); it's, in fact, easier than with Windows. You don't even need install wizards, you just open a program called Synaptic Package Manager from the System->Administration menu, check a box next to the name of the application you want to install, and hit the Apply button. Then you have to hit okay once or twice and it downloads and installs the application for you, into the right locations and adds an entry in your menu. That's right! you don't even have to go looking on the net for the software to download. My 8 year old was shown how to do it once and now he installs applications (mainly games) on his own without a problem.\r\n\r\n<cite>\"Until some agreement can be made on whether linux is going to be for knowledgable computer user and for the unsavvy Grandma will have to wait.\"</cite>\r\n\r\nGNU/Linux is for everyone: hardcore techies, complete newbies, and everyone in between including grannies. If granny can use a computer she can use GNU/Linux.\r\n\r\nIf you managed to install SUSE then you will find Ubuntu just as easy if not easier and I would really urge you to try it. You can download the LiveCD and check it out. You can then use it as an install CD. If you can't download it they will send you one for free. \r\n\r\nIf you want to see how easy it is to use Synaptic Package Manager look <a href=\"http://www.freesoftwaremagazine.com/articles/synaptic_intro\">here</a>.\r\n\r\nIf you want to get flash going using Ubuntu you can install Automatix2 available <a href=\"http://www.getautomatix.com/\">here</a>. The instructions are very straight forward and can be found <a href=\"http://www.getautomatix.com/wiki/index.php?title=Installation\">here</a>. Simply find the instructions for your version of Ubuntu and follow them. It is simply a matter of copying and pasting and hitting Enter.\r\n\r\nI hope this helps."
