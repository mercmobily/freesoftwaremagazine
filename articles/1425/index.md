In a recent issue of the newsletter [“The Linux Executive Report from IBM”](http://www-1.ibm.com/linux/), Ubuntu is discussed in an article titled “Moving Beyond Red Hat and Novell SUSE”.

From the newsletter:


>“Since its launch in October 2004, Ubuntu has become one of the most highly regarded Linux distributions, with millions distributed and in use around the world. Based on Debian, Ubuntu will always be free, and will not have restrictive licenses associated with it.  Ubuntu aims at being the most widely used of all Linux systems, and is the center of a global open source software ecosystem.”

It seems that IBM understands the importance of a completely free Linux!
