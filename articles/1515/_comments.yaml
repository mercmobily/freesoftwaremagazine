They also have abiword, filezilla, gimp (though probably not with lots of plugins), and even XAMPP (Apache+PHP+MySql+PhpMyAdmin, LAMP without Linux).\r\n\r\nHmm, I could use that USB Drive with XAMPP to demo some web developent stuff to my customers, without actually putting on a public site. And Linux is \"coming\", although that means that they'll need to start creating two versions of everything (a Windoze version, plus a Linux version). My old computers don't boot from USB, I don't know how that works... maybe a boot CD, plus the USB drive?\r\n\r\nAnyway, I think that they've got most of the stuff I use... except K3B, and games. And I don't need MORE access to computer games, do you?\r\n\r\nWhat else did you have in mind?"

    body: 'I have a USB stick with about 50 portable applications running without U3. I cannot see the real advantage of U3. It saves me one click I guess, but at the same time it creates other problems. Like warning me that I may have to restart the computer, locking up, stores the apps with hashed up ids, etc, etc. Why not keep it simple? '

You can 'reset' the device, but that deletes everything on the drive.  I'm sure there are ways to recover crap off the disk, but most folks just don't have that kind of time or knowledge so I'm not too terribly concerned about my lost stick.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This really does nothing more that create a shortcut for you, but isn't this what you want anyway?  Simple UI for convenience and it does all the work for you.  Props to the coder.\r\n\r\nAnd I personally like the U3 drives.  Yes, it does take a bit to get used to, but a ported program becomes easier to manage and integrated rather than using other launchers and managing it all yourself.  Just one less thing to think about for me."
