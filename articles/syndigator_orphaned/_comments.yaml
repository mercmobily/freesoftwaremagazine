    body: "Liferea was one of the aggregators I tried, maybe it's one year ago, and that left me quite unsatisfied: too buggy, too unstable... just worked like a beta.\r\n\r\nRSSOwl, I didn't know it. It looks interesting, even if it's Java :-) (just kidding). I'll give it a try.\r\n\r\nThanks for posting!\r\n\r\nCiao!\r\n--bronto"
