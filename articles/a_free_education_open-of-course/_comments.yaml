    body: "Hmm...I wonder if they'd be interested in the many materials I've put online (licensed under the GPL) for my university courses in English and rhetoric. I browsed the offerings, but most appear to be based on computer literacy, not English literacy. ;-) Sadly, that's usually the way these things go--I have truly \"non-techie\" course materials, but who's interested? ;-)\r\n\r\nReally, though, I had great luck with my <a href=\"http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Rhetoric_and_Composition\">Rhetoric & Comp Wikibook</a>, which even won the Wikibook of the Month Award in October. I'd love to have statistics of the people who've used this book."
