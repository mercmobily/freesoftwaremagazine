    body: "Dang, _I_ was going to write about typesetting a book with Scribus. :-)\r\n\r\nI typeset my Free Software Magazine book [Achieving Impossible Things with Free Culture and Commons-Based Enterprise](http://fsmsh.com/2770\r\n) using Scribus 1.3.3.13svn. I just used the Debian package version, but I found it entirely adequate to my needs.\r\n\r\nExcept... that limit on number of pages is a killer! I found that 20-30 pages was the practical limit, especially when you have a lot of illustrations.\r\n\r\nIt's not so bad to assemble chapters together with pdftk, but the work involved in synchronizing styles between a couple dozen layout files is excessive. Scribus really needs some kind of book-level management tools.\r\n\r\nOther than that though, it was really a lot of fun to work with.\r\n"

    body: "Hi Terry,\r\n\r\nI'd be interested to hear about your experience, so please write that post if you have the time. I'd recommend the official Scribus 1.3.3.13 Stable release rather than a svn package. It's an easy build from source, once you figure out they use cmake in preference to autotools.\r\n\r\nThe page limit is directly CPU related, I think because Scribus tries to render every page, all the time. I don't fully understand the reason for this design, because I used to typeset very long books on much slower Macs, and this was never a problem. The PDF output is the only really reliable proof, anyway.\r\n\r\nAs for style management, if you use the same Scribus file as the basis of each new chapter, then the master pages will all be the same. However, if you subsequently modify a master page, you'll have to re-import the new version of the master page to each document in the project. Paragraph styles have to be managed in the same way - see the bottom five entries on the Edit menu; there is usually an Import button somewhere.\r\n\r\nIt would be better if Scribus could optionally 'subscribe' to a master page or style sheet so that changes could be adopted automatically. There may be a way to do that with the current release, but I haven't found it yet.    "
