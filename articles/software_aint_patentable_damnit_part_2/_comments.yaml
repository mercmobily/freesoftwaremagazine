    body: 'I have been following the IP infringement word battle like everybody else.  It''s great to see that finally there is some legally sanctioned methodology for dealing with this issue.  It has taken a long time for the court system to finally realize that the patent office had given up its constitutional duties thereby making it incumbent on the courts to rectify this situtation by taking over that oversight.  I''m now waiting for the outcry that the court is being "activist".  This will tell us who has the most to lose and I suspect that Microsoft won''t be the only one howling.  There are probably numerous small companies that have been playing this game that we don''t even know about all of whom have been feeding at the government trough.  Hopefully this will also be the begining of some long needed reform of corporate welfare.  It will be a little harder than attacking unmarried minority women with children but I''m minutely hopeful.'
