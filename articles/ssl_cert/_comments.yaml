    body: "Okay this is fairly old article but I thought I'd mention for anyone coming here since - that Spoofstick is  very good extension/plugin for both IE and Firefox. ( http://www.spoofstick.com/ ).\r\n\r\nIt displays the domain of the current site on your menubar (or where you choose it to be). So when you think you are going to www.paypal.com and you are actually visiting www.paypal-com-cgi-bin.biz - spoofstick displays a clear \"You're on www.paypal-com-bin.biz\" on your browser in big letters.\r\n\r\nVery useful.\r\nRyan"
