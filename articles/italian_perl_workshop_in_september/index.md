The guys at [Perl.it](http://www.perl.it) are at it again! The fourth Italian Perl Workshop is taking place next September in Pisa, Italy.

<!--break-->

As you can guess, the conference is in Italian, so if you plan to attend you'd better know how to speak Italian (or take lessons in the next two months!).

For those of you that are interested in IPW2008, I recommend you watch the [conference web site](http://conferences.yapceurope.org/ipw2008/index.html) for updates.

The date is September 18th, make a note!

See you in Pisa.
