There’s an interesting link on [News Forge](http://business.newsforge.com/article.pl?sid=05/12/16/1444201&from=rss) today to [this article about FOSS insurance](http://www.itmanagersjournal.com/article.pl?sid=05/12/16/1443200). The issue here is whether it’s advisable for companies using FOSS to take out insurance policies protecting them against possible FOSS-related patent infringment. This article doesn’t really take a position, but does provide some considerations for IT managers.
