_**Apress, O'Reilly, Addison-Wesley/Prentice Hall, No Starch Press** sponsor Free Software Magazine by donating books to FSM to pay contributors with._

The title says it all: four major publishers put their money where their mouth is, and have agreed to sponsor Free Software Magazine.

Their commitment is to donate one book (max $100) for each article that gets published in Free Software Magazine (excluding book reviews and articles less than 1000 words in length).

We are very excited about this new deal. It means that we can give something _tangible_ back to our authors. This is only a beginning: we will try to extend the number (and type) of sponsors, so that we are able to give more and more to our authors.

We will never be able to thank our sponsors enough for helping us maintain Free Software Magazine, and hope that their sponsorship will help us improve Free Software Magazine even further.

Thank you!
