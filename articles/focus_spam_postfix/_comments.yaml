The use of <strong>reject_unauth_pipelining in the other restriction contexts is therefore not recommended.</strong>"

Since we don't have too many Outlook clients, it was pretty easy to add the individual machines to my helo_access file.  I grabbed the HELO identification from the Outlook error message that popped up when a user tried to send a message (this is also available in the log file).  Then I put an entry in helo_access as follows:\r\n\r\nmachine_name   OK"

I have dropped spam making it through the e-mail server by 80-90%.  my bayesian filter (I use spamprobe) takes care of the rest, and since I put those additions into my e-mail server *knocks on wood* I haven't gotten any spam into my inbox.  yeah!\r\n\r\nand my end users of mailing list  run are ecstatic as well.\r\n\r\nbut RBLs, the mission statements sound good, but in practice, I don't see them actually living up to them."
