    body: "anyone who reads the article will come to the same obvious realizations you have,\r\n\r\n\tthey correctly place times, quotes, and positions.  Linus has not been in favor of GPLv3 and has been quite vocally against it, so their quote is just fine.  *is subscribe to the kernel-dev mailing list*, &Linus has stated how he feels there many times.  so no, maybe like this isn't 'this weeks' open source news, its more like; and 'yeah like so what else is new.  but keep in mind that information week is anything but a FLOSS journal, so that they're late to the news should hardly surprise anyone.  and as for _some_ `slashdotters' not reading the story and actually connecting any of the facts.  well 'yeah like so what else is new' and 'this should hardly surprise anyone.\r\n\r\n\tbut look you mentioned Information Week and the GPLv3(&by association Linus and the \"hypocrites\" quote) like all in just your post's title.  wtg on ensuring that you'll be linked to high heaven.  i like so wish i had though of that; but i've been distracted by all the pretty code ;-)"
