  LINUS CALLS [GPLv3](http://fsfeurope.org/projects/gplv3/)  "A FINE CHOICE" - is a title that InformationWeek could  have used for their article.  It would have been very selective  quoting, but that doesn't seem to be a problem for InformationWeek.  Nor does pretending that old emails are new emails, or  misrepresenting people.

  In reality, there is no news.  Their article contains nothing at all  that is new since GPLv3's June 29th release.  I thought this  clarification was worthwhile because  Slashdot [has  now featured that article](http://linux.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/07/13/2123235), and from looking at the comments, it  seems that most readers have been fooled into thinking this is some  new statement from Linus.

**News? Olds?**

  The article starts with "_Free Software Foundation last month  published a revised version of the General Public License_"  - framing the article as post-GPLv3 news.  It then proceeds to  present quotes from Linus, without mentioning that they're from a  June 20th email - that's not just old, it's from before GPLv3 was  even published.

  At the very end of the article, the June 20th date is mentioned in  relation to one quote - but only that one quote.  It's not mentioned  that the whole story has just been a creative rehash of that one old  email.

**Misrepresentation**

  Of course, InformationWeek don't give readers a link  to [Linus's actual  email](http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/6/20/223).  Besides being able to see that date that the quotes were  taken from, readers could have seen that Linus's "_fanatics  and totalitarian states_" comment was part of a general  comment in a meandering discussion.  It was not, contrary to the  introduction of InformationWeek's article, part of a description of  the "executives of Free Software Foundation ... mind-set".

**Selective**

  I wonder how long it took them to decide not to quote this bit of  the email: "_I don't think it's hypocritical to prefer the  GPLv3. That's a fine choice, it's just not *mine*._" If they  have some objection to publishing balanced statements, they could  have just left out the last four words.

**Conclusion**

  We've see some real low quality journalism during the GPLv3 drafting  process.  Dan Lyons's stories in Forbes (which Slashdot also  featured) defined the low point.  The author of this InformationWeek  article, Paul McDougall, hasn't managed to stoop down to Lyons's  level, but he gets my nomination for 2nd place.

  Linus's position is clear.  He's repeatedly said that he'd use GPLv3  in certain situations if there was a practical advantage, but he  prefers v2 over v3.  That's fine.  I prefer v3, but v2 is still a  great licence.

  In related news, I just checked Groklaw and saw that PJ's latest  story is  [about  a different InformationWeek story which she finds misleading](http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20070713192403106), on  the topic of SCO, patents, and yet another claim about the end  of [free  software](http://fsfeurope.org/documents/freesoftware).
