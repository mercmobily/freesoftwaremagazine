    body: "At least you got a wiff of a wifi signal there.  In fact, prior to my recent experiance stuck at LA for a similar stretch, I thought of the airport in Sofia (Bulgaria) as the worst in the world, only because they had people with guns that said I could not go to the plane that day, even though the plane was on the ground, waiting, and I was a half hour before departure.  The driver of the bus that brings people to the planes did not want to make another trip...so I did not get to fly that day.  People with guns indeed was hard to beat.  But yet LA was worse.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the first and most immediate challenge in LA is navigation.  I got in around gate \"62\" with what was originally a \"short\" connection, I think, and had to go to something like gate \"74\".  Hmm...the segment I was in had numbers like 60 through 67.  The gate I wanted should be nearby, right??  No...Absolute other end of the airport!\r\n\r\nNot that it mattered, because the flight was on a ground hold, and would remain so for the next 6 hours, though I did not know this when I started out on that journey.  Terminals with departing flight information?  I don't recall encountering any.  Nor any bathrooms through 3 long walkways and several floors with escilators that did not work, and no attempt to even have people movers (which no doubt would not have worked there either if they had them...) until I did arrive into the little rabbit warren where the departing flight was hidden away.\r\n\r\nOther distinguishing features of LA airport that I learned over the next 6 hours included the fact that their departure areas have far less seats than the planes they load, at least one power outage (I never saw that at an airport before, either), gate people that either would come late for their other flights, or yell at people, oh, and incidently no wifi at all (at least that day, I do not know if they were down or just did not have it).  Overall a thourougly unpleasant experiance, even more so than people with guns, and behavior I have never seen repeated at any other airport anywhere in the world, even in Bulgaria.\r\n\r\n"

    body: "Hi there, I'm flying into MIA tomorrow from MAD, and I'm wondering if anyone knows whether the connection is still as bad as all that. I was planning on working in the airport on my way out of MIA next week, part of my pact with my boss for letting me go out of the office for a long weekend.\r\n\r\nBtw, FLL does have free wifi throughout its airport, and it works really well. The only issue with FLL airport is that they have blocked all of their wall outlets, so you need to sit next to a cash machine outside of the bathroom in order to keep your laptop going (unless you have a super-long life battery that will last you through the flight, as well). \r\n\r\nShouldn't all airports offer free wifi by now?"
