On a scale from 1-10 I would give this a 0!\r\n\r\nI think there are links to the three web pages the article speaks of. Those front pages there are more inticing than the article you just read.\r\n\r\nVery bad. Boo.\r\n\r\n________________________________________\r\n\r\n    From: Tony Mobily (SUBSCRIBER!)\r\n    Url: http://www.mobily.com\r\n    Date: 2006-01-25\r\n    Subject: Well...\r\n\r\n    Hello,\r\n\r\n    True, the article could have much more \"substance\".\r\n\r\n    However, it was meant to be a very short article about Ubuntu. There are loads of people out there who don't actually know that Edubuntu, Kumuntu etc. even exist...!\r\n\r\n    We will talk about Ubuntu more in the future. And yes, we'll do our best to publish interesting material!\r\n\r\n    Merc.\r\n\r\n    ________________________________________\r\n\r\n    From: Dave Guard (SUBSCRIBER!)\r\n    Url: www.freesoftwaremagazine.com\r\n    Date: 2006-01-25\r\n    Subject: I think you missed the links\r\n\r\n    Rory Griffin says:\r\n\r\n    \"I think there are links to the three web pages the article speaks of.\"\r\n\r\n    Have a look at each heading--they are also links. Each of the covered websites have links provided.\r\n\r\n    This article is supposed to be a brief run down of the sites you should look at if you are thinking of using Ubuntu or if you are interested in finding out more about Ubuntu.\r\n\r\n    I think it achieves this goal well.\r\n\r\n    Thanks for reading\r\n\r\n\r\n    ________________________________________\r\n\r\nFrom: Derek\r\nUrl:\r\nDate: 2006-01-24\r\nSubject: Where's the beef?\r\n\r\nYou started off by saying you will explore what makes Ubuntu popular so I was expecting some insight as to why I should try it, but instead, you have only provided some screen shots and talked about 2 other Ubuntu-based distribution.\r\n\r\n________________________________________\r\n\r\nFrom: John Doe\r\nUrl:\r\nDate: 2006-01-24\r\nSubject: There is better than Ubuntu\r\n\r\nKubuntu is nice, but an even better KDE based distro is at www.pclinuxonline.com.\r\n\r\nYou want a finished distro with everything self-configured, this is it.\r\n\r\nWord of mouth is the only thing makes Ubuntu/Kubuntu more popular. Once more peoplw starting finding PCLinuxOS, it definetally rise to the top.\r\n\r\nIt was started by Texstar who years and years ago was the one making those incredible updates for Mandrake.\r\n\r\n________________________________________\r\n\r\nFrom: Ryan\r\nUrl:\r\nDate: 2006-01-24\r\nSubject: Thats all?\r\n\r\nI think I could have found out all that information from the Ubuntu website. Where are the comparisons to other Debian based distributions, other Education based distributions. Why would someone want to use Ubuntu? That its Debian based and user friendly seems to hardly differentiate it from Linspire or other all-in-one desktop systems.\r\n\r\n________________________________________\r\n\r\n    From: Joe Anon\r\n    Url:\r\n    Date: 2006-01-25\r\n    Subject: Needs _some_ details. Anything.\r\n\r\n    I'm sorry but I have to agree. There is essential nothing of interest here. This is like someone passing you in the street and saying, \"Hey you should check out ...(something)\" , and not telling you why you should, or what is different or interesting about it. Even if it is to just let people know it exists.\r\n\r\n    ________________________________________\r\n\r\n        From: Tony Mobily (SUBSCRIBER!)\r\n        Url: http://www.mobily.com\r\n        Date: 2006-01-26\r\n        Subject: OK!\r\n\r\n        Hello,\r\n\r\n        OK.

You will also be saving some hard drive\r\n\r\nspace. This is the worst article that I've ever read in the\r\n\r\n10 years that I've been getting online.\r\n\r\n________________________________________\r\n\r\n    From: Tony Mobily (SUBSCRIBER!)\r\n    Url: http://www.mobily.com\r\n    Date: 2006-01-26\r\n    Subject: It's a newsletter!\r\n\r\n    Hi,\r\n\r\n    We have published more than 250 articles. Some of them are bound to be disliked by some readers - sorry about that.\r\n\r\n    Please do remember that it was only a simple newsletter. A \"real\" article (published in issue 10) about a Linux distribution is for example:\r\n\r\n    http://www.freesoftwaremagazine.com/free_issues/issue_10/jump_to_debian\r\n\r\n    I hope you'll enjoy our magazine!\r\n\r\n    Merc."
