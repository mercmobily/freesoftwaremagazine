    body: "Your comment\r\n<cite>(I'd probably make better progress if it showed up as blog-sized chunks in my feed reader every day.)</cite>\r\nwould make for a nice RSS-based extension to open content sites like Project Gutenberg.  Take any novel/content and chunk it in a way that it can wholly be downloaded as a sequence of RSS entries.  Offline RSS readers would cache the content allowing for fully disconnected reading.  No need to keep track of bookmarks/places/etc.  Fantastic idea."

Then again, maybe that would be a good way to get through a book that isn''t grabbing my full attention.  (It''s really sad, I know.  I''d like to regain the attention span I once had.)'
