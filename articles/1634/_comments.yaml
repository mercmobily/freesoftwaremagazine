    body: 'I noticed the Opera 9 release too. It sounds like it''s a really nice browser, but like you, I probably won''t be trying it out. I learned a long time ago that time spent learning a proprietary program is time wasted, because you''re just going to have to give it up later anyway (generally because they discontinue the product and it slowly become unusable due to changes in the data -- ''bitrot'').'
