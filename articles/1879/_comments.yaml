    body: "Could it be around the IP technology? I mean, Linux code is *probably* although defintly distinct from Unix's code owned by SCO. Now whilst SCO are attempting to sue IBM and NOVELL, Novel has proven that it held the rights to Unix way before Sco brought it off Bell Labs or whoever. It's also widely acknowledged that MS copied and pasted code for networking from BSD years and years ago. Effectively meaning that SCO and Novell could refute that IP networking code is owned by them alone. Something Microsoft wants them to fight for, since it's pay off to Novell makes it immune to attack - but an enemy of linux is a friend of MS. I'm talking about the actual source code used in all products rather than any patents against the IP Protocol or concept.\r\n\r\nNow at the end of the day, Linux is safe and always will be, because even though MS, SCO and Novell are multi-million dollar companies, Linux is supported by the biggest computer companies in the world. 2 Companies so big that there are on the fotune 500 list near the top. I am of course, talking about IBM and Sun Microsystems. IBM of course, make roughly 5 or 6 times the money microsoft makes every year.\r\n\r\nWith those companies supporting Linux 100% it's easy to see us *little guys* at the bottom have nothing to worry about.\r\n\r\nI hope you all find my \"conspiracy theories\" interesting.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nPhill\r\nprt_faber@hotmail.com"

If you don't like it, don't buy their closed-source products. \r\n\r\nLinux and mono remain free software. Novell hasn't done anything to change that - indeed, nobody can change that. That's the beaty of free software, right?\r\n\r\nI think Novell has done enough for free software to deserve our respect, and we owe them too much of a moral debt to turn on them angrily just because they took MS money. Where's the offense? Promising not to sue MS over Novell patents? The way I see it, Novell got MS to fund free software development in exchange for not suing over software patents, which are evil anyway. That's great! Let's have more deals like that!\r\n\r\nYou may claim that Novell is giving up a valuable legal weapon in case of an MS patent offensive against other linux developers. But surely you'll recognize that:\r\n\r\n1. Novell cannot stop other parties from suing MS over patents should the need arise.\r\n2. Patents are far less effective against a deep-pocketed closed-source company like MS anyway.\r\n\r\nSo, to sum up, there's no significant downside to this deal for the free software people, as far as I can tell.\r\n"
