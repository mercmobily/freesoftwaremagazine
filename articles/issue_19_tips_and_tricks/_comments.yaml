    body: "If you last typed '<em>ls -aFgohs</em>' and now you want to do it again, but without cycling through with PgUp or Ctrl+P, you can type '<em>!ls</em>' and it will automatically add all the arguments for the program ls.\r\n\r\nAlso, if you last used ssh, and want to cycle through ONLY the ssh history in your bash, simply type '<em>ssh</em>' and hit PgUp. This will cycle through ssh commands recently executed, and ignore all other history listings.\r\n\r\nVery handy tools. I'm surprised this article didn't even touch on those! TskTsk\r\n\r\nFelipe"
