I have to admit that I am a sucker for nice screen shots, desktop wallpaper, etc.  I also subscribe to OSDir.com's RSS feeds, and every week (or sooner) they post screen shots from yet another Linux distro that I've never heard of. 

This week, however, they posted a link to [a page of thumbnails](http://shots.osdir.com/index_thumbs.php)s of all different types of distros!
