    body: "I've done that. However, though I don't know a huge amount about file formats, I don't think there's any such thing as the 'OGG family' of codecs. From my understanding, Ogg is only a container format, and the only thing codecs such as Vorbis and Theora (and sometimes FLAC) have in common technically is that they are all used together with it.\r\n\r\n--\r\nGNU - free as in freedom"

    body: "Yikes,\r\n\r\nyes I do know about Dirac :D (thanks to a Linux Format article several months back). It's great that the BBC are doing development work, and that it's open, BUT their mainstream press coverage of the technology world leaves a lot to be desired, certainly when considering the free software point of view. That's not mentioning the fact they only provide their online media in proprietary formats making access difficult (if not impossible) for those license payers who wish to use free software. "
