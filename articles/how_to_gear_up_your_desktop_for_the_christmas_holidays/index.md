I just saw my first Christmas lights a few days ago. Do you know what that means? I’m scrambling on my steep roof and putting up those “wonderful” icicles and decorating our ten foot high trees with lights up to the top. Not to mention those dang candles in the windows (which means putting out the lights on the upstairs windows and closing the shades). But Christmas time isn’t all doom and gloom. It brings a very special time: decorating your GNU/Linux-based PC.


# Wallpapers

I’ll start off with my collection of Christmas wallpapers (all related in some way to GNU/Linux). Here’s a list of my favorite wallpapers:


* [Ubuntu Christmas Wallpaper](http://gnome-look.org/content/show.php/Ubuntu+Christmas+wallpaper?content=50051) created by [kane77](http://kane.sk/).
* [A Tux Christmas](http://www.gnome-look.org/content/show.php/A+Tux+Christmas?content=49467) created by [g33z](http://wallpapers-n-etc.com/).
* [Ubuntu Christmas](http://marcelomendes.eti.br/blog/?p=7) created by [Marcelo Mendes](http://marcelomendes.eti.br/).
* [Happy Holidays With Tux](http://hospitality.tamu.edu/graphics/Happy-Holidays-Tux-thumb_306x245.jpg) created by an anonymous author
* [Wrong Palce at the Wrong Time](http://www.kde-look.org/content/show.php/wrong+place+at+the+wrong+time?content=4503) created by [basse](http://www.lib.hel.fi/~basse).
* [Gnome Christmas (Remake)](http://www.gnome-look.org/content/show.php/GNOME+Christmas+%28Remake%29?content=32739) created by [vendettared](http://www.gnome-look.org/usermanager/search.php?username=vendettared).
* [Ubuntu Christmas (Remake)](http://www.gnome-look.org/content/show.php/Ubuntu+Christmas+%28Remake%29?content=32738) created by [vendettared](http://www.gnome-look.org/usermanager/search.php?username=vendettared).
* [KDE & Tux Christmas](http://img207.imageshack.us/img207/7417/kdexmastux1024dj8.jpg) created by [LinuxHouse.tk](http://linuxhouse.altervista.org/).
* [Santa Tux](http://kde-look.org/content/show.php/Santa-Tux?content=32895)

You can get all of these in one ZIP from [DivShare](http://www.divshare.com/download/2689779-422). Download them, put them in a folder (like `/usr/share/wallpapers`), and make Gnome or KDE set to rotate between them every minute.


# Theming

While you’re customizing your look, you’ll want to add a nice theme. If you use Beryl, grab the [Christmas Beryl 3D Desktop Cube Theme](http://www.gnome-look.org/content/show.php/Christmas+Beryl+3D+Desktop+Cube+Theme?content=49918) by [tuxramone](http://goberylgo.blogspot.com/). GTK users will enjoy the [Christmas Theme](http://www.gnome-look.org/content/show.php/Christmas+Theme+%28blue+%26+green%29?content=49614) in blue and green by [TheeMahn](http://www.gnome-look.org/usermanager/search.php?username=TheeMahn). If you use Gnome, you’ll also want the [Ubuntu Christmas Login](http://www.gnome-look.org/content/show.php/Ubuntu+Christmas+Login?content=49530) theme by [thecellodude](http://www.gnome-look.org/usermanager/search.php?username=thecellodude). KDE users on the other hand should install the [Tux-Christmas](http://kde-look.org/content/show.php/Tux-Christmas?content=19098) splash screen by [TheOneAndOnlyFoo](http://www.neues-weltbild.de.ms/). Finally, Firefox users will want to try out the [Tinseltown](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/3918) by [Thomas McMahon (aka TwisterMc)](http://www.twistermc.com/). Lastly, if you’re dual booting and using GRUB, create a splash screen using [QGRUBEditor](http://www.qt-apps.org/content/show.php/QGRUBEditor?content=60391) (by [artemisfowl2007](http://www.qt-apps.org/usermanager/search.php?username=artemisfowl2007)) and one of the wallpapers in the previous section.

# Xsnow

Lastly, a little program for those who like widgets and such. [Xsnow](http://www.euronet.nl/~rja/Xsnow/) (created by [Rick Jansen](http://www.euronet.nl/~rja/) is a _really_ old program for GNU/Linux that sends snow flakes, wind, and sometimes Santa’s sleigh across your desktop (see figure 1). If you use KDE, you need to make sure programs can run in the desktop window (KControl>Desktop>Behavior and check Allow programs in desktop window).
