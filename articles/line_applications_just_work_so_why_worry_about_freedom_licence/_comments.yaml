    body: "Hi Ryan,\r\n\r\nNice, thoughtful article. You have raised an issue which should concern us all. In our gaderine haste to use the latest online web application that replaces desktop software we often forget that freedom still matters. We shouldn't ignore the matter of the licence just because the software resides on a remote server.\r\n\r\nAs irony would have it, I had just finished reading your article when I came across an interview Richard Stallman gave to the Guardian newspaper on Monday, 29th September about the dangers of cloud computing. He described it as \"stupidity. It's worse than stupidity: it's a marketing hype campaign\". Larry Ellison at Oracle described it as \"fashion driven\" and complete gibberish\". \r\n\r\nBoth are concerned not just about licences but about putting security and privacy. Both men smell a proprietarial rat. They may be right."
