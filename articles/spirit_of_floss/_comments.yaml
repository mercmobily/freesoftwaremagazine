Interestingly enough, I've begun re-evaluating today exactly what Freedom is to me, after posing the question to several people on several Free Software related lists.\r\n\r\nFrankly, I was quite surprised. I've long held that patent encumbered formats are not Free Software, but there are people who insist that formats can't be non-Free.\r\n\r\nI think this highlights EXACTLY what Jabari is saying. Some people view Free Software as a means of being unrestricted by certain things, the \"Free From\" he referred to. However, when true freedom is the objective, it reaches beyond software into culture itself. Just because an application has some condition (say, GPL License) doesn't means it's Free, though it MAY be Free Software, even in the \"Free Speech\" sense.\r\n\r\nThough I don't agree entirely with the statement, I now understand what Jabarai was saying earlier about the use of slaves. I think too many people, including myself, got caught up in the racial undertone, or the social mores around discussing it. What he says, quite simply, is that \"In a group of people, motivated by the ideals of Freedom, the use of a 'slave' analogy is inconsistant.\" We'll refuse certain technology outright because of the lack of freedom and the implied societal impact of that, but we casually and unthinkingly describe processes in terms of subjugation, restriction and control.\r\n\r\n"

If an application is licensed under the GPL then it is by definition Free Software. What other definition of Free do you want to apply to software? Must it also be 'Free' of offensive metaphors? Who is going to decide which metaphors are offensive? \r\n\r\nThe current definition of Free Software is narrow and objective enough to allow a broad spectrum of support. If you want to expand the definition to encompass broader and less clearly defined ideas you risk watering down the core concept of the movement.\r\n\r\nWhich is not to say there aren't other things that we need to address as a society. Just that the Free Software movement does a good job of addressing Freedom as it relates to software. Lets not cripple it by forcing it to address Freedom in all it's possible definitions.\r\n\r\nRMS sets a good example here. His political activities cover the spectrum of progressive causes, but he knows better than to fight for all of them simultaneously in the same forum."

You may distribute software to everyone except people named Balthazaar. 99.99% of the world is free to accept and distribute that, but it still isn't totally free, and hence, isn't Free.\r\n\r\nThe Free Software movement always pushes the ethics of freedom and software, otherwise, it's merely Open Source. Why then, is it acceptable to use something that has somewhat shady Freedom status, even though it TECHNICALLY is Free Software? That's the point; people are too often focused with the technicalities, and seldom forget the core idea, Freedom.\r\n\r\nWhat's the point of working for Free Software if not to work towards freedom in general? If we agree that working towards freedom is a good thing, we should evaluate the way we use terms that conjure subjugation.\r\n\r\n<em>Must it also be 'Free' of offensive metaphors? Who is going to decide which metaphors are offensive?</em>\r\n\r\nYes and no. To me, the questionable aspect of the use of \"slave\" in Free Software is that \"Slave\" doesn't fit with \"Free\". I'm not offended by the use of the term \"slave\", but some people might be. I don't think the reason to remove it is because it's \"offensive\" but becuase it's not in line with the idea of Freedom. And again, that's still kinda nit-picky. For me, it's more an exercise in self-evaluation.\r\n\r\nRichard Stallman objects to the use of the term \"patent protection\", even though TECHNICALLY the law provides certain \"protections\" in regard to patents. We use Digital Rights Mutilation (or Digital Restriction management) to very clearly express the ideas behind what we stand for. Shouldn't then, we eliminate other terms that aren't Freedom oriented?"

A restriction, even affecting few people, makes it non-Free.\r\n\r\n<em>What are you talking about? What is technically Free Software, but with 'shady Freedom status'?</em>\r\n\r\nPatent restricted formats. MP3 for instance. It is possible to create, edit and listen to an MP3 file using ONLY Free Software. However, because of the patent issues looming, I'd argue that that format has shady Freedom status.\r\n\r\n\"Free Software\" is a matter of licenses. \"Freedom in Software\" is a matter of practical application. The GPL actually stipulates to geographic restrictions. It provides for limits to where someone can distribute Free Software. I expressed my opinion on the GPL v3 draft that this is actually a LIMITATION on Freedom.\r\n\r\nMy arguement comes down to \"Software licenses are merely a single portion of Freedom.\" People who identify with \"Free Software\" do so often claiming that Freedom is important. However, the same people seldom look behind the license to determine if the software they're using ACTUALLY protects their freedoms."

    body: "<em>Applying restrictions that the USA has on the rest of the world is freedom ?</em>\r\n\r\nFreedom is universal. If one person is limited from utilizing software, it's not truly Free.\r\n\r\n\r\n<em>Having the freedom to take someone else's freedom away is not a freedom worth fighting for.</em>\r\n\r\nI totally agree with this one. My point was that some people use the GPL to define \"Freedom\" but those who use ONLY the GPL as a guide are idiots. The GPL v2 is being revised because the v2 didn't cover all of the threats to Free Software. And in twenty years, when new threats present themselves, the v3 won't be able to deal with them.\r\n\r\nThe members of the Free Software community need to evaluate what Freedom is. There are threats to Freedom not addressed in software licenses, the Free Software movement should still feel affronted by these things.\r\n\r\n<em>If you don't like the freedoms given to you by the GPL ... you can always invent your own movement, your own license and your own ethic rules.</em>\r\n\r\nFirst, this was addressed to me personally; you're mistaken about the Freedoms I value. The GNU GPL is my prefered license in development and in use on my own systems. I find some of the other \"Free Software\" licenses unacceptable because they DON'T address important issues. When GPLv3 is released, I'll adopt THAT as my primary license, because I feel it is MORE protective than GPLv2. They're both Free Software licenses, but v3 does more to protect Freedom. In time, I will come to find GPLv2 inadequate. But the point is, I do very much value the Freedoms in the GPL.\r\n\r\nSecondly, I already do have my own set of ethical rules, you say that as if it's a bad thing. If the Free Software Foundation did something that was against my code of ethics, I'd quickly reject it. The thing about the FSF and the Free Software community is that it fits PERFECTLY with my ideas on ethics.\r\n"

I think there are some cases where there is no Free alternative to do some things without violating patents. In that case, I don't advocate rejecting it. But I also think that a \"Freedom First\" stance should be something used by anyone who cares about Freedom. The MP3 format might be Free Software, but there are other audio formatting options that are \"more free\". Sure, listen to you MP3's if you'v got them. But when you post audio clips on your website, use a format that was designed for Freedom. Is it anymore unreasonable for a Windows user to install the Ogg codecs than it is for a GNU user to install a Flash plugin? So why not take that extra time to show \"Freedom comes first\" ?\r\n\r\n<em>If a single country decides to allow patents on something basic to a GNU/Linux system, should we all give up GNU/Linux in protest? The GPL allows for this, by letting everyone else in the world continue to use the Free Software, and putting the citizens of the countries that allow for this abuse of patents at a disadvantage.</em>\r\n\r\nI wouldn't urge people to abandon anything, but I do urge people to think. Say, for instance, the US passed a law making kernels started by people named \"Linus\" unlawful. I would protest that law as much as possible, writing government officials weekly. But I might switch to BSD, or OpenSolaris. There are other Free operating systems. Should, however, it ban ALL Free operating systems, I'd then break the law. If there's a Free option, take it. \r\n\r\nAs to the second part, about \"putting the citizens of that counrty\" at a disadvantage... I understand the IDEA, but am botherd by the carry through. That idea is based on the ideal of a democracy. It makes the assumption \"If a nation has software patents, the people wanted them.\" The problem with that is that the people DON'T allow it. In the US, the people have little to no say on the laws that are actually passed. So it is quite possible for a law to pass that the entire non-government populace disagrees with, and to STAY a law. I think penalizing people because of the actions of their government is contrary to Freedom, and contrary to Free Software ideals.\r\n\r\n<em>think it would be really difficult for Free Software writers to distribute their code if they had to ensure that it wasn't covered by any patents anywhere in the world</em>\r\n\r\nI agree, and that is a very real issue. That's why I think it's really up to the end user to decide if they consider the patent threat to be infringement upon their freedom. This concept means that a license can't possibly address ALL facets of Freedom in Software."

    body: "\"The Free software movement is philosophically a social movement, not a technical one.\"\r\n\r\nWrong. When you're examining what GNU considers to be \"free software\" it states four basic freedoms:\r\n* The freedom to run the program, for any purpose (freedom 0).\r\n* The freedom to study how the program works, and adapt it to your needs (freedom 1).\r\n* The freedom to redistribute copies (freedom 2).\r\n* The freedom to improve the program, and release your improvements to the public (freedom 3).\r\n\r\nWhat you are constantly trying is to subvert FOSS to accommodate and facilitate your own political agenda. IHMO FOSS is simply a practical, pragmatic philosophy of peer programmers. For your information (because I  doubt very much that you have ANY philosophical background) \"pragmatic\" means:\r\n* don't try to answer questions that cannot be answered;\r\n* don't pursue any research on matters that have no significant application.\r\n\r\nI find more and more that you have what Nietzsche calls \"a slave morality\", since slave morality begins in those people who are weak, uncertain of themselves, oppressed and abused. Your definition of freedom is the freedom of slaves. Well, I don't consider all those talented people who work on FOSS software to be slaves. On the contrary, it is a group of talented, strong willed men who took destiny into their own hands and consequently changed the world. It is not by accident they reference \"world domination\" more than once! Master morality begins in the 'noble man' with a spontaneous idea of the 'good', then the idea of 'bad' develops in opposition to it. In that view \"freedom\" takes a very different meaning from the one that you have: \"freedom\" does not equal \"liberation\", on the contrary. Because man's actions and choices are his and his alone, he is condemned to be responsible for his free choices (Satre).\r\n\r\nYour petty view on \"freedom\" is utterly dangerous to FOSS as a whole. If programmers are condemned to view their every single move in the view of how it could be useful to others, we are bound to become just like the paycheck slaves that follow the same principles - how can it be sold. \"Freedom\" allows us to learn, share and exchange knowledge and experiment - without being bound by the idea of how it can be utile to other, less privileged and talented people. It's not that I'm against it - it is just a side effect, not a primary or even secundary goal. It is there that I value FOSS, there lies my freedom. Anything else is for politicians - not programmers.\r\n"
