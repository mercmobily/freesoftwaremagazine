  Draft 3 of [GPLv3](http://fsfeurope.org/projects/gplv3/)  should be  out [Real  Soon Now](http://news.com.com/GPL+3+release+could+slip+past+March/2100-7344_3-6158453.html), so I'd like to review some of the topics.  I couldn't  find a thorough explanation of how GPLv3 will deal with the  "anti-circumvention" clauses of the DMCA and it's EU  counterpart,  the [the  EUCD (see Article 6)](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32001L0029:EN:HTML), so here's my layperson understanding.

  These laws harm society in a number of ways.  Some general  information can be found  on [FSFE's EUCD  page](http://fsfeurope.org/projects/eucd/) but here I just want to look at how these laws could cause  problems  for [free  software](http://fsfeurope.org/documents/freesoftware) developers and distributors, and what free software  licences can do about them.

  I see two potential problems:


1.   A copyright holder could publish a work and authorise one free  software application to access that work, and if a software  developer wrote another application to access that same work, the  copyright holder could accuse the second developer of copyright  infringement for using an unauthorised piece of software to access  the copyrighted work.
1.   A copyright holder could publish a work and publish a free software  program that is authorised for accessing that work, but if a  software developer modified that free software program, the  copyright holder could accuse that software developer of copyright  infringement for using software other than the single authorised  version.

  I hope both cases would be thrown out of court by any judge, but  there's no reasons to leave it to chance or to leave such  uncertainty there.

  Section 3 of Draft 2 of GPLv3 contains this wording:


>  3. No Denying Users' Rights through Technical Measures.. 


>  Regardless of any other provision of this License, no permission is  given for modes of conveying that deny users that run covered works  the full exercise of the legal rights granted by this License.. 


>  No covered work constitutes part of an effective technological  "protection" measure under section 1201 of Title 17 of the United  States Code.  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal  power to forbid circumvention of technical measures that include use  of the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit  operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing the  legal rights of third parties against the work's users.. 

  The meat is in the last paragraph.  Sentences one and two seem to  address problems one and two, respectively, that I described above.

  Some people have wondered if this will work.  Some say this is like  declaring "this leaf is not cannabis" - but the situations  are not analogous.  That cannabis leaves are what they are is a fact  of nature, but whether or not a software mechanism is an  anti-circumvention system, that depends on the intent of the person  who created the mechanism.  Eben  Molgen [answered  this last June](http://fsfeurope.org/projects/gplv3/barcelona-moglen-transcript.en.html#q3-dmca-wordings):


>  I expect that US courts will be instructed on the intention of the  licensor to reject the features of DMCA as it applies to GPL  software. I expect the United States courts to listen closely to  statements of the licensor's intent, because under US copyright law  it is the licensor's intent which normatively determines the content  of licence.. 

  In the typically cuatious words of a lawyer, I guess he's saying  that he can't predict the future but it looks like it should work.

  Another document with information about this the "Opinion on  DRM" which was published along with draft 2 of GPLv3:


* [http://gplv3.fsf.org/drm-dd2.html](http://gplv3.fsf.org/drm-dd2.html)

  The rise of free software is accompanied by a rise in the incentives  for opponents to find loopholes and ways to exploit our licences.  The extra clarifications like these are being added to the licence  to protect the right of everyone to modify the software and  distribute modified versions.  These clarifications make the licence  longer, but I think they reduce complexity at the same time because  if GPLv3 said nothing about certain issues, then users of the GPL  would have to additionally investigate the status of a program that  has no explicit statement about that issue.

  A complete solution to the EUCD/DMCA involves getting laws changed,  and that means either getting involved in lobbying  or [supporting  lobby groups](http://ciaran.compsoc.com/fsfe-fellowship.html) which are representing positions you agree with.  Like [software  patents](http://fsfeurope.org/projects/swpat/), GPLv3 can't make the whole of this problem go away, but  it can protect us in some situations, so now is the time to think of  when and how GPLv3 can protect us in these and similar situations.
