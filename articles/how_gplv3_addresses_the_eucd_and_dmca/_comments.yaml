    body: "The FSF has in fact gone to considerable effort to make sure that the GPL satisfies not only US laws, but those from many other jurisdictions. If you check the rationale you'll see that your criticism is unfounded:\r\n\r\nhttp://gplv3.fsf.org/gpl-rationale-2006-01-16.html\r\n\r\nIANAL either, so I can't comment on the particular sentence you quote. However, from what I've read and heard from Eben Moglen, I am confident that the legal team working on the GPL is very much aware of non-US legal systems, and they are making every effort to internationalize the license.\r\n\r\nTyler"
