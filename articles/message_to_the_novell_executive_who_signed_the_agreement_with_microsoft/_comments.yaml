Manager X spent time telling people how much money he personally made off the Ximian sale to Novell.  While this was a hackers conference, he offered a slick marketing presentation on Ximian and the Sun Java Desktop and why every GNOME hacker should care first about how to make Ximian more successful, for that (and his personal fortunes) he told us was the definition of the success of GNOME as a project.  Otherwise he showed contempt for everyone involved for the rest of the conference, including GNOME hackers, the sponsoring organization, and especially for Mr. Stallman, who also attended that particular GNOME developer's conference.\r\n\r\n"

Novell's reaction was to buy DRI in order to be able to supply DR-DOS 6 as the client OS when MS DOS blocked Netware.\r\n\r\nMS and Novell then made an agreement that Novell would not actively market DR-DOS and would not include bundled DR-DOS licences with Netware and MS would continue to supply Netware clients with MS-DOS. Effectively this killed DR-DOS and NW-DOS, and all the other DRI products.\r\n\r\nMS then released a version of Advanced Server that would do connection sharing so that 100 users could access a 25 user Netware licence via shared connections. Potentially this reduced Novell's revenue by 75%.\r\n\r\nYou'd think Novell has learnt.\r\n"

The Dreamcast would run on Windows CE and Microsoft would help it to be successful.\r\n\r\nThe Dreamcast came out too early and it bombed.  Sega pulled completely out of the console market, relegating themselves to just being a game publisher.  Then along came the X-Box.\r\n\r\nDo you have an old Dreamcast laying around?  I do.  If you do too, take a look at the controller.  What do you see.  That's right, it looks almost exactly like the X-Box controller, right down to the button configuration and button color scheme.  And of course, the X-Box also runs on Windows.\r\n\r\nSo, Microsoft partnered with Sega and learned all of their console gaming technology, using the Dreamcast both as something to learn from and as something to test their theories on, and then they helped Sega bring it to market too early so it would fail.  When it inevitably did, they took everything they learned and made their own console system."
