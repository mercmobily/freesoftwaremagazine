    body: "Good article and I see your point. I assume you mean \"The year of Desktop Linux\" which is what I heard so much about last year (and the year before and the one before etc.).\r\n\r\nHowever the major difference between the examples that you give (Egypt/Rome/IBM) and GNU/Linux or free software is that your examples were all run by a central control of some sort (empires, businesses etc.) . Also they existed with a view to expanding themselves. GNU/Linux and the Free software used on it - by nature -  tends to be community led and tends to exist to meet the needs of it's own community and the surrounding ones. It grows not by force (either armed or commercial) but by service to the same communities. It has no  central ego to satisfy. The features that turn up usually are developed to meet user (often developer/user) needs and not sales targets/growth plans.\r\n\r\nSo while there may be individual companines whose business depends more on the growth of GNU/Linux, they exist within a larger community which will continue even if they do not.\r\n\r\nIt's intersting that these predictions of world domination are regularly made by those outside the user community. They tend (IME) to be made by journalists who are interested in selling copy and by \"analysts\" who earn their living saying such things.\r\n\r\nDo I think Free software (not necessarily GNU/Linux but it does seem the likliest candidate) will have it's day? - Yes I do but I think it will kind of sneak up on us instead of it being some recognisable year of growth. One day we'll be writing articles that try to pinpoint exactly when it was that we all started to use Free software instead of proprietary lock-ins.\r\n\r\nCheers\r\nRyan"

    body: "Free licenses are to software development what sex was to evolution.\r\n\r\nThey greatly increase the rate of innovation, because they permit constant and promiscuous recombinant experimentation.  The Cambrian Explosion on Earth came shortly after microbes began to be able to exchange DNA and thus freely share their innovations with their neighbors.\r\n\r\nThe truth is that Linux will die.  FreeBSD will die.  Even the Posix standard will die.  But they will have progeny that will live on.\r\n\r\nProprietary programs are inherently sterile, like a neutered cat. When they die, you just have to buy or adopt a new one. They may be good at catching mice, but they won't teach their children how to, because they're not going to have any children.\r\n\r\nThis is one of many ways in which you can see that the free software world is one of organic, constantly evolving change, as opposed to the artificial \"engineered\" world of proprietary software. If you want a quick, efficient way to get a particular job done, and you can afford to throw a lot of money at the problem, the engineered solution is likely the best. But in the long run, it loses, because it's brittle and unchangeable. It can't adapt.\r\n\r\n"
