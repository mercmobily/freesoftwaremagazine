    body: "Gary, nicely summed up and explained!\r\n\r\n\"The thing that intrigues me is what exactly the BBC said and or did to cause Paul(sic) to feel constrained to close up shop.\"\r\n\r\nApart from the BBC's disrespect for the spirit of FOSS which you so accurately described above, it was more about their actions and the fact that they said nothing other than deliberately blocking 'unauthorised clients' of which most out there were open source - and they knew that. After all, the BBC had *many* internal get_iplayer users over the years.\r\n\r\nBy implementing SWF verification, which is in the BBC's mind 'content protection', they might have been forcing me to break the law (EUCD / Copyright and Related Rights Act 2003) if I were to make it work again with Adobe SWF RTMP streams (i.e. if I circumvented SWF verification) or even assisted others in doing so (IANAL, but I could see this being their argument however unfounded it is). Hence the taking down of the project and web site. They could have tried to get me on the anti-circumvention clause(s) and I simply don't have the financial resources to legally fight the BBC. I maintain that this was a deliberate move on the part of the BBC. The website was just getting lots of posts full of people trying to tell other user's how to circumvent the 'content protection' - It wasn't really fair for me to take the risk of hosting such a forum especially since it was a moderated one.\r\n\r\nBTW: My name is Phil Lewis\r\n"

    body: "The BBC is full of people who have worked all over the media industry. Just like all industries. In the IT world we meet people at new employers who we might have worked with in the past, or who have worked for an arch-rival in the past. The same goes for the world of TV. Don't they get called luvvies?\r\n\r\nSo the people at the BBC who have worked elsewhere in the media world are most likely to have worked for commercial entities (eg BSkyB, ITV, BBC production contractors). The pre-occupation with DRM, restrictions, and control almost make sense for a commercial company's product[1], but not so for the BBC, who is a public service broadcaster. But the people will have very much the commercial philosophy rolling around in them, because they will have been rewarded in the past with pay and promotion at commercial entities by exercising the commercial philosophy. They repeat this at the BBC, and it ultimately changes the BBC's philosophy. The people don't need to understand, or even recognise the philosophies, it is the exercise of it that matters.\r\n\r\nThere are probably also people in the BBC whose chances of pay rises and bonuses are directly proportional to the income raised by BBC content sales on DVD, sales to the likes of GOLD, Dave, etc., and the BBC's commercial arm in the US. These people will object, by default, to any thing that relinquishes control of a bit of media.\r\n\r\n[1] I personally will not pay for any products that contain technological anti-features, and avoid them if possible, unless there is no alternative (and then I will not waste much time with the things). So I will not buy DVDs any more, as they contain CSS, as ineffectual as it is. The region code system is also offensive - the manufacturers can benefit from globalisation, but the end users can't. I will not buy a TV that has HDMI, as that supports DRM (in fact, you can't call a HDMI interface HDMI unless it implements HDCP - High Def Copy Protection, and a royalty has been paid to the IP owners). I will not pay for proprietary software, and I will not use it unless there is no other choice. And some stuff that has no alternative (like Flash) I just do without. The web is very quiet without Flash.\r\n\r\nThe above philosophy has lead to some hard purchase decisions, but ultimately it has freed me from a lot of consumerism."
