    body: "While I agree that self-hosting is more possible than it used to be, it can be a problem. What may seem like enormously high bandwidth for browsing, may still be kind of  tight for a server.  Furthermore, servers require high \"up and down\" speeds, whereas much broadband service is \"asymmetric\", meaning you get a lot slower upload than download.\r\n\r\nFor example, it's not uncommon to see \"384 kbps down / 128 kbps up\" or \"1024 kbps down / 128 kbps up\".  For a server, that \"up\" figure is the limiting factor (e.g. HTML requests (down) are usually tiny, but webpages (up) are large).\r\n\r\nThere's also reliability. Data centers usually have better uptime than you can manage at home.\r\n\r\nBut even if you have the bandwidth, you still have the headaches associated with running security on your website.  Even if I did run my server at my house, I'd surely want it to be a separate machine, so that it wouldn't interfere with my desktop use -- I prefer to run a good firewall so I can be a little relaxed about the security updates on my desktop machine. Almost all attacks on Linux security are server-attacks -- if you only use the machine as a client (and block other traffic), the odds of an intrusion are really tiny (I've never had this happen, after 6 years of using Linux on the desktop).\r\n\r\nOf course, this all depends on what you want a website to do. If it's just your home page, then a direct site makes sense.  If it's any kind of business or organization, though, the cost of a data-center-based webhost is probably worth it (and for me, anyway, it costs less than my ISP does, so it's not a big expense).\r\n"
