    body: "It's good to have clarifications like this posted every so often.\r\n\r\nI usually describe myself as a pragmatist, too, which is why I approve more of what some people call the \"open source movement\", though I view it purely as a marketing campaign, since as far as I am concerned there is no material difference between \"open source software\" and \"free software\" (All software must be \"free-licensed\" to be considered \"open source\" by OSI and other \"open source\" authorities and all software must have \"open source\" to be considered \"free software\" -- hence each is a subset of the other, which according to formal logic, means they are the same set. QED! Everything else is hype and politics*).\r\n\r\nBut I personally feel it is more constructive to argue the practical aspects of open source.  For one thing, most of the \"moral\" or \"ethical\" aspects of free-licensing only make sense once you understand the <em>consequences</em> of the actions you take. It's only in that pragmatic context that the ethical arguments make any sense.\r\n\r\nI think people who obsess on what they call \"moral\" arguments for free software are very sheltered people who just don't realize that their arguments are meaningless within (or openly hostile to) the moral worldview of a large part of the world. I spend a lot of time trying to explain my belief systems to people who <em>don't</em> share my fundamental worldview, so I have to learn to speak other peoples' \"moral languages\", as it were.  Sometimes that means you have to do \"fourier transforms\" in your head, as it were, to get from one worldview to the other, which can definitely be hard work, but it's rewarding when people do finally start to see the light.\r\n\r\nI figure that once people try out free software, they'll begin to see the ethical dimension as a natural consequence of experiencing the pragmatics.\r\n\r\nBut you have to argue the pragmatic side, or you get resistance. If people think that the people who write free software get nothing for their work, then that makes them suspicious and cynical (or else they feel like they are exploiting someone -- which suggests that free software is unethical). They think they're being offered something that is \"too good to be true\".\r\n\r\nThat's why it's so important to show what programmers' motivations are for creating free software (I'd enumerate, but I have a blog about that in the queue for later this month, so I guess I'll refrain).\r\n\r\nAnyway, one thing I think I should say is that just because somebody primarily likes to describe things in pragmatic terms (because they believe those have the most persuasive power) doesn't mean they don't appreciate the ethical argument. In fact many such people regard <em>all</em> ethics as ultimately stemming from some kind of pragmatic argument (e.g. the evolutionary view of altruism). That's a worldview in itself, of course.\r\n\r\nOh yeah, and I've used Photoshop and GIMP both. Guess which one I prefer? Gimp ... everytime. One the things I hate about Photoshop is that the filters almost never have any options -- whereas Gimp filters tend to be extremely programmable and flexible.  I do wish somebody would go ahead and add the CMYK support to GIMP, as it is an unfortunate oversight, but honestly, I don't find it sufficient to promote Photoshop as an \"irreplaceable\" proprietary app. I don't think I've found anything visual that I could imagine that I could accomplish with Gimp, Inkscape, and/or Blender (there are a many things I still don't know how to do, but I know they can be done).\r\n\r\nCAD may be a fair cop.  However, I'm getting interested in BRL-CAD, I'm starting to think it's stronger than I gave it credit for.\r\n\r\n\r\n*I've glossed over the one pragmatic difference: OSI approves \"talk back\" licenses which require the original author to be informed of changes. While I disapprove of their choice on this tiny point, it is hardly a matter for civil war. The distinction is over the implementation of copyleft, which both sides regard as important to the maintenance of freedom. So you see, even the only material difference is about an \"ethical\" issue -- the maintenance of freedom. Or is that pragmatic? That's why I argue that the whole disagreement is \"specious and fractious\" -- \"open source\" and \"free\" are both contractions of \"free-licensed open source\" which is what both parties actually mean.\r\n"

    body: "I think that the ethics behind Free software are very important - they're what won me over originally, and I'm sure that RMS would say they trump all other concerns - but they don't hold much sway with business.  Showing a company owner how the issue affects his bottom line is much more likely to gain his support than telling him that it's the right thing to do.\r\n\r\nI prefer The Gimp, too, but my friends in the graphic design industry recoil in horror at it.  I don't completely understand their reasoning (the biggest \"problem\" seems to be that The Gimp doesn't look exactly like PS), but it's pretty important to them that they have access to the software they've trained on for the last fifteen years.  You might also have a look a Krita.  It's still under heavy development, but it's recently hit the point that it's nearly as stable as The Gimp, and I prefer its interface by a wide margin.  Oh, and it does CMYK."

    body: "That's encouraging. Thanks for the link!\r\n\r\nI don't actually <em>use</em> CMYK myself, it just seems to be the main tangible complaint of Photoshop users about Gimp, so I just want it in to shut them up!  ;-)\r\n\r\nSeriously, I'm glad to know there is a plugin for it. From the description, it sounds like it's still a bit immature, though.\r\n\r\nI personally haven't found anything lacking in Gimp, and I use it quite often. I'm more of a vector-art user, though, so I use Skencil and Inkscape even more.\r\n"
