    body: "<cite>Ignoring the real advantages of centrally-hosted software is a head-in-the-sand approach and wonâ€™t work. Instead we need to figure out how to get those advantages while preserving freedom.</cite>\r\n\r\nI think that's a very interesting and pressing issue.\r\n\r\nFirst solution: Everybody's got his own server running 24/7 at home. Unfortunately, that's very expensive at the moment. \r\n\r\nSecond solution: Everybody holds all his data on his mobile phone. Unfortunately, this is technically not possible yet, but may come sooner than you expect.\r\n\r\nThe common third solution is relying on a company like Google which holds your data. Obviously you loose a substaintial amount of control here. But what would a company need to do to try to secure our freedoms anyway? If I think about it, these four points strike me first:\r\n\r\n<li>The servers should use free software.</li>\r\n<li>The customer should always be able to download all his data in a useful and free format, in order to prevent vendor lock-in.</li>\r\n<li>All the content published by the users of the service (like Blogs, flickr photos, etc) should be made availlable under a free license (or it should at least be an option)</li>\r\n<li>And probably the most important but most difficult to achieve point: Private data must really be private. Neither the government, nor some cracker, nor any employee of the hosting company should be able to access my data.</li>\r\n\r\nWe get into the weird situation where the server needs to run a software which prevents it's owners (i.e. the company) to access the data it holds. Only the processing software on the server, and the client machine should be able to decrypt the data. Every online service company operating with consumer data should come under pressure to prove us that they can't read our data that they are hosting. The only way to ensure this is that they are only running free software. Then, the source code can be examined and the public can decide how trustworthy the software is. But how do we know they are actually running the software they say they do? \r\n\r\nAnd however secure the software is, the data could theoretically still be read out of the RAM of the server. The only way to be entirely sure is to heavily encrypt your data before sending it to the hosting server. Then, the server can't process it any further, so it's reduced to a simple file server. But with some neat client applications, this might be an approach which proves as a viable path of the middle.\r\n\r\nI wonder what the future holds ready for us... and hope that those 800GB mobile phones (running Linux) with on-the-fly encryption and finger-print scanners soon arrive. ;-)"
