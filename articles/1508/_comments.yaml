They already use other people's computers to browse anonymously or through other illegal means; they don't have to worry about breaking the law and thus they already have great ways of getting around surveliance.  Tor is needed by the people who value privacy and don't want to break the law, if you don't mind breaking the law there are a lot of other options for anonymous browsing.  Thanks for the great article Robin!\r\n-Lokon\r\n<a href=\"http://steelandink.net/blog\">steelandink.net/blog</a>"

    body: "The biggest problem I've had is that running the server slows my old computer down too much. I wish I could run it (and help everyone out) when doing other things, but new computer first. Second biggest problem is google coming up in foreign languages (thanks google)(found that google.com/ncr solves this).\r\nFAQ page is exhaustive, can't imagine any known problems are not solved there. I'm surprised previous poster found it didn't work and could not make it work, as it seems friendly and simple to me."
