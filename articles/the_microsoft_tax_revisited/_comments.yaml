That's good stuff.  \r\n\r\nAs to Anon who wrote 'installing operating systems isn't hard anymore nowadays... except for microsoft windows and all hardware drivers' -- tell me with a straight face that installing Windows XP is harder than installing Debian or Arch or Gentoo or FreeBSD - and the list goes on and on and on."
