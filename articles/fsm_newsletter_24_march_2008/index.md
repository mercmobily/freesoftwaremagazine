2. **OpenOffice.org 3.0's new features, an early look** --OpenOffice.org 3.0 is 167 days away, but who's counting? Maybe the software developers are counting because they have a whopping 2,278 issues targeted for this release.

4. **Microsoft ‘tax’ on Linux in schools must end says Becta** --Becta has recently shown that it is unafraid of speaking out on behalf of schools. Unhappy with the value for money schools were getting regarding software licencing they first referred Microsoft to the government’s Office of Fair Trading then sent shock waves through schools when it issued its advice not to upgrade to Windows Vista or Office 2007.

5. **Windows Vista Incapable** --"Microsoft Windows Vista Service Pack 1 (SP1) is shipping and what we know so far is that it is incapable of running on many types of machines. In fact, Microsoft is being sued for putting stickers all over machines claiming that Vista could run on them, when in fact, it cannot.

6. **Firefox 3 goes on a diet, eats less memory than IE and Opera** --Firefox 3 goes on a diet, eats less memory than IE and Opera [Read more...](http://www.fsdaily.com/EndUser/Firefox_3_goes_on_a_diet_eats_less_memory_than_IE_and_Opera)

9. **Boycott Novell Support Bruce Perens' Fight Against "Invasion of the Borgs"** --Several months ago we wrote very extensively about Microsoft’s motives in joining the OSI. By following the links, you can locate old posts that obviate the need to repeat old arguments.

10. **Has Microsoft Disavowed Vista?** --Technically, Vista is pure misery. It eats system resources like an elephant does peanuts, Windows applications break and its so-called improved security is a joke. I know it. You know it. Even Microsoft's most devoted yes-men know it--although they won't admit it--and perhaps Microsoft knows it as well. [Read more...](http://www.fsdaily.com/Community/Has_Microsoft_Disavowed_Vista)
