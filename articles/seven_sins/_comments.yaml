    body: 'Much redundant or complex code could have been avoided in the first place with some training. For one, familiarity with the available libraries can preempt re-inventing the wheel. Programmers are also bound to pick up good habits from one language, which can be bad habits in another.'

I commented many improvements in our meetings that nobody would heard seriously, maybe because I''m the younger (21) and so on. Actually they''re "discovering" these tricks that most of times I said in the meeting. Personally I don''t think all my proposals are better but at least they could take consideration on them... Envy, Pride or the whole sins?'
