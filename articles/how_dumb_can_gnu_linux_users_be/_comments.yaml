You wrote:\r\n\r\n<cite>We should be willing to expend as much effort learning to use it as we did to learn reading and writing, so that we'll have the necessary base to get the most benefit possible.</cite>\r\n\r\nBut a craftsman doesn't have to be able to write an essay with the same quality as an author or a teacher has to. The craftsman should have other, more practical skills than to express his thoughts in perfect words and write them down correctly. Although it would be nice if he could do that too, he can do other things better - that's why he's a craftsman. And that's why people that aren't skilled in crafts do other things (like writing).\r\n\r\nIn the same way an author shouldn't have to worry about his computer in the same degree as a programmer does. Probably, the author is better in writing books than he's in programming computer code. So why should he be forced to invest a lot of time in learning how to use his typewriter? Of course, it would be nice if he knew how exactly his typewriter worked. Then, he could repair it himself or enhance it if he got a new idea to integrate into the design. But it shouldn't be necesarry for him to figure that out. The programmer is probably better in those things.\r\n\r\nWhat I want to say is just that in a specialized society, not everyone has to be able to hunt his dinner nor should he be forced to know how to repair his car or his computer. Sure, if he wants to know, he should be able to find out (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_wants_to_be_free\">information wants to be free</a>). But if he sinply doesn't care, he still should be able to use the technology to do what he actually wants to do. So, why not make free software in generally, and GNU/Linux in particular, more userfriendly? \r\n\r\nP.S. Tech-savy user will profit too: the more people using GNU/Linux the more people will be willing to pay for support.\r\n\r\nP.P.S. The craftsman from the beginning who isn't skilled at writing might be glad if he can use a microphone or a camcorder and his connected computer to spread his thoughts to the world in other ways than writing a text."

People dont want to spend hours configuring there wireless laptop with ndiswrapper and sound drivers. If they install the OS and it doesnt work all they know is that it doesnt work and they will go back to MS Windows if it doesnt work.Another thing I see is that linux communities are very seperated. Theres thousands of different Linux OS's trying to find and fill another niche. What these communities of developers should be doing is investing there time to be worth while helping create one of the more popular distribution like opensuse, fedora, ubuntu, freespire, PC LinuxOS, or Xandros. Instead the community continues to seperate itself and allow linux as a whole to be less impacting on the non-linux community.

I was thinking of more ideas around the reading/writing/computing analogy, especially after reading some of the comments to Anthony's post today here and at digg.\r\n\r\nIt seems there are a lot of people who resent the popularization of GNU/Linux and the move to being more of a mass-market product.  We can look again at reading and the different kinds of books out there.  Should the nuclear physicist be offended that in addition to books in her field, there are also books for people who just want to learn how to build a patio for their house?\r\n\r\nI'd emphasize the comments that mention there are still plenty of interesting and cutting edge things to do in GNU/Linux and it is far from being boring.

Some Linux distros include closed-source apps and drivers as standard, others give you the choice if you want them or not, and yet others refuse to include them. But even in the last category, they still can't stop you from downloading and installing such things anyway. This is Linux--you are always free to choose what you want and don't want to run.\r\n\r\nIt's a free market, and purveyors of closed-source software are increasingly finding that they have to compete with open-source. I think the balance is inexorably shifting to the latter, but it's a slow process, and closed-source will have a place in the market for a while yet.\r\n\r\nLawrence D'Oliveiro"

    body: "I agree with you totally here.  I've been playing with computers since the days of Apple-DOS and MS-DOS.  I've worked my way up through Windows, and have started to work with Linux.  In fact, I was in college learning to program in arcane languages (read COBOL and FORTRAN) when Linux first came out on floppies.  \r\n\r\nYet, I'm still a newbie.  Even though I've built computers, and have installed various versions of Windows (including being a beta tester for Server 2003 R2, Vista, and Longhorn), jumping into the Linux side of things was hard.  I've never had to use programs like makefile in order to install anything before.  Like most of the \"newbies\" or \"dummies\" that people slam, I was used to clicking on a exe or bat file, and it does the rest.  \r\n\r\nWhether anyone likes it or not, that is going to be one of the things that makes Linux great.  The ability to click on an installer, and have it do everything for you.  Yes I totally agree that the power in Linux lies in the command line.  And, I tell everyone that I talk with about Linux, this very same thing.  I've even gone so far as to show them on older versions of Windows, where the power was (and that Microsoft decided that we were too dumb to handle that power, so they hid it from us).  And when I've had it available to me, I've shown them in Linux as well.  \r\n\r\nThe problem is this.  A solid majority of the people who will **consider** switching to Linux are not going to want to learn the command line.  They're going to want it to be simple, like they're used to in Windows.  They're going to want to click on a program, and have it install the program they are trying to get.  \r\n\r\nOur job is this.  One, help them by making the installers work.  That way, the users will make the move over to Linux.  Then, our job is to make sure they learn the command line.  For that is where the true power lies.  We shouldn't ridicule them for not knowing the command line.  We should encourage and educate them about it.  Once they start to get a feel for it, and the other advanced features of Linux, they'll move from the \"GNU/Linux\" distros to the \"beefier and more manly distros\".  But our job is NOT to scare them off.  \r\n\r\nI'll go so far as to say this.  If you can't help the newbies without ridiculing them, then keep your fingers to yourself.  In other words, if you can't say anything nice, don't say anything at all.  While I agree with the author (Scott) in that you should help out a little, I have to say that if you're going to help me, but ridicule me in the process, I'd rather you don't help me at all.  I'm sure someone else will help me-- without feeling the need to make me feel like I'm too dumb to use Linux.\r\n\r\nPatrick."

    body: "I think you are in the right ballpark in your thinking about computer literacy (a term that seems to have fallen out of favor) being as important as \"regular\" literacy.  And I also think you are right about it being a generational process.  And if the \"keep them dumb, ignorant, and non-free\" forces don't get draconian laws passed, I think it is likely to happen more or less on its own.\r\n\r\nI remember 25 to 30 years ago when it was common for people to advocate the need for computer literacy.  And then the Macintosh came out.  When the small tech company I was working for got its first Macintosh (which resided in the president's office, but I could access it after hours) some of us started questioning whether the general populace needed to be computer literate after all;  they could just point and click their way to nirvana.  Boy were we wrong!\r\n\r\nIt is only now that we are beginning to see any significant part of the adult population who have been around computers for essentially their whole life.  In most cases their parents only started struggling with computers (and in most cases it was a struggle) as adults.  As these young adults start having their own kids, I think you will see dramatic changes in the population's relationship to computers.  At least if things are kept free enough that those who desire can explore as far as they wish.  And particularly if they can encounter different software/OS's so that they can actually learn about computers rather than learning about a (ahem) particular company's software and thinking that is the beginning and end of computers.\r\n\r\nAs I scan back through your blog I don't see it, but I believe you suggested that computing freedom will become increasingly necessary for other freedoms as we move into an increasingly digital world.  I agree.  As such maintaining digital freedom becomes a moral imperative.  The biggest challenge for us now is to keep things from getting so locked down that the natural progression toward computer literacy does not have a chance to blossom."

When Scott says “dumb”, I think he really means “dumb about this particular specialized knowledge set”.\r\n\r\nBut I think emphasizing that many scientists and engineers have the same problems with computer integration and maintenance shows just how important this issue of specialization is: you can be awfully smart and still be inexperienced or have poor aptitude for computers.  And I'm going to think twice before calling a guy with a Nobel prize “dumb” for not being able to figure out KDE's menus.\r\n\r\nGood interfaces are supposed to eliminate or reduce those kinds of barriers. Microsoft Windows is still better at that aspect and of course, Apple's GUI is far better than that (I'm trying to speak objectively, the truth is, Apple's is my personal least favorite and KDE my most -- but there are objective concepts of interface design and ergonomics that apply especially to new users). They've put a lot of expert human-factors people on their designs.\r\n\r\nThis isn't something that is so easy for programmers to do for themselves, because they have to “think like a novice” in order to get there.\r\n\r\nSome effort is being made to do this with Gnome and KDE, but we're a long way from the finish line.

I think, the next step in computer interfaces will be enabled through touch-screens which accept multiple touches at once. There's some <a href=\"http://cs.nyu.edu/~jhan/ftirtouch/index.html\">research</a> going on in this area, screens getting cheaper. Here an awesome <a href=\"http://tedblog.typepad.com/tedblog/2006/08/jeff_han_on_ted.html\">video demonstration</a>.\r\n\r\nIt would be terrific if a new Desktop Environment for GNU/Linux would be created which was built around an intuitive user interface especially designed for these touch-screens coming up. If it was really easier to use than todays mouse-based GUIs it could gain quite some market share. Bundled with a device, maybe similar to the 100$-Laptop, this could boost GNU/Linux adoption significantly and bring computing to an even broader public. It is really amazing what kind of interfaces we could create witch this Multi-Touch Interaction technology. Maybe someone who's into user interface design for GNU/Linux should team up with this Jeff Han, the guy leading the research."
