SCALE is on again. This year, Free Software Magazine will tease you about this ever-growing event with some numbers and some highlights. Hopefully, you will want to go as much the we do!

Some numbers about SCALE (some of them are estimates):

* Attendees in 2002 (SCALE 1x): **400** 
* Attendees in 2006: **1100**
* Attendees in 2007: **1300**
* Attendees in 2008 (forecast): **1500**
* Number of speakers: **70**
* Core organisers: **9**
* Volunteers working over the SCALE week-end: **45**
* SCALE-related emails received (and answered) by _one_ of the organisers: **5800**

If this is not enough to convince you, have a look at some of the key scoops:

* Is Misys releasing their open source connector API?
* Is Medsphere going to speak to the community for the first time since their lawsuit with the Shreeve brothers was settled?
* What is SCALE University? Does it have anything to do with LOPSA and SCALE offering 2 half-day tutorial sessions about anti-spam techniques and Xen and Virtualization on Linux?

Plus, some key speakers:

* Jono Bacon (Ubuntu) and  will talk about the coming of the GNU/Linux desktop. People who witnessed Jono's previous speech will not want to miss this one!

* Stormy Peters (OpenLogic) talks about the motives of contributing an open-source project on a volunteer basis

* Akkana Peck will talk about -- and demystify -- the GIMP

And this is only the beginning. Hopefully, I will see you there!
