But You missed my favorite Open Source Altnerative <a href=\"http://www.osalt.com\">http://www.osalt.com</a>. \r\nIt lets the users search for well-known commercial software - and lists primeraly high quality open source alternatives for these products. A really great resource.\r\n\r\nregards, \r\nEric"

    body: "I think there is a fundamental problem with this type of exercise. If the message you send out to people is, \"Use Linux! You can recreate all the good bits of your Windows experience without difficulty!\" then you are setting people up to become majorly disillusioned.\r\n\r\nWe need to be honest with people, and admit that there are gains and losses with moving from Windows to Linux, but that any losses in convenience are more than made up for by freedom and flexibility. People need to know they are moving to something that is *different* from Windows and that isn't trying to *be* Windows.\r\n\r\nYou see this so often on forums: people saying, \"Unless you Linux people can sort this out, you'll never beat Windows!\" Since when was \"beating Windows\" - rather than providing a free-as-in-freedom means of using a PC - the aim?\r\n\r\nI think that, in the end, people are not going to stick with desktop Linux unless they have an understanding of, and commitment to, software freedom. Only then can they understand why it is not *Linux's* fault that their ATI graphics card is a pain to configure, or why it takes so much work to get multimedia working properly."

    body: "Finding equivalent or alternative solutions is an important topic. What people do will not change if people replace Windows by Linux.\r\n\r\nFor example, I do a lot of writing and many translations bewteen french an english. OpenOffice works well for me, but I am still looking for dictionnaries running on Linux. I need both monlingual (french and english) and bilingual (french to english and english to french) dictionnaries. I haven't found them yet under linux. And the dictionnaries available with OpenOffice (or with MS Office) are far from enough for this task. They weill not give the subtleties of the meaning of a given word, nor the expression to use in a given case, and so on.\r\n\r\nI looked at all the sites mentionned by the author. These sites are interesting, but I did not yet find a dictionnary.\r\n\r\nMarie-NoÃ«lle Baechler\r\nBelmont-sur-lausanne / Suisse\r\n"
