    body: "That's a pretty good list. The \"stack\" that I've settled on for projects is the following:\r\n\r\n- Launchpad for project management - bug tracking, idea tracking, translations and downloads\r\n- Wordpress for the site (normal pages + news + rss)\r\n- Tuxfamily.org for the site hosting\r\n- IRC - just use a link to mibbit for browser-based irc, otherwise people have their own client\r\n- bbPress for forums.\r\n\r\n... and I'd never use a wiki as a website.

There are plenty of other open ones like JOOMLA with similar capabilities.\r\n\r\nTrue but this is not a review of the best fit or even the most popular. It's a guide on what kind of things are available. Would you have been happy if Terry had included details of Joomla as well? What about other CMS - should they get a look in? Finally how long do you want this piece to be?\r\n\r\ncheers  \r\nRyan"

It sure is.\r\n\r\nI even _said that_: _Drupal_ because FSM uses it; _Plone_ because _I_ use it; _LAMP_ because it is clearly the most popular approach (and older).\r\n\r\nWriting a truly balanced and comprehensive list would be an enormous undertaking for one person.\r\n\r\nHowever...\r\n\r\nPlease note that 1) this article and illustrations are under a free content license and 2) we have a \"reply with post\" option at FSM. You could certainly make an effort to supplement this list with your own preferences, either here, or on your own site.\r\n\r\nBut I warn you that it is a deceptively time-consuming task! Just when I thought I was nearly done, I spent about three days finding, collecting, checking, and formatting links to packages."
