    body: 'I have used Attachmate products back in the day circa 1997.  The were the leaders back then in add in SNA/SDLC and 5270 Serial cards for the PC that would allow the PC to connect to IBM Mainframe backends.  There was aslo a server product IIRC that allowed multiple PCs on a LAN to share the PU''s and LU''s that were assigned from the Mainframe so as multiple PCs could use 1 PU rather than having a PU for every PC on the LAN connected to the mainframe.  A kind of a NAT to go between LAN connections and the Legacy IBM SNA/SDLC Serial connections.  It was quite nifty back in the day.  So I can say that I had first hand experience with some of their products.  They were  not a troll back then and they did make solid solutions back in the day.   As far as what they have been up to these days?  I have not a clue.  Anything with Microsoft setting up some shell group and colluding to get these patents scares me though.  I am one of the few that knows that when it comes to Free Software MS will be hostile first and hostile always no matter what their PR team says,  No matter what gestures they make they will do their best to continue to badger companies into paying them protection money for GNU/Linux related patents.  The list is long, TomTom,(Mobile Devices) LG,(Embedded Devices)  Buffalo(Servers), Amazon(Servers and Mobile Devices), HTC(Mobile Devices),  I-O Data(Servers) and this is just a fraction of the list.  MS claims over 600 companies have capitulated and signed Linux Patent Royalty Deals.  So my question is this:  In reality, who is winning here?  Also is there anyway FSM could do an article that compiles a list of all the companies known to sign these patent deals with MS and maybe some follow up articles with in depth analysis on these GNU/Linux extortion royalty deals?  I think it would be quite informative.  Thanks. '
