    body: "Of course, most distributions are already available for some fee, and some of that money goes to developers and maintainers.\r\n\r\nFor example, when I buy Debian on CDs (or more likely DVDs nowadays), I can choose from a number of suppliers. Some of them either donate an advertised fraction of the cost of the disks or provide an option to add a donation to the purchase. Socially conscious buyers will generally be inclined to pay a small amount, especially when they are already spending money on the disks themselves. The money goes to the non-profit corporation \"Software in the Public Interest\" that is Debian's sponsoring organization. I'm not certain about how the money is used, but I suspect this is how they pay for the machines that Debian runs its services on.\r\n\r\nI don't generally donate any money directly to Debian, but I always do when I buy disks. It's just easy to do when you've already got your wallet open, as it were.\r\n\r\nOf course, with broadband much more available than it used to be, I have less cause to buy disks. I'm not sure where that will lead.\r\n\r\nBut the idea is basically sound. Without restrictive licensing and prohibitions against copying, there is no way to _enforce_ such payments, but there are a variety of ways to _encourage_ them. I _suspect_ this is what the author was originally promoting, albeit in a somewhat provocative way.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand...\r\n\r\nIf you did manage (somehow) to change the licensing, you could make the pricing mandatory -- but only at the expense of _destroying the product_. Because, basically, if you take away the free license, there's no real point to GNU/Linux (if you want a proprietary Unix, you can buy one now from several vendors).\r\n\r\nYou could argue (as some have) that the product has intrinsic quality that would still exist if the licensing were proprietary -- but that would be a fleeting benefit, because the free license is what _keeps_ it at such high quality.\r\n\r\nFortunately for all of us, the legal process required to change the license is _extraordinarily_ difficult (because of the terms of the GPL, the ridiculous duration of modern copyright terms, and the extremely distributed ownership of the copyrights in important free software projects). So, it's very likely that no one would succeed in making such a transition.\r\n\r\nThere was of course, a useful test case which provides empirical support for that: when Xfree86 converted to a non-free license, practically all contributors jumped ship and created the X.org fork, which effectively replaced XFree86 (which for all intents and purposes is frozen and dead now). That was over just reintroducing the old BSD advertising clause -- you can imagine what would happen if more substantive changes were to be made.\r\n"

    body: "Distro's are charged for but in those cases you are rarely paying for the licence itself which seemed to be the point of the original article.\r\n\r\nI'm quite happy for people to charge for services -- like distro compilation, testing, media etc. -- or even the software itself but in the case of the latter you can't sustain the model.\r\n\r\nThe original piece also made a slight mistake in comparing two fundamentally different products and markets. The professional sports ticket analogy is a cathedral model in its purest sense.\r\n\r\ncheers  \r\nRyan"
