Finally, all those years of intelligent British TV have paid off—a judge there has [spoken out against software patents](http://news.com.com/U.K.+judge+frowns+on+software+patents/2100-1012_3-6027097.html?part=rss&tag=6027097&subj=news). Some of Sir Robin Jacob’s criticisms are classic:


>“The United States takes the view that anything made by man, under the sun, can be patented. And they have granted patents for business methods, mainly computer business methods. But as far as I can see, it would cover a new and improved method of stacking oranges on a barrel.”

Ah, yes. Now if only we could get some judges like Jacob on this side of the pond!
