    body: "The third sector is wider than \"not-for-profit and non-governmental\" or the old \"Voluntary and Community Sector\".  From the Office of the Third Sector's web site:\r\n\r\n\"What is the third sector?\r\n\r\n[...] It encompasses voluntary and community organisations, charities, social enterprises, cooperatives and mutuals both large and small.\"\r\n\r\nIt's rather disappointing that many of us working in the third sector were only told about this event <em>after</em> it happened.  Why wasn't it in FSFE's newsletters?\r\n\r\nIs there also a small error in a subhead: should \"sopa\" be \"soap\" or have I missed a joke?\r\n"

    body: "\"Non-governmental\" is fairly wide in it's scope. From Wikipedia:\r\n\r\n<cite>\"A non-governmental organization (NGO) is a legally constituted organization created by private persons or organizations with no participation or representation of any government. In the cases in which NGOs are funded totally or partially by governments, the NGO maintains its non governmental status as far as no government representatives are part of the organization.\"</cite>\r\n\r\nIt <em>could</em> be argued that social enterprises, cooperatives and mutuals fall into that description but that's just semantics really. :o) I <em>was</em> being a little liberal with my use of third sector but it was really to save me from writing \"voluntary & community sector and non-governmental organisations\" all the time. \r\n\r\nAs for notification, I received an advert on a mailing list I am a member of at least three weeks before the event. I guess you'll have to ask the FSFE why it wasn't on their newsletters. The day was well received and I know M6-IT and others (myself included) are looking to produce other such days. If/when I hear of anything I'll put either on here or on http://www.fsdaily.com .\r\n\r\nSpotted the typo after submission - typically :o)"
