Focus on the freedom to use, tinker, and distribute software. \r\n\r\nIn my business, I only use free software. Unfortunately, the commonly available free software apps don't adequately solve my business needs so I needed to hire a vendor to document the software and improve the deficiencies. \r\n\r\nI can tell you now that it would have been cheaper and quicker for my situation to buy licences for non-free software and be done with it compared to hiring the vendor to fix up the free software. \r\n\r\nI chose to not buy non-free software for the purpose of not being subjugated to the vendor(s) of that software. The cost of freedom my this case was more than just a bit of money but also time and convenience.\r\n\r\nFocus on the freedom aspect of free software. This may cost you more money and time compared to convenient non-free software but with free software, you're not going to be subjugated by a vendor.\r\n"

It has taken me over three years to develop a information system to support all of the programs. Each one has to meet its federal and state reports and with standards changing so quickly it can be quite hard to do it on your own.\r\n\r\nMost of all the systems run on Apache PHP and two forms of SQL, my SQL and PostgreSQL. I hope to add some Ajax to the mix next year. "

    body: 'Your points are well taken and free is not necessarily the best solution; but can often be a start. It''s not much use to anyone if the software is free and also not very good; but if it''s usefulness is high, is flexible and scalable and secure...then you are at least starting with a solid base. In my experience with case management software, there were no off the shelf systems that worked out of the box. All needed some customization for each agency..so there was always additional costs, time delays and many many meetings to get this stuff done...which half the time (or more) was much less than successful anyway.'

    body: "Note that the poster you are responding to said that proprietary software would've been <em>cheaper</em>, he didn't say \"better\". In fact, as I read it, he says the opposite: he chose the better alternative, even though it cost a little more.\r\n\r\nI think that this can also be stated in terms of long-term versus short-term costs. Proprietary software costs more out of the box, but free software may cost more to integrate into your system. After that, though, free software is likely to be cheaper to maintain for the long haul, over proprietary software which will have to be periodically replaced and re-integrated. Free software grows with you, while proprietary software is like a set of clothes you have to keep replacing as you grow.\r\n"
