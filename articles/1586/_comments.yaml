    body: "<p>This sounds about right to me. I don't think Adobe can control the PDF standard anymore. Of course, unfortunately, the fact of this happening is likely to make companies think twice about the advantages of creating and/or embracing an open standard. This is one of those cases, where, had Adobe kept the standard locked-up, they would be in a better legal position to pursue their case.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That doesn't change the ethics of the situation, but it does give companies a financial incentive for lock-in, and that is likely to be trouble down the road (but we were already heading there anyway).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I used to think that PDF and Postscript were both closed standards, and that that was one of the \"dirty little secrets\" about the GNU/Linux world (that we rely so heavily on them), but I was convinced otherwise by advocates of those standards, and had a look at the terms under which the standards documents were made available -- they were indeed \"free\" in my opinion (although of course, they are both controlled by Adobe rather than by a neutral standards organization, but that's not necessarily a bad thing so long as the control consists of persuasive leadership rather than restrictive domination -- and that's the distinction that the free standards provide).</p>\r\n"
