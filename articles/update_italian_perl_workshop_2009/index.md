Unfortunately, due to personal problems, Dave Rolsky will not be able to give his World Class day's training on Moose. The Moose community will be represented anyway by Mike Whitaker (penfold). We hope to host Dave at the YAPC::EU 2010.

The other special guests (Tim Bunce, Thomas Fuchs, Amy Hoy, and Jonathan Worthington) confirmed their talks. 

For up-to-date information just keep an eye on the [conference web site](http://conferences.yapceurope.org/ipw2009/) and [twitter](http://twitter.com/ipw09).

See you in Pisa!
