The Unbuntu/Debian way just didn't work but when I modified the fstab it worked perfectly.\r\n\r\nAlso you have to install the host additions on the guest OS.\r\n\r\nMy big gripe with VirtualBox is on my WinXP host running Ubuntu I can't seem to get USB to work and there seems to be no one else with this problem and a fix yet either. \r\n\r\nI have tried VMware, Xen, Virtual PC (Puke and Choke), and VirtualBox. \r\n\r\nVMWare on a Windows host seems to work with little or no fiddling. However when I installed VMWare on a Linux host I spent days configuring a fixing their install. I also had many annoying minor bugs like an marker file named \"not_configured_yet\" (or something similar) showing up everytime I booted the host machine. The guy who wrote the rc script I think might have been from the seventies and suffering from LSD flashbacks. His shell scripting was a nightmare to follow and I taught Unix for years. \r\n\r\nVirtualBox however installs and runs on a Linux host flawlessly (at least for me it did.) But I did not feel VirtualBox was a good choice on a Windows host. This may only be because Windows does not play well with other operating systems.\r\n\r\nXen was arcane and complicated to setup and I had to run Ubuntu's Xen kernel which mean I would have had to re-compile a boat-load of support plus tweek stuff for a week so I didn't try.\r\n\r\nVirtual PC (Piece of Crap) was horribly slow loading from the CDROM. I spent an hour trying to figure out how to mount an ISO file which helped a bit. By the way, it only supports 16 color/pixel display which is why Ubuntu needs to be loaded in the Safe Mode (Ubuntu's default color depth is 24 color) and navigating with no mouse is painful at best. In order to get a mouse support or sharing between the host and the guest you need to load the host/guest additions software but, you probably can guess that Microshit doesn't supply a Linux version. Go figure huh, with everybody gagging on Vista you would think they would prefer you to run Linux on Windows not the otherway around. But I guess when you think you are the only game in town you get a false sense of security."

    body: "i've been using the debian virtualbox packages (originally \"virtualbox\", now \"virtualbox-ose\") for a month or so now and i'm really impressed by the speed.  my desktop is an AMD Athlon XP 2100+ (1700 MHz K7), about 5 year old technology, and qemu was slow and almost unbearable.  the worse part is that i couldn't enable guest-supervisor-acceleration in kqemu (only guest-userland) without my windows guest spontaneously rebooting, blue-screening, or unexplainably failing windows updates.  with near daily use, i've only had virtualbox crash a guest on me once.\r\n\r\ni recompiled the debian packages for ubuntu feisty/7.04 for my wife (only needed to recompile debian's kbuild package for feisty to satisfy virtualbox-ose's build-depends), but the speed-up over (k)qemu isn't as noticable on her hardware (AMD Athlon 64  3000+; 1800 MHz K8).  neither is virtualbox's user-friendlier interface an improvement over qemu for her as she only used virtualization for one windows application and she didn't need to mount media, create shared folders, manage snapshots, launch multiple guests, etc (though i appreciate being able to do that from a gui instead of through a terminal and the filesystem).  so if you are on fast hardware and have simple use-cases, then (k)qemu is sufficient.\r\n\r\nmy only want/need is for virtualbox to support compaction/compression in their disk format (guest-integrated by vmware or semi-manually like qemu).  i would also be nice to branch snapshots to support different guests (like with qemu's base_image support, where an image can be the base for one or more new images).\r\n\r\nif you found (k)qemu too slow or manually intensive, may i recommend virtualbox ose (open source edition)."

    body: "This thread has been inactive for several months, so maybe nobody will hear me, but here goes.  I used to use vmware exclusively.  Now, I am messing with new (to me) contenders in the arena.  So far, I like Xen.  But, I am also intrigued by VirtualBox.  Seems very nice.  Even though it is probably not as fast as baremetal Xen, it's got some real positives.  Which leads to my question.  If I wanted to install VBox on a light distro with minimal gui, what would you suggest?  I started out with Ubuntu server & headless install (which I have not completely ruled out), then moved to Ubuntu desktop, then onto Xubuntu in the hopes of gaining some speed.  I messed with Arch Linux some, but gave up after being unable to make nvidia ethernet on the mobo work.  Any suggestions would be appreciated.  While headless VBox is an option, it will be easier to delegate admin duties if a lightweight gui was available.\r\n\r\nTIA\r\ncoz"
