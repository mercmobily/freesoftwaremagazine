You can make short files called scripts that when you run them by typing their name, initiate a long command for you. In that case you could do ps with lots of options added and formatted the way you like it when you type SHOWPROCESSES.

As *NIX is gaining more and more popularity we are seeing many more people just using kill -9 like it should be default.  There is a reason that a process should be given a SIGTERM, SIGINT then SIGHUP.  The reason being that programs are written to where they catch these signals and perform cleanup processes.  A SIGTERM will typically tell the program that the user wishes for it to go ahead and close all file descriptors after telling it's children(if child processes have been forked) to close up shop.  A SIGINT is then used to Interrupt the program from whatever it is doing and close up shop.  A SIGHUP, commonly rebound to re-read the configuration file, is a Terminal Line Hangup which should, by default, tell the program to not wait for children to respond via their pipes and just close the file descriptors and die.  The evil SIGKILL tells the process to just die and not worry about what it might have been doing.  SIGKILL can leave ZOMBIE child processes and ghost logins.\r\n\r\neg: If you were to ``sleep 9999& kill -9 $$''  then you may notice that you will often have a ghost login AND the sleep process will still be alive after your shell is dead.  If, instead, you were to issue that as ``sleep 9999& kill -1 $$'' then you will find that there is no ghost login and the sleep process should have been reaped by your shell as it exited cleanly.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn a side note: one does not have to quit from ``top'' in order to kill a process.  Simply pressing 'k' while viewing top will prompt you for the PID(and signal depending on the OS and distro.)  One can perform many actions from within ``top'', just press 'h' to see the different shortcuts."
