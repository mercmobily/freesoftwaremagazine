    body: "Just as someone who has had to deal with Steve Lake in an administrative function, I would highly suggest not taking his site or him personally very seriously, or lending any credibility to his efforts.  His attempt to build his website was accomplished via attempting to steal advertisers from Sudhian.com, a site he was a trusted administrator for for years.  Previously he was banned from a wide list of forums/websites for a variety of issues, including multiple personality disorder(Anandtech) and attempts to fracture the communities he was involved with.\r\n\r\nHis website forums on Raiden's Realm have in the past hosted hate speech(I can provide archived examples if needed) towards various ethnic groups, people of other sexual orientations and religions, including statements made by Mr. Lake himself.  Much of this material was cleaned up a few months ago, however it still exists in hidden sections of his forum where like minded white/christian supremecists can congregate to share thier views.\r\n\r\nI understand the need to expand the free software movement, and to encourage newer people to join the cause.  However I highly suggest doing your homework on some of these people who pop out of nowhere.  You may be suprised by what they are connected with.  Ultimatly such individuals/groups will serve to discredit the cause you are promoting, and that would be a tragedy.\r\n\r\nBeing as I found this article late, I doubt anyone will see this post.  However before joining their 'community', I *highly* suggest doing some outside research on Mr. Lake and his known associates.  Its not a pretty picture."

    body: "Yes, there's truth out there about Mr. Lake, but you apparently don't care for the truth.  I've done my research and found your statements to be flat out lies and slander.  The only exception might be the Anandtech situation.  But based on his past history, his actions there appear to have been part of a large forum game, and thus meant to be playful rather than destructive.\r\n\r\nAs for the rest of your lies, I suggest you pack up your bigotry and go elsewhere.  The truth that's out there paints a far different, and more flattering picture of Mr. Lake than you appear to be willing to accept in that narrow, closed mind of yours."

    body: "Attention all readers.   The person who is slandering Steve and his website is a person better known as one of the head moderators over at Sudhian.com   This person is beneath contempt and on record for going out of his way to defend child rapists not to mention a very sordid history of his own.   Most of the people who joined Steve’s website were kicked out or left Sudhian for their censorship, lies and intimidation tactics.   They also use bigotry as part of their arsenal against anyone who disagrees with them.\r\n\r\nRadian's relm is without a political forum and operates soley as a fun place for people to chat about technology and everyday life.  Sudhian.com was loosing members left and right into the double digits to Radian's realm because of their practices and even after nearly a year of silence from their former members this person have proven they cannot move on.\r\n\r\nPlease, check out Steve’s website for yourselves before allowing someone with an axe to grind make your decision for you.\r\n"

Every statement I have made can be backed up by others.\r\n\r\nThanks to FSM for not censuring my initial post, I will leave it at that.  As long as it stands, it does not really matter what comes after since those who think its important will investigate on their own.  For those who do not feel it is important, that is thier choice."
