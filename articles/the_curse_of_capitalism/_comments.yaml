    body: "Wow! I think you're spot on here :D \r\n\r\nThe desire of many people in the modern world to bring everything back to economics and statistics is incomprehensible in my opinion. These people need to get out and find something they love to do, then they might see things differently! \r\n\r\nAfter saying all that about statistics: there was a report compiled in 2005 by some people at MIT about the motivations of free software developers. They reached the conclusion that there are a large number of motivations, but to me their report suggested that the primary reason was that many people reach a \"state of flow\" while developing software, and it's this exhilaration that drives them to work. Not to mention the desire to help others and share what we learn!"

    body: "Excellent piece. Very well thought through. I can completely relate to the: <cite> \"I find myself more akin to my pump-obsessed neighbor than ....\"</cite> paragraph. But, if I have one critique, it would be these 2 sentences: \r\n<cite>\r\n\"I am not against capitalism: it is a decent economic model. It would be nice if the United States would give it a try.\"\r\n</cite>\r\nThey aren't necessary, don't make sense in the context of the article, and sound a little like 'cya' for choosing too 'dangerous' a title... Breath easy, the article 'speaks' for itself.\r\n\r\nGood job\r\n\r\n"

    body: "I don't know about \"spare cycles\", I think this bloke, Anderson, has got a few fruit bats loose inside of his head. He needs to go and find himself a life, somewhere.\r\n\r\nAs you suggest, any attempt to generalise the intentions of Free Software developers is fraught with peril. Trying to make general assumptions, regarding the overall usage of the 'web', is even more so.\r\n\r\nFor instance, between 1996 and 2003, Australia had this federal 'Communications' Minister(IT supremo), with weird starey eyes, and almost no comprehension of the subject of his portfolio.\r\n\r\nThis burke thought the 'internet' was only populated with gamers and porn sites, so, he left Australian IT to languish in the dark ages, while the rest of Asia streaked ahead.\r\n\r\nBlokes like him, and this Anderson, are simply chicanes on the main straight of progress."

    body: "I partially agree with you.  I think Anderson is partially right.  Sometimes, programmers do open source stuff because they have too much time on their hands (<a href=\"http://virtualdub.org/\">VirtualDub</a>, while not open source, is an example of a developer with too much time on his hands.  And he admits it).  But often, like in the cases of Firefox and OpenOffice.org, it is to make a great piece of software.\r\n\r\nHowever, I do think that if a programmer got paid, he would spend a ton more time on the project.  Programmers seem (to me anyway) to get bored very quickly.  After a few months (or occasionally, years) they quit (leaving their product as ghostware).  If they were paid, maybe they'd stick around more...\r\n\r\n--\r\nAndrew Min"

    body: "Doing this (programming) because you love it - what a concept?\r\n\r\nPersonally, I think free and open source programmers are the brightest of the bunch.  I believe they also keep the proprietary programmers \"honest\".\r\n\r\nWhen someone does something for money, they are not necessarily in it for the end consumer.  FOSS is always in it for the end consumer.  Sure some programs have extremely long development cycles, or they are abandoned by the original programmer(s).  But that is also the beauty of FOSS.  Someone else (or group) can volunteer to help on the project or revitalize something that has died and make it new again.\r\n\r\nIt is in the arena of FOSS where new ideas are bred every nansecond.  It is entirely possible that a lot of FOSS was bred out of frustration of the programmer in the propritary (closed) arena.  What if they had an idea that didn't fit into the corporate model at that time, but they knew it would be useful to someone besides themselves.  FOSS is the place to release that creativity.\r\n\r\nLastly, I think a lot of FOSS programmers work for a living (programming or otherwise) so it is probably a real rush to know that their idea is not only useful to others but also liked.\r\n\r\nMoney is not everything and it will never be the only thing.  Long live the FOSS programmer."
