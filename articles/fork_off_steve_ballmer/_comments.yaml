What Stallman, Moglen and company are envisioning for the GPLv3 is also a "conspiracy against the public". They may talk about freedom but they don''t walk the walk. '

    body: "I chose to reply directly to this one comment, however my comments apply to every set of comments here.  And I want to apologize in advance for my long-winded rant here.  I can say for certain that some of the people at Microsoft use as much Linux and Open Source programs as some of you do.  I can also say for certain that the actual 'programmers' and most of their development teams do want to make quality products.  And in some (IMHO most) cases they succeed.  You're equating the entire workforce at Microsoft with the words of a few people who speak.\r\n\r\nI'm a strong advocate of Open source and Free Software (both free in cost and free in 'freedom of speech').  Do I agree with the Microsoft/Novell deal?  Nope.  Not at all.  Do I swear off Microsoft as the Great Satan?  Nope.  Not at all.  Microsoft is doing the same thing that RedHat, Novell, IBM, HP, Canon, Kodak, Johnson & Johnson, Ford, Toyota, and every other company on the face of this Earth is doing.  They're trying to make money.  Granted, they are stealing IP from other companies.  But, look at one of the options in KDE (in fact it's the option I have set up on my Debian desktop).  You can have KDE start up looking almost EXACTLY like Windows XP's startup.  If you want to throw stones, then KDE is stealing Microsoft's IP by using the same startup screen.  Yes, I know Microsoft probably stole it from Apple.  Which leads right back to my earlier statement about throwing stones.\r\n\r\nI have said before, and will say again.  If I could find a program (e-mail client) that can download every e-mail message from my hotmail/msn accounts, then I would switch over to Linux full-time.  I'm not talking about screen rippers, but programs that can get all 120 pages of e-mails.  Yes, I know.  I shouldn't even be using hotmail or msn.  Hmmmm.  My ISP (who bundled my msn account with their service) may or may not care if I use it.  But, I'm paying for the msn account, whether I want to use it or not.  And since it's cheaper then the other ISP's in my area, I'm not going to fork out more money as a matter of principle.  Unless someone else wants to pay the difference, since some of us live on tight budgets.\r\n\r\nI beta test for Microsoft, along with other companies.  Does that make me in league with Satan?  I would hope not.  Since I run my web server on Linux, using Apache.  I could very easily set it up on IIS.  In fact, it would have been easier to set up my web server on IIS and have everything working out of the box.  But, I chose to set it up on Linux.  As for my beta testing, it's really simple.  I don't care who the product is for (or who the manufacturer of the product is).  If I can help them to make it better, then I will.  Isn't that what most of you are doing with Linux and Free Software?  I know that it's what I'm doing.\r\n\r\nFor those of you who switched (or are dual-booting) to Linux from Windows, I present this question.  Overall which one was easier to learn and use?  I'm not talking about crashes and BSOD's or the occasional virus (which are around for Linux and Mac OS as well) or spyware.  I'm talking about just starting the computer, and using it.  Installing programs, and running things.  If you say Linux is, then I'd love to know what distro you're running.  Especially since it's the one that has installers for every program you want or use.  \r\n\r\nFinally, I love the constant complaining about BSOD's and crashes with Windows.  And the constant quote of \"cleaning all of the viruses and malware off of the computer\".  I've used Windows for the better part of 10 years (and DOS before that).  I've had three viruses on my computer.  All three of them, I knew I infected myself, and I prevented them from spreading.  I've had some ad-ware on my computer.  But nothing that made my computer stop running, or require a reformat or other extreme methods to fix.  Oh wait.. I did install Xupiter one time.  That trashed my computer within about 30 seconds.  But, I don't think that it was something that could be attributed to Windows.  More likely, it was something that was attributed to XUPITER.\r\n\r\nMy point is this.  And this point holds true, regardless of whether you run Windows, Linux, Solaris, Mac OS, or any other Operating System.  If you get infected by anything (or your customers get infected by anything), it's because you (or your customers) didn't do enough to protect yourself.  For the people who will reply here that they are protecting themselves by dropping Windows, and going with Linux, I say this:  In a few years, when there are as many viruses and malware attacking Linux as there are Windows, then I want you to come back here and tell me \"I'm protecting myself by dropping Windows and switching to Linux.\"  Right now, I want you to look at how secure Linux and Mac OS is, compared to Windows.  You'll find three things.  1) They are all insecure.  2)  No one is looking at Linux or Mac OS as 'potential targets' and 3)  The only difference between the insecurity of Linux and Windows is the amount of time it takes for a fix.  Although there are still issues in Linux that have been around for years.  Just like there are issues in Windows that have been around for years.\r\n\r\nFinally (and I know if you're still reading at this point, you're breathing a huge sigh of relief).  Some of you would love to see a world that has only Linux and Open software, without Microsoft or Windows.  Just like some people would like to see a world where it's just Microsoft and Windows, with no open software.  The truth is, the world is going to have both.  Businesses, Schools, and even homes will have both.  Get used to it.  Get over it.  Instead of talking about how great Linux is over Windows, and how Microsoft and anyone who even considers the possibility of liking their products, is in league with Satan, try fixing your problems.  Standardize Linux.  It's totally stupid that only one or two distros (that I know of) can install using either .deb or .rpm files.  EVERY distro should install using whichever file you have.  If you're developing programs, then you need to develop them for both formats.  Read this next sentence carefully and pass it on....\r\n\r\n  ********** The easier that you make it to install and use programs that the average person will want, the easier it will be to convince the average person to switch to Linux. ************ \r\n\r\nYou're not making your job any easier.  So, get on the ball.\r\n\r\nWhat sites are out there that are trying to standardize Linux????  Do you know, and do you have links?  Are you doing ANYTHING to help those sites to succeed?  Or are you just sitting on the bench, and whining about how you have to clean other people's computers, because they won't switch to Linux?  If I was a developer or a programmer of any merit, I would be doing whatever I could to make the Linuxbase or the GNU projects work.  I'm not, so I'm trying to put a fire under the butts of those of you who are...\r\n\r\nPutting on my fireproof suits, because I know that a flame war is coming...  As always, I could be and probably am wrong on some of this.  Feel free to correct me constructively.  I'll be happy to learn something new, if you'll be happy to teach me.\r\n\r\nPatrick.\r\n<a href=\"http://www.kab.org\">Support Operation Green at http://www.kab.org</a>\r\nSmile....

Likewise, after a few hours, I can have Windows system doing what Microsoft wants me to be allowed to do.\r\n\r\nDiscounting the lack of ethics in Microsoft's business practice on the grounds that \"they're just trying to make money\" is encouraging moral irresponsibility. <em>I'm</em> trying to make money too, but I'm not willing to do what Microsoft does to get it.\r\n\r\nI have no illusions that IBM or Red Hat is without fault ethically, but I think in the grand scheme of things they are -- at least currently -- behaving more ethically than Microsoft. And that does count for something.\r\n\r\nHowever, much more to the point, I don't have to believe Microsoft is \"the Great Satan\" to be annoyed and hostile towards it.

    body: "A number of points Patrick makes, concerning the operation of open software versus Microsoft, are true enough. \r\n\r\nWhen Open Office 2.0 was first released I installed it onto an old laptop with Debian 'Sarge', and an old Windows 98 partition, so I could run Frontpage(another area where open software is noticeably lacking). In the Windows partition I only had to click on the Open Office.exe and it installed itself in about 5 minutes flat. In the Debian partition I had to struggle to get a recalcitrant Alien to agree to convert the RPMs to Debs, along with a general reluctance for the OS to get the office suit up and running, without considerable frustration. Getting OO 2.0 up and running on my Mandrake desktop machine was yet another frustrating can of worms. So Patrick's criticisms of open software are perfectly valid.\r\n\r\nYet, a couple of years earlier, I had deleted the original Windows XP off of that same laptop, and hadn't regretted replacing it with a free software OS for one single second.\r\n\r\nWhen we consider Microsoft, we are not simply looking at another commercial software company trying to keep its head above water in the dog eat dog world of commercial enterprise.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is the biggest software corporation in the world, bar none.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft didn't get to this position of world dominance because it built a better mousetrap. It got there via the exploitation of the most cunning and ruthless business and legal strategy, not by the inherent quality of the software it was trying to flog.\r\n\r\nLook at it this way. You go down to the car yard to buy yourself a nice new Corvette. You go to take a look at the motor, but the salesman tells you, \"Sorry mate, the hood's welded shut because of all the secret patented engine equipment that has to remain hidden because you might try to copy it,\"\r\n\r\nThe thing sounds OK, and lots of flashing graphics come up on the dashboard to assure that its working OK, so you decide to buy it.\r\n\r\n\"Sorry mate, but the corporation doesn't actually 'sell' cars, they only 'lease' them to you under strict agreements of license.\"\r\n\r\nSo you figure it might still be worth all this BS just to listen to that ZO6 motor starting up each day and the thrill your wife and kids will get out of driving it.\r\n\r\n\"Other users,\" he says. \"well, for a special deal costing less than the leasing price of three Corvettes you can also let your kids drive it as well. But, if you want your wife to be able to drive it too, it might be better if you paid our special Corporate License Fee for 'Extended Usage', which will only cost you about the license fee for five Corvettes, and, for minimal extra individual charge, each user can obtain individual access to our special Bulk Users Privileges Package, with such handy extras as 'Door Lock', 'Starter Motor', 'Gear Box', 'Brakes' and 'Steering Wheel' being password activated at no further cost.\" This is typical of the crap deals offered to business organisations who want to use Microsoft.\r\n\r\nNot only that; you also get an OS that spies on itself, and tells their corporate lawyers and accountants whether all your leasing agreements are paid up to date and reports on the software payments of other users of Microsoft with whom you might happen to have any online dealings. \r\n \r\nIf you tried to sell cars with the same ridiculous terms attached as a Microdaft OS, you would be out of business in two days.\r\n\r\nApparently reputable business managers go out and tie themselves up with such unworkable and expensive deals. Go figure.\r\n"
