    body: " \r\n<strong>Comment from: Dave Guard [Member]</strong>\r\n\r\n    2005-10-31 @ 12:26\r\n    I've already overheard my seven year old son saying things like \"Those files won't work at school because we use Windows at school\" and \"We can't chat to Poppa while he's in Africa because he uses MSN and we use Ubuntu\".\r\n\r\n    While I know there are generally ways around these issues, it's still shocking to hear this sort of stuff coming from a seven year old.\r\n\r\n    Thankfully he's at least being given the opportunity to know that there is an alternative to the proprietary world.\r\n\r\n    So many adults have no idea what free software is. So to have children that are even aware of it is a fantastic thing.\r\n\r\n    We should do what Microsoft does - we should get to them while they're young.\r\n\r\n    Then we'll only have one more step to achieving world domination!\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>Comment from: Vincent [Visitor] Ã‚Â· http://lifelesspeople.com/forum</strong>\r\n\r\n    2005-11-04 @ 19:04\r\n    Lol, my parents are techno-fobes, but I'm a very strong supporter of open-source (16 years old, since yesterday :D ). What I've noticed is that because I (and a friend of me) am such a strong supporter of open-source that my other friend is a M$ fanatic all of a sudden, just because we're so positive about it :P . Anyway, at least you know there are some children that still have sense. If you look at the forum I set as URL, that's full of kids like me.\r\n\r\n"
