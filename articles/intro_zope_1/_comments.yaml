Ah well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr/>\r\n\r\n<strong>From</strong>: PaulC \r\n<strong>Url</strong>: \r\n<strong>Date</strong>: 2005-12-18\r\n<strong>Subject:</strong> reply\r\n\r\n\r\nhe did mention that to grok Zope you have to understand python... just wait... things will get much clearer... but first, you have to grok Python... ;)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat I love about Python, is that it's a very short jump from getting your thoughts about a program down in pseudocode to actually fleshing in the Python program itself.\r\n\r\n<hr/>\r\n\r\n<strong>From</strong>: Kirk Strauser  <b>(SUBSCRIBER!)</b>\r\n<strong>Url</strong>: \r\n<strong>Date</strong>: 2006-01-01\r\n<strong>Subject:</strong> That comes next month (or so)\r\n\r\n\r\nI really wanted to work a little about Zope into the article, but I just didn't have the room.  I decided to dedicate this part into an overview of Python since Zope very closely parallels the language.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKeep checking back for the next installment.  It should be more along the lines of what you're asking for.\r\n\r\n<hr/>\r\n\r\n<strong>From</strong>: Mike Meyer \r\n<strong>Url</strong>: http://www.mired.org/home/mwm/try_python/\r\n<strong>Date</strong>: 2005-12-31\r\n<strong>Subject:</strong> Trying out interactive python\r\n\r\n\r\nIf Python sounds interesting, but you don't want to install it, there\r\n\r\nare a couple of \"Try Python\" websites that let you play with a Python\r\n\r\ninterpeter with just a web browser.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMine is at http://www.mired.org/home/mwm/try_python/. It provides\r\n\r\nlinks to others as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr/>\r\n\r\n<strong>From</strong>: Kirk Strauser  <b>(SUBSCRIBER!)</b>\r\n<strong>Url</strong>: \r\n<strong>Date</strong>: 2006-01-01\r\n<strong>Subject:</strong> Excellent resource!\r\n\r\n\r\nYou're a braver man than I to allow people to run code on your server, but you seem to have dodged the most obvious bullets (infinite loops, etc).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI'll be sure to point your site out to people who want to have a quick peek at the language.  Thanks!\r\n\r\n<hr/>\r\n\r\n"
