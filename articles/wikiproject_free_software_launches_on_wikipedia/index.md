  On  Wikipedia, WikiProject Free  Software has launched.  The goals are to raise the quality of  existing free software articles and to fill in any information gaps about  the topic.  It's a new initiative and hasn't yet built up much  momentum, so I thought I'd mention here where it some free software  savvy people might see it and be interested in helping.

The [WikiProject Free  Software](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:WPFS) is definitely promising, and will definitely grow in the future.

  It's  over [a  year since I wrote](http://www.fsfe.org/en/fellows/ciaran/ciaran_s_free_software_notes/free_software_portal_on_wikipedia) about Wikipedia.  That was for the launch of  English  Wikipedia's [Free  Software Portal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal:Free_software).  When that portal launched, there were already  corresponding portals  in [German  Wikipedia](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal:Freie_Software)  and [French  Wikipedia](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portail:Logiciels_libres).

  Now, there are also free software portals in the  Wikipedia's  of [Arabic](http://ar.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D8%A8%D9%88%D8%A7%D8%A8%D8%A9:%D8%A8%D8%B1%D9%85%D8%AC%D9%8A%D8%A7%D8%AA_%D8%AD%D8%B1%D8%A9),  [Czech](http://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port%C3%A1l:Svobodn%C3%BD_software),  [Danish](http://da.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal:Fri_software),  [Spanish](http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal:Software_libre),  [Indonesian](http://id.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal:Free_Software),  [Russian](http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%9F%D0%BE%D1%80%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%BB:%D0%A1%D0%B2%D0%BE%D0%B1%D0%BE%D0%B4%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B5_%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B3%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BC%D0%BC%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B5_%D0%BE%D0%B1%D0%B5%D1%81%D0%BF%D0%B5%D1%87%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B5),  and [Chinese](http://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal:%E8%87%AA%E7%94%B1%E8%BB%9F%E9%AB%94).  The idea of portals is that for a given topic, they are a better  "front door" through which people can enter Wikipedia's  related content.

  Some interesting topics that could be better, IMO, include:


*   [History  of free software](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_free_software)
*   [Free  software licences](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software_licences)
*   [Patents  and free software](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patents_and_free_software)

  Actually, the licences article is pretty good, but it's  a great topic, so more review and contribution would still be good.
