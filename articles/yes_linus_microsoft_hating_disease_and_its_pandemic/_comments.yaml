    body: "It's the nature of free software that we can't hold on to competitive advantages, nor can we effectively exclude anyone, whether we like them or not.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it would be useful to imagine the result of _not_ including the code...\r\n\r\nConsider. Torvalds refuses the code, branding himself as an \"activist\" and alienating at least one faction of the people who support Linux.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft, or more likely Novell, adopts the maintenance of the patched kernel with the Microsoft code. That version of Linux supersedes kernel.org's for many users. In essence, it becomes a competing product, which is under tight control by Microsoft.\r\n\r\nNot only would that put Microsoft in full control of a \"value-added\" product, it can say it did so by _being more open than the community_, without using any proprietary licensing.\r\n\r\nDo I need to spell out the next few steps? This would be a disaster on multiple levels -- the best possible outcome would be that Linus eventually relents and lets the code back into the kernel.org kernel. \r\n\r\nIt's much better to adopt the code now and avert the disaster entirely. Sure Microsoft's motivations for submitting it are self-serving. That's the nature of corporate competition. But a simple-minded shunning of Microsoft contributions is not an effective response.\r\n\r\nTorvalds is sticking to his values, and it's the right thing to do, both ethically and politically. "

I actually find Steve Ballmer to be very entertaining and funny. I find Bill Gates to be a decent, likable, and misguided monopolist.\r\n\r\nThere is no hatred emanating from our camp. But there is jealousy emanating from Microsoft because GNU is such a powerful brand among developers.\r\n\r\nLinus Torvalds should stop misrepresenting the Free Software foundation. Resistance to being subjugated is not hateful nor is it extreme. It's the only response when someone methodically and deliberately tries to curtail your freedom using unfair business practices, lobbyists, ridiculous legal tricks and billions of dollars.\r\n\r\nLinus Torvalds needs someone to send him a GNU stuffed animal to remember how benevolent and good the GNU project is. There should be a complete reconciliation between the penguin and the GNU, rather than the penguin running into the sweaty embrace of Steve Ballmer."

They retain the copyright to their code, but it's now open for the Open Source world at large to take and modify it.\r\n\r\nThat Microsoft people usually have an 'agenda' can't be discussed: they do. However, this part of the code was released by MS engineers, many of which have actually publicly expressed interest in FOSS, if only as a development practice.\r\n\r\nLinus' disinterest in the code doesn't stem from his lack of understanding of the repercussions from it, but because he probably understands them better than you do; if, for any reason, Microsoft decides to attack Linux because of that code, Linus will merely remove it and be done with it; Microsoft will be banned once and for all from the community, and that will be all.\r\n\r\n---\r\nA computer is like air conditioning: it becomes useless when you open windows."

Were Linus worried about the politics of this matter, we would end up with a counter-intuitive exclusion of people from the community for no other reason than that they would be running the kernel in a Windows-based VM. \r\n\r\nThese are drivers, not an integral part of the kernel. Right now Linus isn't worried because there isn't anything to worry about. Sure, the code's purpose is to allow Linux to run under a Windows VM, as opposed to a native Linux system, but Linux IS being run. To me, this seems far better than the alternative of snubbing the code and thereby shafting people out of support, FORCING them into selecting one OS or the other. Does that tactic sound familiar to anyone? \r\n\r\nIf Microsoft DOES submit more core kernel code (task scheduling, memory management, etc), then start worrying.  "

    body: "I admit it - I like free (as in freedom) software, even when it costs money. In fact, I have and am willing to pay money BECAUSE it is free - that's how I want my software. My slogan would be \"I want to pay to stay free!\"\r\n\r\nThe dictionaries tells us \"hate\" is to \"dislike intensely; feel hostility toward; loathe; detest\". The dictionary even tries to give an explanation for it: \"intense hostility and aversion usually deriving from fear, anger, or sense of injury\".\r\n\r\nThey also tell us that \"evil\" is \"morally corrupt, motivated by intent to harm or destroy, producing destructive effects, characterized by bad acts or harmful effects\".\r\n\r\nGiven the above definition, proprietary companies don't even register on my \"hate meter\". I don't dislike them intensely, I don't feel hostility towards them, I don't loathe, detest or feel intense hostility and aversion to them either. Maybe it is because I don't fear them? They're benevolent stupidity may anger me sometimes when I can't do what I want to, or make me feel a sense of injury because of their mindbogglingly silly mistakes which prevents me from achiving my goal yet again - with no way to improve my situation using either my wallet or my wits. Unlike free software.\r\n\r\n\"Never attribute to malice that which can be adequately explained by stupidity, but don't rule out malice\" can be used to exclude intent, and I find this often quite handy in real life. Used on the above definition of \"evil\" we are left with a meaning of evil that is \"producing destructive or harmful effects\". Now, as evil things go, software is really low on my list. However, with this definition of evil, I definitely have proprietary software on my list of evil things in life. With this definition I also have the free software Ubuntu installer, which beautifully asks me for my chosen language and then does not make use of the information. I want Norwegian bokmål, that means æ, ø, å on the keyboard, that means daylight saving time does apply, that means Oslo is the capital of my country, Norwegian kroner is our currency and so on. Please, don't waste my time with stupid questions. No, \"some people might need it\" does not justify wasting time for \"the rest of us\". Not knowing how to multiply and feeding \"the elite\" is EVIL. Do you hear me, Mark Shuttleworth? \r\n\r\nI also wonder why revision control systems aren't automatically included as started daemons in all GNU/Linux distributions and used by default to track changes at least to the configuration directory /etc. This is also EVIL. \r\n\r\nWhy doesn't GIMP, Inkscape, Scribus, OpenOffice, KOffice, Kpovmodeler, Blender, Cinelerra or whatever auto-detect the company's revision control system and offer the user the chance to use it from their SAVE-dialogs? A group of professional graphic artists will rarely use free (as in freedom) software, because keeping track of file changes on a customer project including the Full Monty of advertising material - covering paper, TV and web - is paramount, and with the mentioned free software this isn't as easy as the proprietary offerings. In short, this is EVIL.\r\n\r\nPersonally then, I have failed to \"hate\" either proprietary or commercial free software, but I have felt their EVIL - no intent needed.\r\n\r\nStallman, and by extension the FSF, does talk about \"evil\" and \"moral dilemma\", like in this speech - http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/nit-india.html - yet, I find it very hard to find the word \"hate\" or take \"evil\" to mean anything else than \"harmful to the end user, regardless of intent\". \r\n\r\nI don't agree that the FSF is a \"hate site\" just because it finds proprietary software has harmful effects. That would be like saying the Ministry of Health is a \"hate site\" just because it warns people of the dangers of smoking.  \r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nHaakon Meland Eriksen"
