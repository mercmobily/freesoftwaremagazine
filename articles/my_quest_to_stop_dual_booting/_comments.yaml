I took the second option & installed only Debian on my machine.\r\n\r\nThe main issue what I see before kicking the dual boot habit is that every user will have atleast one Windows App which he feels is necessary. But we have to weigh the options & take a plunge. Once your are fully inside the water you will not feel the cold.\r\n\r\nI never looked back after that & I am now a very happy user with \"ONLY DEBIAN\" on my thinkpad for the last one & a half year."

    body: "how timely...\r\n\r\nyesterday after my wife's laptop stopped working for a day (only to have it unexpectedly make a comeback last night for no reason) she was ready to give up windows, as every other computer in the house runs linux, except for one budget/finance application.  all her other applications are already cross-platform open-source (firefox, thunderbird, openoffice).\r\n\r\ni won't touch vmware; no closed-source in my linux kernel (but i'm a little less militant in userland with flash and java).  virtualbox's integration on debian is too immature from what i've seen (non-debian-official closed-source deb & open-source version only in svn according to <a href=http://www.debianadmin.com/create-virtual-machines-using-virtualbox-in-debian.html>here</a>).  i don't have the hardware (VT or AMD-V) for windows on xen and even if i did i don't want the administrative overhead & infrastructure of xen.  i want something reasonably simple, self-contained, and approachable by a newbie (maybe requiring one-time set-up by an admin, that's me).\r\n\r\ni had experimented with qemu three or so years ago (where it took four hours to install windows 98), and had heard that kqemu, the kernel-side cpu-instruction execution-agent for qemu, had recently been open-sourced.\r\n\r\nthere's a debian package, kqemu-source, in unstable.  it should work for ubuntu as all you need is kernel headers and the tools to build debs (which should be dependencies of the package).  i built the resulting kqemu-module package on testing/\"etch\" and it compiled and installed fine.\r\n\r\ni set-up and launched qemu as described in the <a href=http://kidsquid.com/cgi-bin/moin.cgi/QuickStartGuide>quick start</a> and had windows 98 installed in 30 minutes.  (very different experience than previously.)  good thing about windows 98: under 300 MB for a minimal installation.  bad thing: 100% cpu utilization for the entire duration of its use (which heats my cpu like cpuburn, though you can find a few programs that issue the cpu HALT command when idle, but then windows 98 stutters and the user experience becomes choppy).\r\n\r\nso i also tried windows 2000 and settled on it.  the minimum install is ~750 MB, but it runs very smoothly with no cpu utilization when idle (after it settles down after booting, just as with a non-virtual desktop) and great performance the rest of the time (for a user-input-limited application).  user experience and cpu utilization is more important to me than a GB of disk space.\r\n\r\nthe command to start it is simply: \"qemu -localtime -hda hd.img -fda fd.img\" (as the floppy image will be used for storing the compressed data files for easy backup apart from the windows installation).  that's simplicity.  i may add network capability, which will require some administrative work on my part, but we don't download QIFs over the internet, so it's not really necessary.  i need to figure out how to print from within qemu, but we hardly need hard copies, so that's not a priority, and we can always print to a postscript file in windows and print it from linux.\r\n\r\nso, after my recent experience (yesterday), may i suggest qemu with kqemu on debian/ubuntu."

Win98 can only use qemu without the kqemu accelerator so it is a bit slow/choppy but the install was easy (from Synaptic or ''apt-get install qemu'') and the Win98 disk image was only 200MB. With PrintMaster installed the diskimage is 400MB.  For better performance install Win2000 or WinXP on qemu which can can take advantage of the kqemu accelerator.'

Maybe Windows will boot in safe mode the first time and recover from there???"

    body: "I'm an a Computer Science student and I currently have Kubuntu Edgy and XP Professional as dual boot installed. I can proudly say that I haven't booted Windows in months because I didn't need to. As I don't play games under Windows (but a few under Linux ;) ), and I didn't have any projects where I had to use MS-Products, and, thus, Windows, I was quite happy. But now, as the new semester begins, I see that the teachers still tend to be MS-dependent. Visual Studio, Excell, Access, they point on that when they speak of software. To find a really good alternative to Visual Studio is, indeed hard, but not impossible. I would also be more than thrilled to be learn about versioning systems like CVS, Subversion, but that's not even mentioned. I have to find my way in KDevelop, but it's quite difficult at start. \r\nWhat I want to say is that people should really try Open Source as an viable alternative, not to be stuck with MS. I try to do that as much as I can, but it's hard for me to change the minds of others. I am considering to start to ask (more or less) \"rethorical\" questions to the IT people at our university about Open Source products. As of now, they don't even want to install OpenOffice.org!\r\nUntil we (ITs) are forced by the industry and other factors to use MS-Products, I will still have to remain to my dual boot...\r\n\r\nPeace!"

If you already have the Windows license then you might as well run the thing on the physical drive and save your money from something else! VMware is a bad idea... I reckon you know that since you chose to be anonymous anyway! I am not putting VMware down, it has a very legitimate use but not as a crutch and you always know people who have no idea how to do anything, always offer up this utility for this stupid purpose!\r\n\r\nI can't tell this guy how to make cards other than using yahoo or something like that that email them and most people I have sent one to have been kind and seemed to really like them as they always seem to send some back to me. I do also agree with the Hallmark comment below, you can always make one by hand...\r\n\r\nAs for this guy's finance program if he uses Ubuntu, there is a program called Automatix that has a finance program ready for install. Just check it and you're off.\r\n\r\nJust dump the Windows and start looking for what you want... It may take a moment or an hour or some more time, but I guarantee when the programs are found you will be happy. "
