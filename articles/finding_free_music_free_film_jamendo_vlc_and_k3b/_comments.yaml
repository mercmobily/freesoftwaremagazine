    body: 'hey Terry.  i know your article (and magazine) is about free software but i''d also like to direct your attention to people like you.  except instead of telling stories with film and video they enjoy telling stories with music, composing music and helping others appreciate music.  that is their passion.  and while they may do it for pay, many also do it for free ... for projects that interest them ... especially if they are young and learning and perhaps still in school or looking to build their resume.  they are composers and they''d love to work with a person or team directly and be inspired by an interesting script or even a set of characters or situations.  so, i''m bringing this up as alternative which could suit yours and others'' purpooses better than even finding some bit of free music out there on the web.  get another person involved.  it may inspire you both.  cheers, trtrand'

    body: "In the article, I say I couldn't find a way to do a straight search by license. However, if you click on \"Music\" and select \"Creative Commons\" that page will let you simply search by particular CC license, with a choice of orderings (things like \"Popularity this Week\" or \"Most Downloaded\" or \"Most Starred\", etc). I could swear I tried this before and it didn't have this feature, though maybe my memory is faulty, but in any case it does work now.\r\n\r\nI've also found some other sites since posting this. In an upcoming column, for example, I will be exploring how to do license searches on http://wacca.fm, which is a Japanese music sharing site that also supports CC licenses.\r\n\r\n"

    body: "The problem with any volunteer art project is that people only want to do what they feel inspired about, which generally means original work.  A composer will usually want to tell _their_ story, not yours. (Which is entirely understandable).\r\n\r\nOf course, with a great deal of luck, you will occasionally connect with someone who has a similar enough vision that you can collaborate on a project, but this happens once in a blue moon. (The larger the project, with the more distinct creative elements, the greater the coincidence that is required).\r\n\r\nWhat usually happens instead (and this is what happens with big free software projects) is that a project gets big enough to be interesting. And _then_ your problem is usually too many volunteers. But you never get there if you wait for the volunteers to show up.\r\n\r\nSo, for a start-up project, it's much more practical to try to find already-existing materials which fit closely enough to be used as-is. After the project becomes more successful, you review this list of artists and you look for people who might be good choices to work with, and then you talk to them about it.\r\n\r\nTheir existing music and your existing visuals then become the signaling mechanism for deciding if you have sufficiently similar visions to work together.\r\n\r\nOf course, if you also have a revenue stream associated with the way you distribute your work, and you have a standing practice of sharing that out among contributing artists, then the possibility of making some money off of the project also becomes a motivator. But once again, that isn't very credible until the project is already launched and successful.\r\n\r\nSo there are start-up strategies and continuation strategies. From my experience in dealing with potential composers (I have attempted this in the past), the commission approach is better seen as a continuation strategy.\r\n\r\nIt might be different if the project were more centered on the music -- if I were creating visuals to match someone else's composition, for example.\r\n"

I recently discovered [http://icompetech.com ](http://icompetech.com) which has royalty free instrumental music created especially as backing for video, radio etc. It's all released under CC-By and is generally in clips short enough to make editing or sampling less of an issue.\r\n\r\nI'm not connected with the site BTW. I just thought it might be useful to list it here for people who are looking for music to add to their video.\r\n\r\ncheers  \r\nRyan  \r\n\\-\\-  \r\nEquitas IT Solutions - fairness, quality, freedom  \r\n[http://www.equitasit.co.uk](http://www.equitasit.co.uk)"
