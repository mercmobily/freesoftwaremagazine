    body: 'My experience over recent years at a local computer fair is that many people are now at least aware of GNU/Linux (or Linux), many have then decided it is not for their level of expertise - a mistaken judgment, except of course there are the hoops to be jumped in arranging suitable installation - no pre install here in GNU/Linux unfortunately. The opposition meme is that Linux - oh! only for geeks, not real everyday people! This has stopped GNU/Linux in its tracks. People know of it, but many just continue with their pre installed OS, no longer asking questions.'

Perhaps the reason you're feeling glum is because you've been playing stupid games of linguistic pedantry for so long that nobody wants to play with you anymore.\r\n\r\nGod bless the Linux operating system and all open source software!"
