    body: "The killer apps of the \"programmer's editor\" genre. I'm a vi user. Looks like yes indeed, I do have syntax coloring for PHP. Though, to be fair, it says \"PHP 3-4\".\r\n\r\nThere's also a dozen or more lesser-known editors with their own advocates.\r\n\r\nI've never much liked IDEs, myself. Too much upkeep. gVim (which is a vi variant) does what I need.\r\n"
