    body: "Thanks, Chris.  This is <a href=\"http://www.movingtofreedom.org/2006/12/23/moving-from-microsoft-money-to-gnucash/\">a subject of much interest to me</a> also.  I've been using MS Money since 1995 and expect it to be quite a project to get moved over to GnuCash.  I like the reports in Money and suspect I'll be doing without some of the things I really like to see.  I'm also curious how the import will work with classifications.\r\n\r\nLooking forward to more installments in this series!\r\n\r\n----\r\n<a href=\"http://www.movingtofreedom.org/\" title=\"Freedom is on the March!\">http://www.movingtofreedom.org/</a>"

It's fast and with the right tools very easy:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://mriou.wordpress.com/2007/01/04/linux-is-beautiful-especially-with-windows-software/\">http://mriou.wordpress.com/2007/01/04/linux-is-beautiful-especially-with-windows-software/</a>\r\n\r\nAlternatively you can run your stuff in <a href=\"http://www.parallels.com/\">Parallels</a>, you can run everything in it (it's a Windows VM for Linux), it's just a bit more heavyweight.:"

    body: "Hello, I face the same dilemma and found out about another app called Moneydance (moneydance.com) that seems pretty good.  I installed it and imported my .qif export from MS Money.  Sorry to say that I haven't tested it beyond that.  Maybe someday..  Btw, Moneydance is not free (there's a trial period however).  But, if it works well then I have no problem in buying the software.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\"Anonymous coward\"\r\nwhatever..\r\n"

    body: "I too was wedded to MS Money. I did not really like any of the GUI Linux alternatives. I dual-booted for awhile just to use Money. Eventually I hated dual-booting enough to switch to GnuCash. But then I found Ledger. It's CLI, which is a completely different paradigm, but I actually like it even more than MS Money and now you couldn't pry Ledger out of my hands.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.newartisans.com/ledger.html"

I''ve studied in finance, and done bookkeeping, and I really love Gnucash.  There are a few gtk GUI oddities if using it in KDE, but I barely notice them anymore.'
