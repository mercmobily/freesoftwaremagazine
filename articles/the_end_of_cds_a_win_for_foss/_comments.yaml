Flash drives are like tiny computers with circuitry.\r\n\r\nWhen you get flash drives with the same data capacity or more, same physical space or less, and same price or less as whatever the contemporary disc technology offers at the time, then we'll talk. Until then, flash technology will not be able to overcome the sheer mass distribution capabilities of disc technology."

IMHO, this doesn't offer a huge improvement over a LiveCD (they are read only after all)."

When you leave, auto-rsync changes to your image server and terminal reboots. Server rsyncs to backup server.  <em>Smiple.</em>\r\n\r\nFor that matter, with pgpkeys.net, who needs the fob?  Authenticate yourself to the terminal, it authenticates you via online pgpkey, slurps down your OS image after authenticating with your image server ..."
