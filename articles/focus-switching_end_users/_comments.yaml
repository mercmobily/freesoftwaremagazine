In many case software was developed inhouse, and later sold as an added extra for the company. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo why aren't we seeing efforts to port to Linux, or even see members of the Linux community develop some of this vertical software.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nActually Webber, makers of that famous carburetta, has a free CAD offering, and an intelligent non free 3D CAM add on, but this is not the same as OSS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI know that there are a lot of other applications that fit in this problem domain, and until OSS can supply them, Linux will find it difficult to penetrate many small business of this size. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn my country, Australia, it is estimated that 80% of all businesses are 50 people or less. So FOSS won't work if you have to support two OSes, even if Linux is better.\r\n\r\n<hr/>\r\n\r\n<strong>From</strong>: david  <b>(SUBSCRIBER!)</b>\r\n<strong>Url</strong>: \r\n<strong>Date</strong>: 2005-09-15\r\n<strong>Subject:</strong> Re: excellent review\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is an excellent review, but it would be nice if it can add some more software replacement for Email servers, Enterprise Instant Messaging servers, help desk applications.  We are currently using communcation software from Akeni Enteprise IM, but it would be nice to integrate free customer support modules.\r\n\r\n<hr/>\r\n\r\n<strong>From</strong>: Glen -new reader- \r\n<strong>Url</strong>: \r\n<strong>Date</strong>: 2005-10-09\r\n<strong>Subject:</strong> Broken link? ... sorry\r\n\r\n\r\nI tried to follow the link to Fedora Core and it went nowhere. Shouldn't http://fedora.readhat.com/ actually be http://fedora.redhat.com/ ? That link worked, but they were shut down for site maintenance when the page opened ...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGood article, otherwise, and I love the magazine!\r\n\r\n<hr/>\r\n\r\n<strong>From</strong>: Tony Mobily \r\n<strong>Url</strong>: http://www.freesoftwaremagazine.com\r\n<strong>Date</strong>: 2005-10-10\r\n<strong>Subject:</strong> You are right!\r\n\r\n\r\nHello,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou are completely right  - we fixed the link!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMerc.\r\n\r\n<hr/>\r\n"
