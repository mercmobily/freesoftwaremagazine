His moral code is obviously so far removed from the mainstream that he must have no idea of what the American Public thinks. And that simply put - why even bother trying to get him to understand.\r\n\r\n\tWhen a person is blind - they are blind.

There were too many opinionated questions that were open to debunking and someone as smart as Mr. Kircaali did exactly that. Instead, I wised the interviewer had concentrated on the unquestionably unethical behavior (if any) that MOG displayed.\r\n\r\n\tAs for the DoS attacks on their website, I must say that I condemn such actions. Retaliation isn't the best response and should only be resorted to when all means to keep a perpetrator from repeating an offense has been taken. There are many means a person on the Internet could do this that are all legal.\r\n\r\n\tPerhaps instead of DoS'ing their site, people should just show Fuat Kircaali exactly what they found offensive in the papers' actions. Simply gathering as much private information about the CEO and his family and publishing them on blogs all over the Internet should be sufficient reason. At least there'd be a reason to doing so (conveying an idea) as opposed to MOG's action of mentioning such irrelevant information as her religion.\r\n\r\n\tIf people can find out as much private information about Mr. Kircaali through legal means, perhaps we can convince him that merely being truthful is insufficient to publish information. I mean, if people published his credit card numbers, that would still be considered factual and accurate, but should they?\r\n\r\n_______________________________________________________\r\n\r\n\t\tFrom: Larry Vance\r\n\t\tUrl:\r\n\t\tDate: 2005-05-15\r\n\t\tSubject: Fuat Kircaali shows no ethical standards as SYS-CON exec\r\n\r\n\t\tFuat has demonstrated to me that he does not know what the word ethical means.

Really? Maybe just a million outraged readers?\r\n\r\n\t\tI know Mr. Kircaali CALLS it a DoS attack, but was it really? Or was it instead the effect of people talking about what they felt was an attack of the personal life and religious views of someone they admire and respect, and in disbelief, going to see the site to prove to themselves that anyone would do that? I know that I went out to the site because I couldn't believe that any \"journalist\" would find Ms. Jones personal life, house, or religion at all worthy of writing about -- either her articles on Groklaw are factual or not, what does the neighborhood Ms. Jones lives in have anything to do with it? I thought surely someone had made up a hoax -- why would Ms. O'Gara think that article was worth writing? Surely other people went there en-masse with the same thought -- confirming that this article was not only written, but actually published on a commercial site? I was shocked to find out that indeed it was true.\r\n\r\n\t\tI find it likely that this so-called \"attack\" was just \"the /. (and freesoftwaremagazine.com, and groklaw, etc.) effect?\" I've heard the /. effect called a DDoS before -- it's just a large number of people suddenly interested in the exact same content from the same servers at the same time. Sure, it has the effect of denying service to SOME people seeking the content, but a) that's not an \"attack\" -- it's just the result of being unprepared, and b) it's not some sinister conspiracy by the underground free software movement terrorists, and c) it's the natural result of putting something that everyone is interested in (in a good OR bad way) on your website. Unfortunately, this was something that people were outraged about, and those people (upon confirming the site DID INDEED have this string of ad hominem attacks against Ms. Jones on it) decided to not only ignore the advertisements, but to actively start boycotts against LinuxWorld supporters, well -- then it's an \"attack\" claims Mr. Kircaali. I'm sure if each of the people who actually read the content bought something from the site sponsors, Mr. Kircaali would NOT be calling it an \"attack\", he'd be too busy turning down new sponsors. So this \"attack\" is likely no more than Mr. Kircaali chosing his content in a manner that drives people to his website (good) but then away from his sponsors (bad). Sounds like a self inflicted wound.\r\n\r\n_______________________________________________________\r\n\r\n\tFrom: Gene Heskett\r\n\tUrl: na\r\n\tDate: 2005-05-15\r\n\tSubject: Fuat Kircaali interview\r\n\r\n\tHere I am, 70 years old, and somewhat of a linux user.\r\n\r\n\tMs. OGara's opinions are well known, and its often surmised that there must be a connection, a plant if you will, for an M$ proponent.

I suspect he just got a good hard slashdotting.\r\n\r\n\tI know that groklaw.net itself was unreachable during part of the time, or had response times measurable in geological terms, and PJ discovered the upper limit to her software's comment capacity the hard way. The first Slashdot story got around 500 comments of its own. Sites all over the net picked it up. Combine the Slashdot effect, the Groklaw effect, and the Google News effect, throw in a few tech blogs, and top with all the people emailing everyone they know to go take a look, and you don't need a DOS attack to take down a site. A million or so curious and/or outraged people who want to see the goods for themselves will do a more than adequate job of hammering the server.\r\n\r\n\tOf course, it's much better for his purposes to make like a martyr and claim that a DDOS attack took them down, rather than a bunch of looky-loos who wanted to see what all the fuss was about.\r\n\r\n\tAs for the people contacting his advertisers: It happens all the time. People complain to advertisers on TV shows that they find offensive, in magazines they don't like, in any medium that they disagree with politically. That's the risk any advertiser takes, and when they decide that advertising on the Howard Stern Show, or Fox News, or Sys-Con, is alienating more customers than it's attracting, they'll advertise somewhere else.\r\n\r\n_______________________________________________________\r\n\r\nFrom: Fred Grott\r\nUrl: http://www.jroller.com/page/shareme/Weblog\r\nDate: 2005-05-15\r\nSubject: Sys-Con or SYSCON CONING ALL THE TIME\r\n\r\nFuat\r\n\r\ndrop the bullshit you pulled the articles becuase of being legally liable for Maureen;s actions..\r\n\r\nCompared this to the recent minor absence of traceable sources and quatoes in Wried articles you really stink up the room with that bone head of expplanation..\r\n\r\nPlease understadn the person identified in the article was not PJones now than mr Fuat Kircaali are you going to apollogize to this person or doe sit take a lawsuit to get you be accountable?\r\n\r\nIn most courts in the USa its considered harrassment of publishing personal detials without permission..\r\n\r\nDid you get permission from the individual whoise pheon number and addddress was publsihed by SYS-con by Maurren acting as a Sys-Con editor?\r\n\r\nBTW, did sys-con turn over logs of the alledgfe DDOS attacks over to the FBI?\r\n\r\nPS Even I as a humble blogger cannot post Fuat's home phone numb er and address withotu his persmission internet or in aprint article what makes Fuat think he is immune form that rule?\r\n\r\n\r\n_______________________________________________________\r\n\r\n\tFrom: DMF\r\n\tUrl:\r\n\tDate: 2005-05-15\r\n\tSubject: Good point!\r\n\r\n\tA very good point. Several actually.\r\n\r\n\tThere are so many levels on which FK does not \"get it\", it's hard to know where to begin. Some observations:\r\n\r\n\t1) FK's \"ethics\" are strictly situational. He pulled MoG's articles only due to public outcry. He says several times that he approved - and still does approve - their content.\r\n\r\n\t2) He denies that he \"fired\" MoG; she doesn't work for him. He never says in the interview that he severed whatever business relationship they have.\r\n\r\n\t3) There never was a DDOS attack, only a high volume (which for all that never inconvenienced my access to Sys-Con's sites even during the height of the supposed attack). If FK doesn't know the difference he's not qualified to be a web publisher.\r\n\r\n\t4) FK redefines terms between paragraphs - sometimes between sentences. PJ is a blogger (but not a journalist) when it suits him, and vice versa. Bloggers are different because they can do \"anything they want\", but then defines his own supposed 'journalistic' mandate in mcuh the same terms when it suits him. All his positions are founded on a POV convenient to the situation, with nary a principle in sight.\r\n\r\n\t5) For FK, the only unethical act is an one that comes between him and a dollar. The only ethical act is one that brings that dollar closer to him.\r\n\r\n\t6) I remarked several times while reading the interview how like SCO-think is FK-think. Now we see where the sympathy comes from. Yes, Ralph Yarro has minions.\r\n\r\n\r\n_______________________________________________________\r\n\r\n\t\tFrom: DMF\r\n\t\tUrl:\r\n\t\tDate: 2005-05-16\r\n\t\tSubject: Oops\r\n\r\n\t\tThis was supposed to be a reply to BL's, the next top-level post below, citing the code of journalistic ethics.\r\n\r\n_______________________________________________________\r\n\r\nFrom: BL\r\nUrl:\r\nDate: 2005-05-15\r\nSubject: The fundamental question\r\n\r\nMr. Kircaali proved very adept at avoiding the central fundamental question, namely: \"why is an 'article' about Pamela Jones considered newsworthy in a Linux Business magazine?\"\r\n\r\nThe veracity of the article isn't the point. Let's presume for the point of argument that the facts mentioned are 100% accurate. What legitimate news purpose does the article serve? And I would add a related follow-up question: is the article consistent with the Society of Professional Journalists' Code of Ethics (SPJCE)? ( see http://www.spj.org/ethics_code.asp )\r\n\r\nI believe that the reason Mr. Kircaali avoided these questions is because he wished to spare himself having to choke on the answers, which are:\r\n\r\n(1) Even if the article were entirely factual, a recitation of facts is not news. The article serves no legitimate newsworthy purpose, especially for a Linux Business Journal.\r\n\r\n(2) The article clearly violates so many clauses of the SPJCE that limited space here forbears listing them all. Since SYS-CON and Ms. O'Gara purport to be journalists, this is a reasonable standard to hold their work to. Using that standard, the article is unethical.\r\n\r\n_______________________________________________________\r\n\r\n\tFrom: Rafael Diaz\r\n\tUrl:\r\n\tDate: 2005-05-16\r\n\tSubject: Excellent Points\r\n\r\n\tAs a systems admin and for the little its worth I will never again spend a minute of my time in any enterprise that is in any way related to SYS-CON.

He's appears not to appreciate why many people found MOG's piece so creppy and offensive, which is bad, but even worse he's publicly admitting that the people who launched a DoS attack against his site were effective in doing so.\r\n\r\n\tI don't see how that will do anything but encourage more attacks.\r\n\r\n\tAnother mistake he made is to attempt to lump together people who complained about MOG's article, people who are actively promoting F/OSS & Linux, and the people who launched the DoS attack against him.\r\n\r\n\tUndoubtedly the groups share many members, but they're not the same group. Surely the founder of \"the worldÃ¯Â¿Â½s leading i-technology magazine publisher\" should realzie that.\r\n\r\n\tMr. Kircaali might have come across in a better light if he has cited some of the NON anonymous emails he received complaining about the tone and content if the article as being the main reason he pulled the article.\r\n\r\n\tOr maybe some general sense of common decency.\r\n\r\n_______________________________________________________\r\n\r\n\t\tFrom: Mike Pinto\r\n\t\tUrl: none\r\n\t\tDate: 2005-05-15\r\n\t\tSubject: Interview with Fuat Kircaali\r\n\r\n\t\tI don't think there was a DoS attack, and using this as an \"excuse\" to pull the article was just that, an excuse. If anything, he got slashdotted by an overwhelming number of people who wanted to see just what type of yellow journalism MOG had written. But rather than say that their servers weren't up to the unanticipated load, it sounds so much better to spin it as a DoS (personally, I never had any trouble connecting during the timeframe he claims they were D0S'ed).\r\n\r\n\t\tRather than do the right thing (as most people would do)and admit that he made a mistake by allowing the article to be published, and then apologising, he's trying to somehow justify it. This is amazing to me, because I've already read several editorials on other sites, all of them condeming the article. And these condemnations come from other journalists. And yet, Kircaali refuses to admit that it might have been a mistake to publish this trash. He should be in politics for his ability to talk all around a question without answering it, not to mention being able to somehow portray himself as the victim in all of this.\r\n\r\n\t\tHe calls SYS-CON \"the worldÃ¯Â¿Â½s leading i-technology media company.\" I doubt this was ever true, but if it ever was, I feel sure that after this debacle, it's a thing of the past.

Several have suggested that she should seek a qualified legal opinion before submitting them. More importantly, several asked for Sys-Con to exercise good faith and get an opinion. Sys-Con failed to exercise responsible editorial control. And now, after failing completely to address the problem, Mrs. O'Gara crossed ethical lines.\r\n\r\nThis isn't about O'Gara vs Jones, this is about ethical writing and practices. Looking at the code of journalistic ethics taught at my university, only one of the two authors comes close. And it isn't Mrs. O'Gara. Further, I can tell you that our legal counsel finds the majority of Mrs. Jone's articles to be factual, despite her FOSS commentary. I can't say that any article of Mrs. O'Gara's has had that response. If anything, her efforts have focused attention on the problem of media ethics, paid authorship, and the increased lack of civic responsibility by journalists of all types.\r\n\r\nThe entire tone of Mr. Kircaali's response is that he finds Mrs. O'Gara's articles to be satirical humour. So it's logical I should find Sys-Con and it's publications to be nothing more than unfactual satire not to be taken into consideration when making purchasing decisions.

Not only has he failed to read a single article on Groklaw, I suspect he has only read O'Gara's hatchet job after the fact, and is trying to justify his manifest failure in hindsight. He cares only for his advertising revenue, as he makes plain in the article. His `customers' are not the readership, but those who chose to advertise via this outlet. He would do well to remember that those advertisers will go elsewhere if the readership is offended (and disgusted).\r\n\r\nVicious, irrelevant, inaccurate, spiteful ad-hominem attacks are not journalism. They are clearly the product of a diseased mind, to wit one Maureen O'Gara. She will sink without trace, as should this grubby little tabloid.

Reputable reporters/journalists will not even give out personal information of \"suspected\" criminals. It is as I understand it, a very basic/core part of the journalistic code of ethics. And yet we can't afford this comfort to an \"innocent\" person. Someone who has so publically wished to remain anonymous? Especially in light that this is in relation to one of the most controvercial storries to ever hit the linux world?! To me this sets off red lights and klaxons all over the place. Aaaaaaaooooooga! Aaaaaaaooooooga!\r\n\r\nI will make the assumption that Faut is not a stupid person by virtue of his employed post. I could be wrong. But I don't think so. Ms. O'Gara's stories were obviously biased and by virtue of this bias atracted alot of visitors. More visitors mean more ad revenue. Which in turn means more profit. And profit is what commecial entities are all about. Faut was more than happy to let O'Gara say what ever she wanted as long as visitors came. That is untill there started to be some nasty reprocussions. We will call this an example of \"virtual rubberneckers\" syndrome. Everyone likes to look at small auto accidents. Thinking how stupid the person must have been or simply \"I wonder how it happened?\". But if an accident is big enough or a particular intersection is dangerous enough public outcry will arrise. Demanding change etc. Ms. O'Gara's stories both by their number and seriousness envoke both conditions for outcry. Simply put O'Gara is an accident waiting to happen. A living, breathing, walking, paid disaster zone.\r\n\r\nFaut was more than happy to push the envelope of both truth and ethics on O'Gara's behalf to get more visitors to his site. He under-estimated on that last one and got caught with his pants around his ankles in a \"shit storm\". In short removing the offending story from the site was really the least he could do. And his half hearted apology hiding behind the verracity of so called facts is more or less offensive in itself. One baby step forward one big step back. My future reading of any sys-con published site is still very much in question. When I go to a \"business\" site I want factual, accurate, concise, and most of all relevant analysis. O'Gara is anything but!

If that were the case I could track you down and say some snide or seemingly slanderous remarks at your expense along with providing information on your private life. If you were to sick the lawyers on me I could alwyas just pull the coppout \"Hey it was just news! Stop oppressing my 1st amendment rights!\". That is rather what this whole case is like.

What part of who PJ is changes any of those facts? Are any of those facts religeously significant? If you take away all the legal filings etc from groklaw what do you have? Not much.

I would edit the HTML file as text and then upload it to the server all manually. If someone wanted to leave a comment they could email it to me and if I wished I could tack it on manually later as well. The only difference today is that it has all been simplified and automated. And today it is as it was over a decade ago totally uncalled for to publish private information of a private individual just because they put up a geocities etc page you don't agree with. It is not kosher for the average joe and much less so for a \"professional\" reporter/publisher.\r\n\r\n_______________________________________________________\r\n\r\nFrom: Jason\r\nUrl:\r\nDate: 2005-05-15\r\nSubject: 'American citizen'???\r\n\r\nWith a name like that, he surely is 'american'!

Hope all those emails were anonymous!\r\n\r\nGiving in to terrorism is a mistake, and I see lots of Maureen O'Gara articles are posted at the SYS-CON web site. So, I guess their termination of the relationship that was \"reported\" didn't really happen.\r\n\r\nThere are two real issues here. One is that \"anonymous\" news generally isn't worth anything - it is too easy to display a total disregard for the truth when there are no consequences. Alternatively, a non-anonymous publisher has a lot to lose. While Paula Jones articles may be factual and true, trying (or succeeding) to hide one's identity degrades whatever credibility he or she might have. And, it fails to open the door to disclosing what possible conflicts of interest may exist.\r\n\r\nThe second issue here is that at some point *any* publisher or journalist becomes a public figure. Public figures in American society don't get much in the way of privacy - check out Barbara Strisand and Sean Penn for examples. Is Paula Jones a public figure? Maybe.\r\n\r\n_______________________________________________________\r\n\r\n\tFrom: Anonymous Coward\r\n\tUrl:\r\n\tDate: 2005-05-15\r\n\tSubject: You're wrong on two counts\r\n\r\n\t1. Contacting the advertisers in a publication, TV show, or any other medium, is not actionable. If it was, then every radical right and loony left group in the country would be up on charges. Many of them go much farther than telling advertisers that they are displeased with the media they are advertising in. They organize boycotts. The picket their places of business. They make speeches on their soapboxes or in their pulpits or on their radio or TV shows. There is still some shred of the right to free speech left in this country, and telling someone that you won't buy their product because you don't like where they advertise falls under that.\r\n\r\n\t2. Groklaw is not about anonymous news. Groklaw is about making public (and understandable) the truckloads of paperwork that have come out of the IBM/SCO case. If Pamela (not Paula) Jones was fabricating that material, the way \"real\" journalists with names like Mike Barnacle and Jayson Blair and Stephen Glass did, then totally destroying her credibility would be a simple matter of posting the real documents on SCO's own site and pointing out the discrepancies. This has not happened. Groklaw isn't a news site in the sense that it seeks out news on its own. It's a fact site, a repository of all those legal documents and some comments on their meaning, and a lot of discussion of them by various visitors. The facts are a matter of public record and have never been challenged. PJ's opinions, and those of the people discussing the articles, are clearly just that, opinion, and are worth exactly whatever value you choose to put on them. But it's not about anyone's opinions. It's about the facts.\r\n\r\n_______________________________________________________\r\n\r\n\tFrom: Neo Neko\r\n\tUrl:\r\n\tDate: 2005-05-15\r\n\tSubject: Conflict of interest\r\n\r\n\tThe only possible conflict of interests are the small and rare bits of real oppinion she puts up with the factual documents.

I don't suppose you'd happen to have Rupert Murdoch's phone number to hand? I've got one for News International, but I can never get past his secretary...\r\n\r\n\tLest anyone take me seriously here, let me state that I have no iterest in contacting the proprietor of News International. Still, I expect that anyone pulishing his personal phone number without permission might face all sorts of interesting responses. If the information included details of the Great Man's family in a context of intimidation, well I expect that would turn out to be illegal for all sorts of reasons.\r\n\r\n\tHowever if we accept the notion that a publisher or journalist is a public figure (arguable) and that therefore their contact details should be freely available (far less so) then why Mr. Murdoch's personal phone number not freely avaiable? The answer is, of course, that Murdoch chooses to mediate his contact with the outside world through his organisation and carefully controls the channels that can be used to communicate with him. Wisely so.\r\n\r\n\tSo how is this different from PJ? It isn't that she's \"anonymous\". I as much about who PJ is as well as I do about Maureen O'Gara, rather more if I'd cared to read the article that started this furore. She is also contactable, via email and via Groklaw.\r\n\r\n\tOne reason we look down on anonymous reportage is that it is irresponsable - it the literal sense of \"unable to respond\". If you have a problem with an anonymous publication. there is no way to contact the author or publisher to air your grievance, and no way for either of them to address your issue, since they may well not know of it. A second is that some unscrupulous writers will use anonymity as a shield when writing libel. The third is that for an anonymous author, there is no way to gague the presence of a hidden agenda.\r\n\r\n\tIn PJ's case, she has demonstrated her willingness to respond to criticism. Groklaw is about maintaing a factual record. I have never heard of any error being found groklaw that was not quickly corrected. In the second case, PJ would not seem libelous. If she were, then we could expect the famously litigous and publicity-seeking SCO to have taken action against her, and to have trumpetted the fact to the media. Nor do I believe that SCO needed MOG to find PJ's contact details.\r\n\r\n\tAs for a hidden agenda, PJ's agenda could not be more open. She supports FOSS and opposes FUD. She does both by publishing a factual database useful in fighting off legal challenges to open source software.\r\n\r\n\tAnd that, really, is what the debate should be about, IMO. We should judge PJs journalism (blogging if you must) by the quality of her data. Indeed, this should be the acid test for any sort of reportage, from peer reviewed papers in dead tree journals to anonymous posts on USENET.\r\n\r\n\tTo try and cast doubt on PJ's work by discussing her personal circumstances is at the end of the day, just another ad hominem attack. This one at least is courteous in tone and lacks the elements of intrustion and intimidation. All the same, in the end it boils down the same thing.\r\n\r\n_______________________________________________________\r\n\r\nFrom: Richard Steven Hack\r\nUrl:\r\nDate: 2005-05-15\r\nSubject: He Says Contact Information Is Available For Every Employee\r\n\r\nI TRIED contacting their editorial department from their Web site contact page.\r\n\r\nThe link bombed with an error message - in IE and FireFox.

A slashdotting is what, maybe a 1Gig peak, if that? It runs for a day or two, with peaks and troughs, slowly diminishing. Most sites that are set up for heavy traffic can take it, although they will be stressed, and maybe inaccessible for a few minutes here and there. If they're on serious hosting (and surely sys-con is) then it's a matter of server strain, not of pipes being filled to overflowing. A real DDOS, on the other hand, would probably be 3gig or better, and it doesn't just strain the servers - it's aimed to fill the pipes completely so that traffic is blocked.\r\n\r\n\tNow I, and many others, found sys-con sites up and available throughout the time of the claimed DDOS. I'm not certain they ever were inaccessible, but let's assume they were. It clearly was only briefly. For the vast majority of the period they were accessible to many. So, if it was a DDOS, it wasn't a very good one. But if it was just a slashdotting, the symptoms fit perfectly.\r\n\r\n\tAt any rate, if Mr. Kircaali believes there was a DDOS of his site, he should have evidence of it. The claim that he terminated MoG because of criminal acts by third parties is ludicrous. Were it true, it would be an incredibly bad business decision, very likely actionable, and certainly nothing a man of his astuteness would be admitting in public.\r\n\r\n\tAt any rate, beyond all that, other parts of this interview make it absolutely clear that he has not the slightest understanding of Linux or Free Software or the people that make it work. He's revealed as utterly incompetent for his position. He should resign, and find a position where he's not entirely out of his depth.\r\n\r\n\r\n_______________________________________________________\r\n\r\nFrom: Richard Steven Hack\r\nUrl:\r\nDate: 2005-05-15\r\nSubject: Another Question For This Guy\r\n\r\nHow is it that his company is running ads for OSS companies like SugarCRM next to these sorts of anti-OSS articles from an SCO shill when the company involved, SugarCRM, has NO KNOWLEDGE that their ad was placed there, as their contract was only for ads in LinuxWorld, not Linux Business News?\r\n\r\nOr is Sys-Con in the business of inflating hit counts on ads without the knowledge of their advertisers so they can sell more ad space?\r\n\r\nPersonally I think a denial of service attack was exactly the correct response to this clown and his operation - that's assuming such a thing actually took place (I suspect he's lying through his teeth about that - nothing was mentioned in the press that I am aware about it.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_______________________________________________________\r\n\r\nFrom: Maud Harald\r\nUrl:\r\nDate: 2005-05-15\r\nSubject: Case number?

The simple truth might be that his niche web site is rather low-speced, and they were surprised by the traffic peek caused by his disgusting piece of \"journalism\".\r\n\r\nHe is now running a smear campaign, trying to paint his critics as wackos, trying to paint PJ as someone associated with wackos amd painting himself as a victim of wackos. This is really sad.\r\n\r\nLets make this absolutely clear here:\r\n\r\nPJ is the victim, not SYS-CON, not Mr. Kircaali, not the MOG. Should PJ be harmed by the whole scandal in any way, then Mr. Kircaali is an accessory in this - maybe not in a legal sense, but in a moral sense.\r\n\r\nNo spin doctoring of SYS-CON or Mr. Kircaali can change this fact.\r\n\r\nMr. Kircaali seems to be rather fond of the MOG, and it sounded as he took PJ's rejection to do the TV interview personal. He also doesn't seem to like bloggers, because this is not journalism in his book (we have seen what constitutes journalism in his book). Could these things have clouded his judgement?\r\n\r\nWhat we have seen is that one thing really works: Hitting people like Mr. Kircaali in the wallet. Contacting the advertisers seems to be the thing which made Mr. Kircaali really worried. Whatever Mr. Kircaali ethics and journalistic standards are, his love of money seems to be greater. I suspect money is the only driving fource behind the SYS-CON scandal.\r\n\r\n_______________________________________________________\r\n\r\n\tFrom: Robert Lazarski\r\n\tUrl: www.braziloutsource.com\r\n\tDate: 2005-05-15\r\n\tSubject: clue by four\r\n\r\n\tI read the nytimes, washingtonpost and several other top newspapers pratically everyday.

That is not denying your rights. That is just you publishing sensational personal attacks instead of real news, and getting burned. The first ammendment doesn't guarantee that people won't be outraged and turn away from garbage content, it doesn't guarantee you that people will subscribe to your increasingly tabloid-like content, it doesn't guarantee that those that visit your site will not contact your sponsors and notify them of a boycott. The first ammendment just says that the government won't stop you from publishing it. Your good sense is supposed to stop you from doing that.\r\n\r\nIn the slim homes that someone will bother to read your publication in the future, you will find it more useful to stick to attacking the factual material on Groklaw. Surely you have the resources to have someone investigate THAT instead of the living conditions, mode of transportation, or religious beliefs of the editor. Eventually the public may forgive you, and again turn to your site for news.\r\n\r\nGood luck, sir.\"\r\n\r\n_______________________________________________________\r\n\r\nFrom: Jason J.\r\nUrl:\r\nDate: 2005-05-15\r\nSubject: Maureen o'gara address and phone\r\n\r\nI'm sure she won't mind, since it's, again, all in White Pages:\r\n\r\n[REMOVED]\r\n\r\nI'm sure she will be delighted to hear from the readers.\r\n\r\n_______________________________________________________\r\n\r\n\tFrom: Tony Mobily\r\n\tUrl: http://www.mobily.com\r\n\tDate: 2005-05-15\r\n\tSubject: RE: Maureen o'gara address and phone\r\n\r\n\tHi,\r\n\r\n\t>I'm sure she won't mind, since it's, again, all in White\r\n\r\n\t>Pages:\r\n\r\n\t>Maureen Ogara\r\n\r\n\t>XXXXX\r\n\r\n\t>XXXXX NY XXXXX-XXXX\r\n\r\n\t>(XXX) XXX-XXXX\r\n\r\n\t>I'm sure she will be delighted to hear from the readers.\r\n\r\n\tNO, no, no.\r\n\r\n\tHow can we compnain about ethics if then we break the most basic basic ethics rules?\r\n\r\n\tMerc.\r\n\r\n_______________________________________________________\r\n\r\n\t\tFrom: Jason J.\r\n\t\tUrl:\r\n\t\tDate: 2005-05-15\r\n\t\tSubject: Ethics...\r\n\r\n\t\tWell, first of all that's publicly available on White Pages: [REMOVED]\r\n\r\n\t\tSecond of all, I don't bash her, I simply quote the White Pages.

It contained nothing germane to the issue of Groklaw's accuracy as a news site, nothing germane to the Linux community, nothing germane to the lawsuits SCO is embroiled in.\r\n\r\nHad O'Gara actually discovered a BMW in the drive with a big red ribbon and a note saying \"Thanks from IBM\", that would have been news. However, when a writer starts by calling the subject of the article an \"elusive harridan\", sneeringly comments on the subject's neighborhood and decor, and continues by posting irrelevant information about the contents of what might or might not have been the subjects vehicle ... that's not news. It was malicious, petty, rude, thoughtless, and quite probably a career-ending move for Ms. O'gara. She has conclusively shown that she is not a journalist, she's several grades below a writer for the National Enquirer.\r\n\r\nYour inability to see why it should not have been published calls your professional judgement into question ... if you think what O'Gara wrote about PJ was news, I can't trust that your magazines or websites will publish news.\r\n\r\nIf you truly think there was no damage done, that PJ is being hypersensitive about the disclosures - I challenge you to post the street addresses and towns of your own family on the web, with pictures of the entrances and buildings, and mention the make and color of their cars while you are at it.\r\n\r\nTsu Dho Nimh (yup, I use a pseudonym on the net)\r\n\r\n_______________________________________________________\r\n\r\nFrom: Gerard ter Beke\r\nUrl:\r\nDate: 2005-05-15\r\nSubject: Snake\r\n\r\nSo, Mr. Kircaali apologizes.

While I will personally not be browsing his tabloids in the near future (based upon the lack of quality in recent content), I am sure that the word would get out quickly that he has clearly and unambiguously apologized for his earlier stance. Let me know when that URL is available. Until then, I hope you will understand why I take any claims that he has suddenly come down with a case of concience as unsubstantiated rumor. He might like to try telling his (now partially absent) LinuxWorld editorial staff. They seem to think he either has ethical shortcomings himself, or that he employs and supports those with ethical shortcomings (one might see that as an ethical shortcoming in and of itself), and it has driven a number of them to resign. I feel pretty confident that they must have discussed the problems with him before quitting, so I find it hard to believe he was ill-informed. Since they all worked there for a while and presumably got to know the man, I suspect it to be more likely that the set screw in his ethical compass is loose, and the arrow points which ever way is most convenient for him. It seemed OK to publish Ms. O'Gara's article full of ad hominem attacks until the consequences became clear (loss of sponsors, loss of revenue). Quick fix: tap the compass on the side and voila!\r\n\r\n_______________________________________________________\r\n\r\n\t\tFrom: anonymous, i hope\r\n\t\tUrl:\r\n\t\tDate: 2005-05-16\r\n\t\tSubject: just wanted to say ...\r\n\r\n\t\t...

Even more so when it appears that he is loosing or stands to loose his business due to advertisers potentially abandonning him in droves.\r\n\r\ni.e. It becomes impossible to avoid questioning his sincerity.\r\n\r\nI read the interview when it was first posted.\r\n\r\nHis about face and apology mean absolutely nothing because his own prior quotes and actions ruin any reputation he may have enjoyed for personal integrity.\r\n\r\nAs others have pointed out, how do you make right the injury the third parties in Mureen O'Gara's piece of yellow journalism have suffered? These people lives have been invaded by someone completely lacking in any ethics at all. Give them an apology? Sorry for harrassing you by mistake?\r\n\r\nI don't care how sincere Mr Kircaali sounds now. It's people's initial off-the-cuff responses that give the best gauge of their ethics, morals and beliefs.\r\n\r\nWhat's more, this isn't the first time Mr Kircali's been warned about O'Gara's lack of ethics and totally unprofessional approach to journalism.\r\n\r\nMessage to Mr Kircaali:\r\n\r\nI haven't yet complained to any advertiser's about the shoddy quality of reporting and proven lack of ethics regarding Mz. O'Gara. I'm currently collecting info where to write the marketing departments of the advertisers and their respective ad agencies. Rest assured I will be writing letters of complaint and pointing out how the advertisers probably don't want their brands asssociated in any manner with SYS-CON.\r\n\r\nIt is my opnion that you should have done something about O'Gara back in October, 2004 when you first had a chance to. An apology in the face of your business' possible self destructing because of your self evident 'money is more important than ethics' is meaningless.\r\n\r\nI ask you again. How do you make the invasion of privacy and harrassment of the people mentioned in O'Gara's article whole? Saying \"sorry\" _after_ your senior editors have quit and _after_ your readership has started complaining to your advertisers is meaningless. You, and only you, had the repsonsibility to take corrective action last year. You didn't do so then. You didn't do so now until the public ire of your readership forced you to.\r\n\r\n\"Sorry\" is just where you _start_. It doesn't do anything to make things right.\r\n\r\nIf you want to try to sue me for writing the advertisers to complain. Go right ahead.
