    body: "There are tens of thousands of Linux aficionados who will dismiss your article as senseless drivel but there are millions of average computer users who could not agree more!\r\n\r\nThe only problem is they don't read this since they gave up on using a free OS (not on free software entirely).\r\n\r\n\r\nI installed my first Mandrake about 7 years ago, I bought books and I had all the code. Since then I've used Redhat, Vector Linux, Yellow Dog, Ubuntu, Gentoo, Knoppix - you name it I had it installed. I used parted to create and manipulate my partitions, chatted with an IBM developer and even earned a mention in the Credits section!\r\nhttp://tuxmobil.org/sound_linux.html\r\n\r\nAnd after all that ? I still use Windows 95% of my time. I currently use Vector  Linux because it is the only distro that has not fallen apart after I've installed or updated a core library. I've thrown anything at it except for kernel compilation.\r\n\r\nYou could say I've given up - and I would say you're right. Every distro had failed me (read: became unusable) in some way after I began customizing it to my desires:\r\n- partitions\r\n- sound configuration\r\n- window manager updates\r\n- boot loader configuration\r\n- library installations / updates.\r\n\r\nIn a sense I didn't give up on Linux - it gave up on me and in the belief that an average Joe Schmoe could start it and use it without any repercussions.\r\n\r\nWhy all this? Because you have to be a developer to customize Linux - that is why. You have to understand how the computer works - it will never be a blackbox, which is what Windows successfully portrays today.\r\n\r\nSome days I like to be a developer and play with it but most of the time I just want to be an average dude. \r\n\r\nIf I download a new library I want it in binary form, downloaded either with all dependencies (also in binary) because the download process detected they are missing on my system or without them. I do not want to compile it (that is already bad enough) and then get errors because of chain-link of dependencies in a parent-child formation.  I usually give up after 3 hours disgusted because I just wanted to ride a bicycle but before I could do that I had make my own parts and build them together! \r\n\r\nThat is an overkill. The entire set of steps for distribution, code compilation, installation, configuration and updates NEEDS AN OVERHAUL. \r\n\r\nThere should a standard for everything (maybe some committee or something). All the stupid distros instead trying to be different and think different should be a Linux box first, and a distro second. \r\n\r\nGive me SOMETHING that works the same GUARANTEED across the board of all distros. Amen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Is it a problem with the program you want to install not being well written or clearly stating the dependencies? Or is it that your distro doesn't make it easy to get the libraries you need?\r\n\r\nThe only thing I've had to compile from scratch was the Phylip package. It had one dependency hitch, which required the X11 development libraries. Easily installed on Debian, and I'm off to the races. It was actually in the repos as well, but I need the latest version.\r\n\r\nI suspect part of the problem is the new distros that cater to newbies.

    body: "I believe there are two root causes to the difficulty experienced by the author in compiling software from source on a GNU/Linux distribution:\r\n\r\n1) Software developers can choose to make their software compile provided all required dependencies are available or they can go full-out to support building on multiple flavours of GNU/Linux. The former has advantages for software that aims to be cross-platform (by which I mean GNU/Linux, *BSD, MacOS X etc. but not necessarily Windows) the latter serves to make life easier for distribution packagers and those who routinely install from source. Neither approach is bad but the former case might be perceived as better for making software available to a potentially larger audience.\r\n\r\n2) GNU/Linux distributions do different things with their packaging and filesystem placement. Taking the need for dependencies as an example, Debian might split a piece of software 3 ways into separate packages i.e. basic libraries, runtime required or utilities and development headers. You might need 2 or all 3 of these packages to satisfy building of software from source and it's your responsibility to install them.\r\n\r\nI have used several GNU/Linux distributions (Red Hat, Debian, Mandrake, Gentoo and Ubuntu) with at least two years spent with each of them. In almost all cases I have had occasion to install software from source but this was always possible provided the required supporting and development packages for the particular distribution were installed beforehand. Often I had to read the documentation accompanying the source archive to determine which dependencies were required - diving straight into ./configure isn't always the best way to proceed.\r\n\r\nTo cite a recent experience, on Ubuntu, I found it necessary to build two kernel modules from source. These were for a PCI Wireless adapter (RT61STA) and Webcam (gspca). In both cases, Ubuntu provides broken support for the devices I chose to use and building from source was the only way to make them work. This was simply achieved through installing build-essential and   kernel-headers packages. OK, building a kernel module requires less in the way of dependent libraries than your typical software application but the principle is the same.\r\n\r\nThe moral of this is that building from source, under a packaged GNU/Linux distribution, should be undertaken with due care to the requirements of the software being built. This includes determining precisely what dependencies are required, what packages will satisfy them and what, if any, modifications the distribution has made to those dependent packages that might prevent a build from source completing successfully."

As such, I had several successes installing SuSE 32-bit packages on a Mandriva 64-bit system...\r\n\r\n- it helps to find the software's requirements: .configure will usually spell them out to you. If it doesn't, then yes, you can get angry at the author (but then, you should also peruse as much of the README and author notes as you can)\r\n\r\n- it helps to define your library paths: when you're not using the same distribution the developer did, you need to know that stuff like /usr/lib, /usr/share/lib, /usr/local/lib, /usr/lib64 etc. may be different from one distro to the other\r\n\r\n- if you can't find the software for your architecture, you may be forced to compile from sources: say, a i386-optimized software for your AMD64 platform.

Now I know. We have end-users aspiring to do the things you normally leave to professional developers. So why would you freak around with your OS if you don't know the consequences and you are not willing to accept any? \r\n\r\nOut of the box most distros are rock solid. Problems usually occur if you mix in third party software in the base system. Hence don't compile libraries from source and don't use untrusted repositories. Stability issues and dependency hell will ensue.\r\n\r\nIt's funny that when somebody borks his FOSS OS he always brings out the flawed comparison with Windows. \"On Windows this never happens!\" Well, of course it doesn't happen. Windows doesn't really offer options to break the system core (at least since Windows 2000). All external packages are written with only one (or two) Windows versions in mind. The platform is locked down against user tampering and only MS sanctioned updates appear on Windows Update. An end-user is forbidden to mess up the system.\r\n\r\nWith FOSS you are not prohibited from messing up the system. Just because you can compile and you have the freedom to replace core system files on your own, doesn't mean you should though. Not if you don't know and aren't willing to accept the consequences.

I'm a programmer by trade, so it wasn't that great of a leap for me to become acquainted with the lay of the filesystem hierarchy, how the linker works, where the appropriate config files are, and the proper use of make and the GNU auto-tool chain.\r\n\r\nHowever, you want to criticize <em>every Linux distribution you've tried</em> for failing to make things easy enough so that my mother, the average user, can install software from source?!?\r\n\r\nThat's an outlandish claim; show me a single popular program for OS X or XP that is compiled during installation. If you do, I will recant. If you cannot (and I don't believe you can), you need to seriously reconsider being critical of an operating system which gives you the ability to compile from source <em>even if you have to read a manual to do so</em>.\r\n"

    body: "Quite frankly I'm surprised that anyone would even bother to take the time to complain about this. Compiling from source is not easy, and that's precisely the reason that pre-packaged distros exist in the first place.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that rather than saying \"I'm unable to compile this, but I shall learn how\", you've decided to instead attack the very act of compiling rather than appreciate for a moment what people have to do to bring you this so called \"user friendliness\".\r\n\r\nIt reminds me of people who say \"Linux should be..\", if you think Linux should be easier you make/use an easy distro, you don't go on a crusade to change the very core foundation of what 'Linux' is."
