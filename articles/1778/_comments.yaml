Which means You probably don't have the content that I was looking for. Although it looks like you're showing lots of google ads.\r\n\r\nI work exclusively with opensource software, but it is odd that none of my searches ended here. I don't know what it means. But whatever.\r\n\r\nAlso, just looking through your magazine, I saw the GIMP article, and I was like goodie! I can learn how to use GIMP to create a banner. When I checked it out, the author has the beginning picture, a bunch of screenshots, but only TEXT explanations of what is happening to the pic. At the end of the article, on page 3, we are shown the end product. I would've liked to see how the thing looked after each step that the author mentioned. Yeah, I'd see it if I did it myself, but then I'd see everything.. so why bother with half of the screenshots?\r\n\r\nSo, naturally, I wanted to leave a comment, but guess what? I can't? seems like some articles allow comments and others don't.\r\n\r\nWhatever comments I have seen are not that many. Which tells me that users don't find your site interesting enough to stick around or leave comments most of the times. 30,000 users hitting the thing could really bring in lots of cash. If you don't believe me go look at plentyoffish.com . The guy claims to be making half a million bucks a MONTH!!! from google ads. And he has way less useful content than you guys ;-) but his site is sticky.\r\n\r\nSo, why should IBM throw you a bone? its not a charity-fest. I'm sure someone took a long hard look at your site and said, \"it isn't worth it\". meaning they don't think you bring any exposure value to them. It is simple as that.\r\n\r\nIf youtbue asked them to sponsor its site, they'd be all over it (maybe not). but you get my gist.. So, my suggestion?:\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>make your site sticky and worth reading. try not to shove so many ads in ma face!\r\n<li>allow people to participate, and do it consistently\r\n<li>Build a community of readers, get them to edit the content or something\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\nyou can't use the push model just cuz you're free. There are plenty of other \"free\" resources out there, no offense, and unless I am somehow vested in your site, the only way I'd come back here is if google sends me here. otherwise, once I'm done writing this comment, I might be good as gone.\r\n\r\nhave fun and good luck. I'd like to see the rise and fall of Ruby on Rails discussed in your mag if you don't mind :) "

Design by a huge committee is usually a failure - see the example of how Mozilla got no market share until a few people took over and with a hammer fist did Firefox their way, sending the cries of the old guard not to simplify and remove features to /dev/null.  Likewise the huge growth of Ubuntu while Debian plods along.\r\n\r\nAll the mid-sized apps need to survive is a strong, draconian leader.  If your mid-sized app is in trouble, pick a leader NOW and make a structure where coders are coding, not debating or supporting.

It's not that the product sucks or you're a crappy manager.  It's just that a $12,000 market is not ever going to support a $50,000 salary.

If this is so expensive, then you have essentially failed the first test of \"free\" software. Apparently, free software is not so free after all??\r\n\r\nIf that is the case, why should you even bother? If you would still like to bother, then why not structure your site such that most of the content is generated by users. And it is not the first time it would happen. \r\n\r\nYou are trying to be ComputerWorld/InformationWeek of the free world - who exist based on incestual relationships with the corporate world, while \"Free Software Movement\" flies right into the face of that mentality - and you should know this (if you're really plugged into the FS movement). Adoption runs off of the selfish desires of adopters, not the other way around. No one will adopt you just because you want them to, but they will if they feel a need to.\r\n\r\nWhy should someone pay for something which has FREE in its name? So, your only chance of salvation is so many users that the advertisers will feel compelled to buy premium ads. Or, value added articles with community stake in return visits.\r\n\r\nA thought occurs: Are you what a flag bearing magazine of Free Software Movement should be? Perhaps you have only looked at the price, and not at the philosophy of free software, and that may have something to do with the current situation."

Keyword being 'invest' and not 'donate'.\r\n\r\nMy suggestion would be to build statistics of your userbase, page hits and stuff and based on your user profile target business with value add services - maybe a job/applicant match, press releases of new products etc. \r\n\r\nYou are a magazine, you reach people - show case it as a marketing tool for people wanting to reach out to the free software community."

    body: "Hello,\r\n\r\n\"Although i really like your website - there are literally hundreds of others out there with the same news\"\r\n\r\nWe don't do news at all. We have contents. And as far as contents, the only site I can think of with more contents online is <a href=\"http://www.linuxjournal.com\">Linux Journal</a>. I would be surprised if I discovered hundreds of web sites which create content consistently (as we do). Maybe I didn't look hard enough, but if you reply, please list at least say 60 or 70 - since \"hundreds\" implies at least two or three hundred, coming up with 60 or 70 shouldn't be hard.\r\n\r\nGetting laptops is \"in order\" because it's something we need, something we would pay full price for, and something IBM would be able to get them at highly discounted rates. Your reference to cell phones and charge cards is inappropriate. You are probably not aware that being sponsored with hardware is very common in the IT world.\r\n\r\nAs far as being a free software project, I would say that Free Software Magazine is a \"free software related project\" (hopefully you won't challenge that part), which complements free software. Since the letters r-e-l-a-t-e-d are fading from my keyboard, I'll save some keystrokes and write \"Free Software Magazine is a free software project\". I founded it, and that's what *I* consider it to be. Many people share my vision. However, this is a free world - feel free to have a completely different opinion.\r\n"

    body: "You seem to start from the basis that free software projects require some kind of \"world beater\" ambition behind them in order to continue. Thus you've missed the fourth (or should that be first?) kind of free software project. The small one which exists to scratch the author's itch and which the author places into the community purely so that it might help others.\r\n\r\nThese projects often start small and stay small - few hundred users - but they continue their work and are used. They are small enough to slip through the Darwinian net and continue to exist because those who use them seem to find them helpful and useful and fitting to their needs. How do I know? I have written two of them. If you use one of these small projects and haven't yet fed back to the authors then do so or the author may assume nobody else is using it and stop working on it.\r\n\r\nThese projects don't get or deserve fame and fortune and thousands of users. They don't need funding because they are small enough to be managed in the author's spare time. I would say that some of the best free software projects started as one of these simply because the authors believed in the free software licence. There's no idealogy behind the projects, they don't try to change the world just improve a little bit of it or simply just share what they've done with the world in case the world is interested. \r\n\r\nOne I particularly recall was a little kernel project that was started in Finland as \"just a bit of fun\" :o)"

    body: "<cite>IBM can't support everyone - nor should they. IBM stockholders would most likely not enjoy funding all of these profitless projects.</cite>\r\n\r\nAs it happens IBM has a good tradition of supporting causes which do not return on investment. They even have (at least) one guy whose job it is to organise/authorise all this charitable stuff and my understanding is that IBM have a policy to NOT throw money at things but invest resources (staff hours, software etc.). Whilst IBM cannot support everyone I think it's not out of the question for something like FSM to ask for their support and the fact that Tony asked for resourcs and not money is entirely in keeping with my experience of how IBM do their philanthropy.\r\n\r\n<cite>One has to do some serious stretching to make the conclusion your a \"Free Software Project\" - You don't make any software - so your not a \"Software Project\" ... period!\r\nYou provide information on software - your a Software news site.</cite>\r\n\r\nIMHO FSM is fairly unique - perhaps not always in content but certainly in approach and certainly within the publishing industry. I know of no other magazine that limits itself to free software (as opposed to GNU/Linux). I know of few magazines that publish in the same way.\r\n\r\nIs it a free software <em>development</em> project? No. Is it a project relating to, using and promoting free software? Yes. So perhaps Tony's claim that FSM is a free software project has some merit after all - from a certain point of view ( as Obi-Wan said )."

    body: "I agree to your comment outlining the peculiarity of surviving free software projects.  I would like to add another perspective.\r\n\r\nIf we think of the \"real\" free software projects as those little ones manageable within the authors' time and money resources, then perhaps a project that floats itslef to \"compound,\" \"coordinate,\" or \"view over\" those many varied little projects will have a hard time slipping through the \"Darwinian net\" of free software projects.  In fact, this kind of a project would most likely require and consume too many resources it cannot be classified as a free software project anymore.  It would then become a project calling forth disciplines among its organizers, sets of standardized rules and codes, and dedicated time and efforts, among others.  It rings a bell of a government, which calls forth a regime of methodically salaried bureaucrats in order to manage its people's and nation's resources in the most beneficial way to the most of its constituents, or, of a corporation, which employs the same approach and tools towards managing resources (equate \"people,\" \"nation\" and \"constituents\" to \"shareholders\").\r\n\r\nIn other words, a compunding type of project such as FSM, from the above analysis, could mean a birth of an unwanted nemesis whose existence, in competing for resources, would roil an already established structure such as IBM.  From this perspective (and the current paradigm of getting survived), it doesn't take a nuclear scientist at IBM to block support to increasing the chances of the survival of a rival such as FSM.\r\n\r\nFSM's open lamentation on IBM's denial of support may be one of our most trying cases of today's global search of a model of true harmony among coexistences of our fellow human beings, governments and corporations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n.....\r\nI have no bananas and monkeys punch line.\r\n"

And then comes the wish of freedom, of sharing, of learning , teaching , feedback!!, pure and rewarding feedback, and more passion with each one of those practices.\r\n\r\n With respect to the question you wrote as the article's title. I have a really simple and clear answer:\r\n \r\n   All is about the community you create around. The fact here is that you're not pointing only to a geek/hacker/nerd public you're pointing to a more general (and sane :P) public. So it takes a bit longer to see its fruits. I bet this project is gonna grow A LOT, and it's going through the right way.\r\n\r\n BTW, consider spreading more links around, because it still seems the project is hidden in some part of the net.\r\n\r\n--\r\narkaino.\r\n"

I do disagree with some of the statements about this site not being worth it and free software is different than open source. They are just being petty. Probably just jealous of your large userbase.
