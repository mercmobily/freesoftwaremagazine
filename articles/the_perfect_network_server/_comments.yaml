Really useful if you are running testing (or unstable if not on a server).\r\n\r\nI looked at Ubuntu for this but found it added little to the Debian way I was used to.\r\n\r\nSetting up mail can be tricky regardless of how you do it and there is an argument which says that is for good reason. It is made easier by the install guide shown which really comes down to understanding the options shown. This is turn requires a little more understanding of MTAs in general - never a bad thing if you are deploying one. Of course if your server is not serving mail to anyone then you can probably install smail ( <code>apt-get install smail</code> ) which makes it trivial to just forward non-local mail to your SMTP relay of choice.\r\n\r\ncheers\r\nRyan"

Without the need to reference _any_ outside resources. Now and in the future. Forever.</cite>\r\n\r\nIt does not presume that the admin must be 100% completely able to... - that would be foolish. I run servers without GUIs all the time  - always, every day. Never needed a GUI yet.\r\nWhat I do not presume is that the admin needs to be sitting in front of the server to administer it and I should have said this.\r\nI do all my administration via ssh (Secure Shell) with RSA keys. Rarely do I need to sit in front of the server and rarely do I therefore need to access web pages from within it for configuration issues.\r\nShould I need to access _any_ outside resources I do - on the same machine I am connecting from.\r\n\r\n<cite>- no outside connectivity is needed.</cite>\r\nWhy would you need a GUI to connect to or from the outside? We run several remote servers sitting behind firewall devices which permit access via ssh. These servers do not have _any_ GUI installed and they never will have. \r\n\r\nAgain - running a GUI on an this kind of server is a waste of resources. Why use up RAM and processing power keeping a GUI loaded (regardless of it's footprint) when you don't need it. Even having one installed and starting it when required seems a waste when it can be done via command line or web front-end.\r\n\r\n<cite>Better to have it in and solid up front at install time, than in an emergency where (a) you may not have network connectivity to be able to install it, (b) you can never tell if installation is going to impact or change the situation of the current emergency problem.</cite>\r\n\r\na) Why would I need to install it?\r\nb) Installation of the GUI? Then don't install it. If you mean a package update or installation then I suggest you have not used Debian's apt system very much. You are told exactly what will be updated, what will be newly installed and what will be removed. You can even haev it report open bugs for you before you proceed. Not that I'd expect any significant ones in a Debian stable system. SME Server requires full server unavailability when updating the whole distribution by CD.\r\n\r\nI have re-read what you say but I still cannot see how any of this is an argument for needing a GUI - honestly. So far you have not laid out a reason to have a GUI installed other than \"it might come in handy\". Handy for what? Configuration? Troubleshooting? I can do these by command line, remotely and quickly. Please explain what tasks on a server specifically require a GUI.\r\n\r\n<cite>You cannot presume up front that a GUI will never be needed, ever. To do so is just foolhardy. Better to have it there, up front, just in case, so you know when problems arise that it is not part of the problem.</cite>\r\n\r\nI can and do presume it. I do not presume it lightly, however. It is based upon years of doing this without a GUI. I have never ( repeat _never_ ) found myself needing or wanting a GUI when troubleshooting a server. Indeed when the problem is your graphics driver or mouse, becoming dependant upon a GUI will just create a bigger headache. A command-line interface is the lowest common denominator here. \r\n\r\n<cite>Yes, Windows needs it, because not everything is configurable from the command line.</cite>\r\n\r\nOf course Windows needs it - this was my point. A Windows based server will require a GUI and the associated resources to run it. A Free software based server ( running Debian, SME Server, FreeBSD whatever ) does NOT require a GUI. When I said \"Contrary to what certain software companies believe, running a GUI is a waste of resources for a server\", the software company was of course Microsoft. The argument I am making is that just because we are told by Microsoft that a GUI is needed does not mean ALL servers need one. Indeed beyond configuration I would doubt the GUI is needed for a Windows server (that is day to day serving files or mail does not a GUI). Which may explain why I have seen so many with a 17\" monitor switched off and sitting above them. So therefore running a full GUI on a server when you only need it if something goes wrong is a waste of resources.\r\n\r\n<cite>When you're in an emergency / down situation, that is not the time to have to think about how to get in place the resources you need to investigate and examine the problem, before you can actually get to the problem.</cite>\r\n\r\nI agree but I fail to see what this has to do with a GUI. Troubleshooting via log files, command-line feedback etc. is all possible and often more informative than GUI flashing lights and dialog boxes. When a machine is down and I really need to be in front of it I can put a dusty old 14\" CRT monitor on it if I want to and then I can use it. Using a GUI requires additional resources - some of them inside the server some of them plugged into it.\r\n\r\n<cite>Particularly if, as the target audience of this article is, you're a new Linux admin.</cite>\r\n\r\nAgain I agree and again I see no reason for this to result in installing a GUI. SME Server as mentioned in the article has a remotely accessed web interface which enables you to administer your server without touching the command line. For new (by which I take it you mean beginner) Linux admins\r\n I would recommend that but it still does not run a GUI. X is not installed at all.\r\n\r\ncheers\r\nRyan"

But this article is intended for those who have no experience, and have never dealt with such servers. And YOU won't be around for every reader who goes and implements what the article suggests.\r\n\r\nYou are falling into a few traps that I see repeatedly. They are typical of vendors: _I_ know what I'm doing, and _my_ implementation will never change. This is not a shot, just my experience. Inevitably I have had to come along afterwards and blow up (expand) their nice, neat, tidy, installations, because the unexpected has happened, or is suddenly required, and what I'm familiar with, or think I need, to solve a problem, isn't there. From a long term maintenance perspective. Sometimes bringing that install up to 'my standards', including installing things I might not need now, but I sure want in place just in case, breaks things - because the original installer had tunnel vision.\r\n\r\nChange _always_ happens, eventually, and, just as _eventually_ it will be done by someone else.\r\n\r\nThroughout your response you say _I_ this and that. When you get hit by a bus, what about the next guy, who may know nothing?\r\n\r\n> Should I need to access _any_ outside resources I do - on the same machine I am connecting from.\r\n\r\nYou presume you have access to outside resources, to get into the machine in the first place. You also presume that the next emergency problem solver has your level of competence to be able to solve the problem, and that solving the problem won't involve sucking up an external fixit utility to work directly on the problem machine, because that's how the newbie who has to fix it _right now_ knows, or can find, how to deal with it.\r\n\r\nThe article deals with new installations by new people. People who if not actually uncomfortable with the command line, certainly won't have a breadth of knowledge necessary to deal with the problem in the environment you suggest.\r\n\r\n> These servers do not have _any_ GUI installed and they never will have.\r\n\r\nBecause the company has decided to implement things that way, and, more importantly, the company has decided to maintain a staff with the necessary expertise to maintain those installations. This is not whom the article is directed to. Such a company wouldn't even read this article. They are already well beyond it.\r\n\r\n> It is based upon years of doing this without a GUI.\r\n\r\nHardware is cheaper than people. Peace of mind has a cost. I didn't say run X, merely make sure it is there. In a down situation, resource consumption is your last concern, having in place any possible resource you, the new guy, might need, is the first concern.\r\n\r\nThis article is an introduction for new people never having done this before. I don't disagree with your comments in the context of experienced admins., however, how was that experience gained? I would guess, given your comments, in an environment where you had similar machines already, to examine and as a basis of confidence as to how to go forward. I would also guess that you had people around you with expertise to draw upon as you worked to figure things out.\r\n\r\nThe point of the article is for those who have never done such, have nobody around, and have only the web to draw upon. No outside dollars for consultants. Typically, their test machine is their live environment. It has to be solved, _here_, _now_. The article reader doesn't know how - they will have to, at least, browse the web. From that machine.\r\n\r\nI don't say the _next_ machine they do will need it. Only the first one. As their expertise and confidence grows, they will need less and less.\r\n\r\nBut for that first one - hardware is cheap, and software seldom really pushes it to the max. For, at most, a few MB of memory (in this age of GB memory), a few MB of disk space (in this age of TB disks), a few MHz of CPU (in this age of GHz CPU), save yourself some aggravation and irritation up front - put in a GUI. Maybe you'll never need it, for no big loss. But for you, the new user, even if only for a comfort pillow, put it in.\r\n\r\nYou'll be glad you did. This time. Maybe not the next."

It is wise to have a certain understanding of network technologies (even if it's knowing that those technologies exist and what they do). This is why the article is the the Hacker's code section and labelled Intermediate. These people would have maybe used or fiddled with proprietary servers before - or deployed a peer-to-peer desktop PC as a \"server\". Bottom line:  terms like POP, SMTP, DNS etc. would not be foreign to them.\r\n\r\nSecondly, they would be looking to see if their server needs could be fulfilled by Free Software and what types of Free Software server solutions were out there.\r\n\r\nThat gives us our general set of users. Within that I was hoping to address two groups:\r\na) those who had installed GNU/Linux a few times and were familiar with the command line but just had never done a server because it seemed too complex.\r\nb) those who had used GNU/LInux/Free Software at Desktop level and were happy with installing - say - Windows from a CD. They had not installed GNU/Linux from scratch before but understand what partitions, RAM and DNS etc. are.\r\n\r\nThe Debian option was aimed at group a), the SME-server at group b).\r\n\r\n<cite>You still presume network connectivity to be able to run a web client (GUI) on another machine, to read pages from a machine that may not be able to communicate to you.</cite>\r\nYes I do but then so do you if you are expecting to browse the web from the server - as you mentioned. In addition many of the packages used within a server environment are unlikely to have desktop-based help pages. You are more likely to have to wade through.\r\nFinally - have a look at the typical network diagram shown. The Internet connectivity is supplied via an ADSL Modem/Router and not the server. I would expect the server and PCs on the LAN to gain access to the web via that. Granted the server could provide gateway and DNS services but for simplicity in smaller environments I have tended to use router/modems.\r\n\r\nWhile I am here, you have also said this...\r\n\r\n<cite>You are falling into a few traps that I see repeatedly.

Inevitably I have had to come along afterwards and blow up (expand) their nice, neat, tidy, installations, because the unexpected has happened, or is suddenly required, and what I'm familiar with, or think I need, to solve a problem, isn't there.</cite>\r\n\r\nFirstly, by placing expectations of a GUI on the system you are also saying \"your\" implementation is what is \"required\".\r\n\r\nSecondly, there is a reason I use SME-server and Debian.\r\n\r\nSME-server can be administered by people less confident/skilled/experienced than myself with a few simple instructions on how to access it. It really can. I usually deploy this where it is unlikely the organisation is going to be able to (or have the funds to) replace me if I go. Updates, configuration,  administration are all done in the standard recommended way for SME-server. Anyone unfamiliar with it (but familiar with networking and server terminologies/technologies) can quite easily configure an SME-server. If they don't pick it up from the easy-to-follow web interface then they can browse the host of good documentation on the website. Yes this expects a web connection but so does a lot of documentation these days.\r\n\r\nFor the Debian installs I use standard Debian packages, configured in the standard Debian way and locations, If I install Exim4 it is done via apt and the config files are in /etc/exim4 . In this way not only can someone who has configured/administered Debian before carry on where I left off with minimal learning curve, they can also apply package updates knowing that I have done nothing out of the ordinary which the update might break.\r\n\r\nThirdly - when I install a server I make very sure the people there either, have the skills to carry on after me (that I will train people to add users via the SME web interface) or I make sure they are able to acquire the services of someone who can. It is on that basis that I decide which option to roll out.\r\n\r\nCheers\r\nRyan"
