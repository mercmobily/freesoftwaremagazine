    body: "This is really a great series of articles. They're well researched and give a very interesting look into a possible future. Thank you, Terry Hancock!\r\n\r\nI'm generally interested in that what might become a broader movement on how information should be treated in our economy. Free Software, Free Culture, Open Movies, OpenAccess, Free/Open Design... etc. It's all (more or less) about the same. It's the logic which is described in the free-content-books <a href=\"http://www.free-culture.org/freecontent/\">Free Culture</a> and <a href=\"http://www.benkler.org/wealth_of_networks/index.php/Download_PDFs_of_the_book\">The Wealth of Networks</a>. \r\n\r\nFree Design is at the moment sadly the least developped direction, but not less important. As you wrote in your articles, as produced things get more complicated (more information than matter needed to produce it), Free Design should play a more important role."

    body: 'It is needed to know how to manufacture many industrial chemicals and in addition reagent chemicals. The reference works to do this are disappearing from the used book market and are no longer available on the new book market. It is time to put them back both at the pilot plant level (automated) and at the microlaboratory level (manual) along with the designs of unit process equipment. '
