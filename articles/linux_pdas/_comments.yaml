With SDL already ported, PyGame should be a no-brainer, and then it's just a matter of making sure the game design fits the specs on the machine (screen size, joystick capabilities, no mouse or keyboard requirements, etc).\r\n\r\nReaders should also be aware that there is a \"MK2\" GP2X coming out which will double the screen resolution to 720x480 (which is a much more useful spec, IMHO).\r\n\r\n(Nitpick: I think you meant \"no effort is made\" in paragraph 1, \"no effort is spared\" means the exact opposite, of course, as in \"No effort was spared to bring you the best possible X\".)."
