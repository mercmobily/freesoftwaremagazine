    body: "Perhaps you forgot where you are. This the \"Free Software Magazine\". Sorry to sound rude, but your Windows-only demo of a commercial product is not welcome here.\r\n\r\nBesides, I've had pretty bad experiences with \"auto stitchers\" in the past. The ones I've tried always seemed to choose the worst set of points - leaves on trees for example, or the seemingly featureless centre of a wall instead of the corners. I spend so much time weeding out the bad points or adjusting them, that it's often easier to just do it all manually myself."
