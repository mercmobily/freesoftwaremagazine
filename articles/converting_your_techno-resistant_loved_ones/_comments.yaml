Like a moth to a flame.... \"This is heaps cooler than Windows Solitaire, can I have it???\".  Linux installed the next day, and she was regularly rebooting just to play.  That was the hook.  The line was Digikam for her photos which had her staying in Linux for longer.  The sinker was getting all her web-mail accounts downloading into KMail, she's in for life now :-)\r\n\r\nJohn."

My steps were about like those given in the article. The holdout of the household was my wife as well, while the kids breezed onto Linux and loved it. \r\n\r\nI made the only machine in the house that was still running Windows into a dual-booter, showed everybody how to switch between Windows and Red Hat, then gently stood back. This allowed my wife to gradually get familiar with Linux at her own pace, and she now swears by her Firefox in Mandriva running not in Gnome or KDE - but Window Maker!\r\n\r\nWhen I checked the uptime on Linux, and found out it had been running continuously for six months, I asked around one last time and got indifferent shrugs when I asked if we were ready to say goodbye to Windows. We were, and my life has since had 14% more free time, now that I don't have to sit down once a week and scrape malware and viruses out of a computer to get it running again.\r\n\r\nBy all means, get the youngest people in the household onto Linux first. They will convert the older ones for you!"

They complain about \"Linux Geeks\" being obsesive, but they appear to be equally so.\r\n\r\nI agree that Linux enthusiasts can loose their cool sometimes, but this wasn't one of those times, and it has exposed that windows enthusiasts can be equally zealous!\r\n\r\nI also would say before going further that all OSes are made by human beings, andso are not perfect and will crash, and will do funny things, and be difficult to use in one way or another. This includes Windows, Linux, MacOS, BeOs, NextStep, and whatever else. What you prefere out of these imperfect OS's depends on your experiences, values and ideals.\r\n\r\nThe interesting point that this raises in my mind is:\r\nI can understand why people become Linux Evangelists for the simplest of reasons- competition is good,(monopolies are ALWAYS bad for Citizens), therefore increasing awareness of \"fringe\" products to reduce a monopoly and increase awareness of an alternative.\r\nThere are other Ideological arguments: Open source = freedom = choice & can be as robust and functional as proprietary software, blah blah blah.. (sorry, just meant I don't want to use this to stand on my \"soap box\", just I understand the arguments)\r\n\r\nWhat I can't understand is what MS People get so hot about? Why do they care so much about what a fringe of IT Enthusiasts want to put on their (and their family's) boxes? Why are they SOOoo offended by someone sujesting you have a choice, and there are good reasons for exercising that choice in an informed way? Do they have any conceptual or Ideological arguments to disparage Linux, and the call towards Linux? The only points that I hear is that Windows is \"better\" and Linux is S**T and Linux users are A**H***S. Do they even realise they are also being Evangelists? These peeps just come across agressive and closed to any choices or differences and think everyone should be like them, and like what they like, and think how they think...\r\n\r\nplease remember that competition from Linux can also be good for passionate windows users! MS will have to respond to Linux as a serious competitor and up their game, provide better service or offer more \"value for money\". Why would anyone resist a possible change like that?\r\n\r\nsorry for going on (and on)\r\nLook forward to reading your thoughts. (no flames please, I'm British) ;)\r\n\r\nThis post was really meant for the digg site, where alot of peeps appear to be getting HOT about this article, but maybe they'll read it here anyway."

Linux is the flagship of the free software movement. Linux, in representing free software, means so much: \"freedom\", \"openness\", \"community\", \"honesty\", \"trust\", \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-zero-sum_game\">non-zero-sum game</a>ness\". \r\n\r\nIf you try to find other meanings in Windows you find the opposites.\r\n\r\nIt's easy to understand how people can be so enthusiastic about Linux and free software. But, on the flip-side, why do people get so enthusiastic about using an OS that everyone else uses. When I used to use Windows and other proprietary products, I never saw any reason to be enthusiastic about it. What makes people become MS zealots? I just don't get it.\r\n"

Sure, there are people that use Windows (quite a lot of them actually). There are even people who have compared Windows to the alternatives (not so many of them!) and decided that it is still the most appropriate OS for their needs. But I cannot think of one single person (who isn't a Microsoft employee being paid to spout soundbites) who actually <em>likes</em> Windows (as opposed to 'I use it because I need Device A or Program B', which is my situation)"

    body: "Ben Davis wrote: \"What I can't understand is what MS People get so hot about?\"\r\n\r\nHere are a few reasons:\r\n\r\n1.) Richard Stallman and his free software movement wasn't diplomatic from the start. They seem to think all software should follow their definition of software freedom. Note, they do not argue in terms of \"competition == good, monopolies == bad\". Otherwise their conclusions and their methods would be different. They argue that free software is good, and proprietary software is evil. It's not a funny thing to find yourself in the (moral) company of killers and drug dealers, you know? What's worse, they seem to have no valid arguments for their position.\r\n\r\n2.) Users are usually not trained to sell stuff diplomatically. When they started preaching to other people, they sometimes did so in a rude manner. They called Windows users clueless, for example. The attitude spread by Richard Stallman wasn't helpful either. Some Linux users were calling Windows users \"unethical\" and how could they know about the differences between a Linux user and a free software activist? They just attributed impolite behavior to Linux users, and responded in a similar way. As a result, there's a history of not being nice to each other.\r\n\r\n3.) The sales force of a usual company is bad enough, but when your friends and family starts selling stuff, this is sometimes even worse. Did you ever get a call from somebody you know who tried to sell you insurances or other stuff at home? Then you get the idea why most people don't like a certain sort of selling.\r\n\r\nHowever, you may like to check your own view, too: Out of 80 comments on Digg.com right now, only 2 comments from Microsoft users had a negative number of diggs. At least two other comments from Microsoft users were voted up. Given how much Microsoft users are out there, maybe your impression about them getting hot is not quite accurate?\r\n\r\nNote also: The very first comment on the story was a user accusing 90% of Digg users to have no open mind -- is that OK?"

However, free software's strongest form of marketing is word of mouth so those are always going to be problems. \r\n\r\nOn point 1: the free software movement may have been started by RMS but that doesn't make it his. He may be very wise but he is not very charismatic. We need a new leader for free software. I think Mark Shuttleworth may be the one to do it. He's young, pleasant looking, and is far more charismatic."

I finally remembered to check out the latest release changes to Blender that occurred back in June or July and sent him an email about them, remarking, \"pretty damn good for free, don't you think?\"  Eric's reply consisted of a lot of \"Wow\"s and a \"Can I run Blender in WinXP?
