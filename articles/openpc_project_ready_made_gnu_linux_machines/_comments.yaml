    body: "Open-PC are \"special\" because they supply PCs that require no proprietary software at all - not even drivers. Yes you can get PCs cheaper but it's very likely you would need to install proprietary drivers to put GNU/Linux on them.\r\n\r\nOpen-PCs come with GNU/Linux pre-installed AND they will have no non-free software on them what-so-ever. This is an important point for many in the free software community. See [this article](http://www.freesoftwaremagazine.com/columns/open_pc_one_step_closer_open_hardware) written after the announcement of the Open-PC project for discussion on this.\r\n\r\n\\-\\-  \r\nEquitas IT Solutions - fairness, quality, freedom  \r\n[http://www.equitasit.co.uk](http://www.equitasit.co.uk)"

    body: "Thanks for the comment, and I'm glad you liked my book. :-)\r\n\r\nAbout your question:\r\n\r\nThe OpenPC concept is principally about the openness of the _hardware_. Obviously you can find free operating systems and install them on commodity computers, but it's tricky to find hardware where everything is open and fully supported by free software drivers.\r\n\r\nThe site you link to does take care of the installation, and no doubt they are taking some care to pick commercially-available systems that have relatively manageable hardware. But they're still basically just installing GNU/Linux on a commodity system that wasn't particularly designed for it.\r\n\r\nWhat OpenPC is doing is querying the community for what hardware will work best, then contracting manufacturers to make the systems to that specification. In other words, they're putting a GNU/Linux user community in charge of the hardware decision-making process and in charge of setting priorities for the hardware selection process.\r\n\r\nThat's a step up from the type of site you are pointing to in terms of the transparency of the hardware. It means that all of the software you use can be free software, all the way down to the metal. I'm not 100% sure they've achieved this (I think there may have been some issues with the BIOS), but this is the goal.\r\n\r\nThere is a further step, which I don't think OpenPC is doing, which is full disclosure of the hardware design and manufacturing data (sometimes called \"open source hardware\"). \r\n\r\nNot everyone cares about these issues (or for that matter about free software), and there's certainly room for many different niches. But for those who do care about the transparency of the hardware, OpenPC is pretty interesting.\r\n\r\nWhen I referred to \"vaporware\", I was talking about a number of attempts to create open hardware systems for GNU/Linux -- particularly game consoles -- that get a lot of buzz in the trade press, but then turn out to be mysteriously difficult to actually purchase! OpenPC has actually made it into production and retail sales, which is an achievement worth mentioning.\r\n"

    body: "The goal for the open-pc project was one of furthering freedom. Before this you couldn't easily get a pre-manufactured desktop system that didn't have non-free software dependencies (except for our systems although they come with Ubuntu at the moment). That is no GNU/Linux desktop system existed that intentionally was produced without the need for non-free drivers or firmware and still retained full support for things like 3D accelerated graphics. All that being said I should point out that no X86 system will ever be based on 100% free software. Even if we used the right components to produce an X86 system without a proprietary BIOS it still wouldn't be 100% free. You can stick on a 100% free OS. That doesn't mean it is 100% free as other pieces exist which are non-free still. To get a totally free system you would have to switch architectures. Only one company can really claim to produce a totally free system right now. It is a manufacturer in China which produces a non-x86 Netbook (I believe two versions exist one with a 7\" and one with a 10\" screen). Richard Stallman has one of these.\r\n\r\nWhat I want to point out is that you will not see a financial benefit to selling free systems. That is except for support costs potentially being reduced nobody is actively purchasing these systems. A totally free system is the only fully supportable system by the way. This is one of the reasons we encourage people to buy into freedom. Without freedom you will loose support for hardware rather quickly. The problems abound when it comes to non-free drivers/firmware. Wifi cards without free drivers/firmware don't \"just work\" as they should across distributions and time. Video cards loose support for 3D acceleration (3DFX on Microsoft Windows is a good example- company went out of business). Printers become obsolete in a single iteration of a particular distribution. Power management fails to work properly and poor battery life results. You can go through just about every category and if the device uses non-free drivers/firmware you will see problems on both free and non-free operating platforms such as Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X. These issue are not exclusive to GNU/Linux.\r\n\r\nOur computers and peripherals are meant to work across the spectrum of GNU/Linux distributions. We work with distributions to improve your freedom and ensure stuff \"just works\" as a totally free system should. When we have a device that uses a chipset that depends on a piece of firmware where it is 100% free for instance and those devices which depend on it don't work in GNU/Linux distributions which are free we take an initiative to correct the situation. We're working for instance to correct one such instance right now with an 802.11N USB wifi device. Before we started selling this 802.11N USB wifi device you couldn't get a competitively (retail) priced 802.11N card in the USA for under $70. Both the $70 free device and the one we sell did use the same chipset.\r\n\r\nWe worked with the open-pc project to correct 3D accelerated driver issues. These are the things you will get from buying a pre-manufactured computer designed for GNU/Linux compared to building it yourself. If you buy a random \"Linux\" computer from any other company in the USA right now you will end up needing non-free drivers and firmware. If you don't have a problem initially you are still almost guaranteed to run into a problem at some point.\r\n\r\nThe main reason we ship with Ubuntu is it is a supportable and easy to use distribution. That is largely it has drivers for current chipsets, has flash support, and is well integrated (auto-detection of not installed components, smooth upgrades, etc). Going forward we will be focusing more and more on Trisquel too for those users who are ready to go free. For those who don't know Trisquel is a newer free distribution based on Ubuntu that strips out the non-free components.\r\n\r\nChristopher Waid\r\nThinkPenguin.com\r\n\r\n"

Everyone is invited to take part in the preparations: currently there is an online poll at open-pc.com for the first product's hardware details (What form factors? Netbook or nettop? Optical drives?) and software additions.\r\n\r\nNow a final price of $300 to $400 is our current goal, assembly and international shipment included.
