<!-- Book Review: Animating with Blender by D. Roland Hess -->

Among the books I've read to get my head around the process of creating an animated film with Blender, this one is definitely the best. Nowadays you'll probably want to use Blender 2.5 or later, and this book is based on 2.49, but even with this problem, I'd still recommend it. The real win of this book is the way it deals with the synoptic view of the project: how to organize your project, how to break it down into manageable chunks, and even how to store it on disk. It's an excellent resource.

# Organization

This book is project oriented. It follows the production of a short film ("The Beast") all the way through from concept to final rendered video. The video itself can be viewed on the included disk.

# Who's it for?

Anyone wanting to make animated films in Blender should read this, especially if they are working alone or are in the position of directing and producing the project.

# Pros

Covers _everything_. Includes the best introduction to the Blender visual sequence editor, because it starts the way you are most likely to start -- with storyboard images. This book is organized to walk you through the process.

# Cons

Not as well organized as a reference work, and of course it cannot possibly be as deep as books that focus on just one aspect of Blender. Also, I had to knock one point off just because the book is for an older version of Blender and you'll have to do some mental converting if you are going to work in Blender 2.5.


## In short:
