    body: "I'm looking for a 2D equivilant of Vega Strike - like Escape Velocity for the Mac, but that will run on Linux and isn't too big a download. I would try Vega Strike, but it's not really possible for me to download 160 megabytes, and I've low-end integrated graphics.\r\n\r\nAre there any Escape-Velocity-like games out there for Linux?"

    body: "This game is excellent. The Forums are alive and well, the development is not dead, the game play is great once you \"get into it\". There are quite a few controls, and you may have to edit a config file with a text editor - but its worth it!\r\n\r\nI have a NVidea - and there are space stations that are pure chrome in appearance - where all you see are exact reflections of your surroundings... quite impressive. \r\n\r\nI needed to modify a config file because (in win32) my 3 axis joystick was perfect except the twist or z-axis was reversed. So one change and I was 100% configured!\r\n\r\nI have not mastered the commerce of it all yet - nor the battles - nor all the rules - but its a fun learning curve! Great game! I seriously would pay for this one - in fact I suggested on the forum how \"packaged cd disk sets or dvd's\" would be a great way to raise donation money.\r\n\r\nThis is one game that I really appreciate the efforts of the global community for. \r\n\r\nGreat Job People!\r\nJason"

    body: 'First of all I would like to say that Escape Velocity remains one of my favorite games. That said I have seen some serious potential from vega strike. My only problem has been that I cant find where to buy the upgrade for jump flight. One other warning, the difficulty settings adjust game speed so don''t make it too easy or you may find yourself getting very sleepy at the beginning and end of fights. '

The GUI has recieved a massive overhaul as well as a new autopilot system that's more than just a SPEC drive - it actually takes the path of lowest resistance and activates your spec drive, letting you just target a destination and click a button.\r\n\r\nI was unfortunate enough to unwittingly fly into Aera space... in a llama."
