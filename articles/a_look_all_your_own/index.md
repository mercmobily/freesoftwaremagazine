Why would you install your own copy of Linux just to have it look like everyone else’s copy? With such a wide array of themes available, there is no reason not to try out a few on your Linux PC.

[GNOME-Look](http://www.gnomelook.org/) is a great source for wallpapers, window decorations, splash screens and everything else you need to customize a Gnome based distribution (such as [Fedora](http://fedora.redhat.com) or [Ubuntu](http://ubuntu.org)). Thanks to the wide selection, the possibilities are almost limitless.

KDE users can look to [KDE-Look](http://www.kde-look.org/) for themes, icons and styles to custom their desktop.

Adding the custom themes and styles to your installation is also easy. Simply check your distribution’s documentation for specific instructions.

Enjoy your new look!
