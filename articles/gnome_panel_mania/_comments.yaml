From the website:\r\n\r\n\"Awn needs a composited environment to run in, therefore you should be running either AIGLX or XGL with a compositor (such as Compiz or Beryl).\"\r\n\r\nJust try installing and running AWN with compositing turned off - you get an ugly black bar across the bottom of your screen. Turn it back on and it looks perfect again :D\r\n\r\nJon\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
