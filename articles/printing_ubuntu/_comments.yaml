    body: "HI,\r\nI have found that printing with Ubuntu and most linux distros is a huge problem. The first problem is that it is no use telling people not to worry that their printer will be recognised and then not explaining how to configure it , or at least not pointing out that the following steps are the configuration, which will not work in my experience on at least 50% of the machines you try it on. Thats all just local machine work, wait till they ask you to do it on a virtual server.\r\n\r\nHere is the answer, fist check that your computer is built from A class parts, no dodgy cheap ram either, connect a HP printer to it USB if possible. Get round to your nearest PC World or equivalent, no shadey back street shops, and buy a copy of a program called Windows XP Professional and install it,  the printer will be recognised no problem, it will print immediately. Download all the updates make sure the firewall is activated, and  then install  a wireless router, connect the router to the computer using the ethernet connection on the motherboard of your computer or install an ethernet card. Then download and install a program called OpenOffice, its free and works really well, it opens Word and Excel files as well. If you want a backup program get Acronis True Image,full backup once a month and incrementals every night.\r\n\r\nfred_scotland\r\n\r\n\r\n  "

Install smb4k by typing the following into a Terminal window:\r\n\r\n<code>sudo apt-get install smb4k</code>\r\n\r\nWhen installation has completed, an icon should appear under Applications > Accessories. You can lauch smb4k using that or via the command line in a Terminal window:\r\n\r\n<code>smb4k</code>\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nI'm running Ubuntu 6.06 on a laptop with a CardBus wireless card networked to a BT HomeHub. I have plugged an HP PSC-2110 multifunction printer into the USB-A port of the BT HomeHub and managed to print to the printer, but it is unreliable: I have to unplug and plug in again the USB cable after each print job otherwise subsequent jobs do not print, so this is not a practical solution. Anyway, this is how I configured Ubuntu 6.06 to print to the printer via the BT HomeHub:\r\n\r\n1. System > Administration > Printing\r\n\r\n2. Double-click on 'New Printer'\r\n\r\n3. Select 'Network Printer' and 'Unix Printer (LPD)'\r\n\r\n4. In the 'Host' field enter the IP address of the BT HomeHub Samba Server, which is, by default on my BT HomeHub, 192.168.1.253\r\n\r\n5. In the 'Queue' field enter \"LPT1\" (without the quotes)\r\n\r\n6. Click 'Forward'\r\n\r\n7. Select the printer Manufacturer and Model (HP and PSC 2110 in my case)\r\n\r\n8. In my case the recommended Driver was \"hpijs (recommended) - HPLIP 0.9.7 (Suggested)\".\r\n\r\n9. Click on 'Forward'\r\n\r\n10. Enter whatever you want in the 'Name' field (no spaces allowed). I decided to call my printer \"PSC-2110-BT-HomeHub\" (without the quotes). Enter whatever you want in the 'Description' and 'Location' fields.\r\n\r\n11. Click on 'Apply'\r\n\r\n12. An icon for the printer should now be visible in the 'Printers' window. Right-click on this and select 'Properties'. Click on 'Print a Test Page' and the printer should print a test page.\r\n\r\nWarning: You may find that you can only print the test page, and any other subsequent job you send to the printer does not print. The only solution I have found for this so far is to cancel the print job in Printers and on the printer itself, unplug the USB lead then plug it in again, and then resend the job, which is unsatisfactory. Maybe you'll have more luck.\r\n"

    body: "Basically, HP provide fantastic support for their printers, and it's very easy to get them all up and running.\r\n\r\nCanon could not be more different.\r\n\r\nUnless your printer is from the ark, there are basically no drivers that alow you any functionality from your shiny new Canon.\r\n\r\nUnless, allegedly, you use a utility called 'Turboprint', which is commercial paid-for (paid-for before you know if it works, as well).\r\n\r\nSo my recommendation to anyone buying a printer, is to buy HP. And if, like me, you happen to have a Canon, then buy a HP. Or continue bouncing files to a Windows machine (or partition), which is so much fun. And efficient.\r\n\r\nCanon have really dropped the ball on this, and moreover they don't seem to care one little bit. Just try looking for any support for Linux on their site - none.\r\n\r\nYou actually have an option to specify Linux as your OS - and then it brings up nothing compatible! It's almost contemptuous.\r\n\r\nHP all the way, I'm afraid.\r\n\r\n"

Half the time I was updating a firewall, or waiting on firefox, it runs slower on windows, or I was telling my computer to not restart because it had an update.  Point is working on linux is just more productive.  If windows required less babysitting I would use it.  When I need to get work done half of that should not be maintaining a computer.'

I helped set up a wireless printer once for a friend and had to get one of my own. I tried the Netgear print server that worked fine with the Netgear router; however, when I switched to the US Robotics router and tried using the print server that is imbedded in it, I could no longer print from the Ubuntu notebook wirelessly. I decided to set it up on my network, which was quite simple, and connected it to another notebook that uses Windows XP Pro.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.barneyslabels.com.au\r\n"

    body: "GNU/Linux doesn't have most of the problems MS Windows does but you are still going to encounter situations like this if you venture into more advanced territories like vitalization.\r\n\r\nMy suggestion is get a tech who can help and stop complaining. There are plenty of people who make house calls. You can find better support for newbies at www.ThinkPenguin.com. They'll find you someone locally if they can't help you over the phone. It's a commercial service so you get real support. The one thing I like about them is if you buy hardware from them it'll work and it'll work well into the future without fuss. They get free software. It isn't just about development.\r\n\r\nAnyway. If you do get any hardware you'll see it's really easy to do the simple things like plugging in a printer as it is all right there for you. They document everything very clearly with pictures of USB ports, screen shots, and all that jazz. They do a better job than Apple or Microsoft in that regard. The stuff they sell just works, but if you are one of those people who can't figure out how to plug in a USB device the documentation exists."
