Right or wrong, most users I know don't consider it an operating system without a graphical interface. So should we start referring to GNU/Linux/KDE or maybe GNU/Linux/X11/Xfce? Wait a minute, KDE is built on Qt, so maybe that should be added in. And with the recent push toward web applications, maybe we should throw the browser in there as well, like GNU/Linux/Xll/Qt/KDE/SeaMonkey.\r\n\r\nOn the other side, I'm sure Pepsi would love to have their drinks no longer referred to as \"cokes\", not all facial tissues are \"Kleenex\", and Jell-O isn't the only maker of fruit gellatin.

    body: "The problem with the old BSD license wasn't about the commercial nature of advertising (free licenses are neither \"non-commercial\" nor \"anti-commercial\", remember).\r\n\r\nThe problem was that it put a burden on the end user and amounted to a restriction on _mere use_. That sort of condition conflicts with Stallman's \"Freedom Zero\" -- i.e. the freedom to use the program for any purpose.\r\n\r\nStallman (and others) argued that the BSD advertising clause was onerous, because, if applied to all of the software contributions to a distribution, would require covering the surface of the package up like a race car driver is with advertisements. It wasn't hard to come up with scenarios that easily showed how such requirements could get out of hand.\r\n\r\nI think the desktop info idea fails the same test: it would create a real mess if everybody jumped on the band wagon and started doing it (and if it's not something everyone can do, then it shouldn't be allowed, right?).\r\n\r\nOTOH, it _would_ be kind of cool looking to come up with a desktop like that, just for fun (of course not every project has a snazzy logo to use).\r\n"

It's at the top of every GPL license which is distributed with every GPL-licensed package.\r\n\r\nAnyone who bothers to read the license will find that even the Linux kernel is distributed with the preamble of the GPL which says:\r\n\r\n\"Preamble\r\n\r\nThe GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works.\r\n\r\nThe licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to your programs, too.\r\n\r\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.\r\n\r\nTo protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\r\n\r\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\r\n\r\nDevelopers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\r\n\r\nFor the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users' and authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.\r\n\r\nSome devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users' freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\r\n\r\nFinally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\r\n\r\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.\"\r\n\r\nhttp://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html"

Without the Unix replacement tools the GNU project provided, Linux would never have had any userspace, nor any development tools. That's why Torvalds agreed to use the GPL; it was only fair given the amount of code he was getting access to. The whole point of GNU and the FSF is to provide an _ecosystem_ wherein users' interests are paramount. This Stallman and his \"mad zealots\" have done spectacularly well.\r\n\r\nAnyone working with GNU/Linux in any manner is a user.\r\n\r\nThe fact that you can have this debate at all, or say rollout websites at low-cost, is thanks to rms. The other projects you mention, apart from X, owe their very existence to the GPL. Current Xorg development owes a lot to the GNU ecosystem too, since that is where a great deal of testing and development goes on.\r\n\r\nTake away gcc, GNU make, and GNU binutils, and see how far you get with developing your own OS, leave alone all the other myriad 'boring' utilities that make your work possible. Try getting your software ported to virtually any OS without GNU autotools, at a time when POSIX never existed.\r\n\r\nAll that doesn't make him my, or anyone's, saviour, but it does make him a lot more important than some of you make out, and it certainly means that any Linux installation is a great deal more than just a kernel, important though that part may be.\r\n\r\nYeah I say Linux too.
