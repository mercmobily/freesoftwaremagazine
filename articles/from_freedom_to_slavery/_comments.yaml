That makes this whole thing even <em>more</em> bizarre. I can't imagine the original negotiations. Perhaps Microsoft strong-armed Novell to the table in the first place. Perhaps Novell approached Microsoft. I do not know, though I would like to know.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft does not have a lock on software patents, by a long way. There are many companies and individuals with patents that could conceivably target Linux or GNU software. Novell is only marginally \"safer\" than any other Linux choice. Considering Microsoft's past dealings (a history Novell has experienced first-hand), I would say they are perhaps less protected than they seem. This certainly doesn't increase Novell's legal standing with GNU/Linux, nor shield them from patent litigation. To claim otherwise is disingenuous.\r\n\r\nIn any case, I do not believe Microsoft will safely be able to attack GNU/Linux directly with patents. Instead, it looks as if they are taking the indirect route, and attacking GNU/Linux with patent threats.\r\n\r\nThat is what Microsoft was after, I believe. They needed a credible GNU/Linux company to act as a patsy, which gives them the ability to question the validity of other vendors.\r\n\r\nThis is what they learned from SCO: the assertions of impropriety are more effective than trying to prove impropriety."

Maybe the financials of Microsoft's funny money payment to Novell over using Novell things when the SEC filings appear may make it clearer if it is all just about the size of the bribe.  Maybe they also really have a much huger disconnect with the community and the likely response (never impossible to make really stupid moves with group-think) or really believe they were going to be able to drive other vendors out of the market.

Now there back again, and we already know whats going to happen,\r\n apparently Ron Hovespan neglected to dig into his company's history of past\r\n dealings with MS, and the o' so wonderfull results gained.\r\n\r\nNow lets consider what MS Needs in a FOSS based Future OS,\r\n Foremost is Complete 'backwards compatability' with there existing software,\r\n and Solid Interoperability with there 'File Formats' and 'Filesystem's' \r\nThis is why there Indemnification is targeted at Samba (SMB/NMB/CIFS),\r\n Active Directory + Novell's eDirectory, and .Net/Mono.\r\n\r\nThe .Net/Mono point is Very important, as the problems OpenSuSE 10.1 have had,\r\n with there package/patch management tool relate directly to the next step,\r\n enshuring that they have controll over the core set of the apps that define\r\n the difference between distro's of GNU/Linux:\r\n the \"System Administration, and Configuration Infastructure\".\r\n\r\nNovell has been pushing very hard (and mostly behind the scenes, outside of the\r\n OpenSuSE development team)  to recreate the System Administration Toolchain\r\n (SuSEConfig, YaST, and SaX) using Mono/.Net.\r\n\r\nMono, relies heavily on MS's IP, Proprietary .Net Specifications,\r\n and Documentation as Mono is intended to be an (barely) OSS implamentation of\r\n .Net, the capability to Port Mono apps too .Net is very easy, and by providing\r\n More Internal details about the Proprietary API of .Net, they use one of\r\n the often overlooked points of Contamination in software design and development\r\n Proprietary Documentation of Specifications, Methods, and Procedures used in\r\n the Source Code, then you get asked a question like this:\r\n \"Did you learn how to implement that feature by accident, or did you pull it\r\n  out of the documentation that was handed to you?\"\r\n\r\nAnd wasn't this one of SCO's main claims, that parts, or whole chunks of the\r\n Linux Kernels code contained Proprietary Legacy System5 code, or what about\r\n the thousands of other separate applications, libraries, and documentation\r\n that constitute a standard GNU/Linux Distribution.\r\n  \r\nSo MS can say \"we wont come after you, for using our IP\", the real point is\r\n that they Want, and Need Mono developers to Use there Proprietary information.\r\n\r\nOnce Novell has Recreated its Administrative Toolchain w/ Mono,\r\n and Microsoft has Contaminated the Novell/SuSE enviroment,\r\n getting Novell to do the grunt work of porting, and developing the tools\r\n needed to transition MS's customers to there future OS,\r\n and destroyed the effectiveness of the other Distro's to Controll the Corporate\r\n FOSS landscape.\r\n\r\nThen they can take over Novell, rebrand SLES,SLED,OES as\r\n Microsoft Linux, cut off what ever might be left to OpenSuSE,\r\n and then the Legal war will begin, as MS will Own the Number 1 Linux Distro\r\n for Corporate, Embeded, and Consumer Environments, and have an vested interrest\r\n in gaining absolute controll over all of those separate pieces I mentioned\r\n above, how many of those Individual, unpaid developers could withstand\r\n a lawsuit from mighty Microsoft, when they make a claim that so and so coder\r\n is doing something bad to a piece of Microsoft's Linux OS ?, very few.\r\n\r\nThey will have a little talk with them, something like this: \r\n \"we can settle out of court, just sign this NDA, and transfer the licence of\r\n your code from that evil GPL, to our Shared Source Licence, or, we will sue you\r\n for 10 Million dollars.\" then one by one everyone of them will cave in,\r\n and of the few who don't, there apps can be Replaced entirely.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft has Embraced Linux with Novell,\r\nNovell has agreed to Extend the OS for Microsoft,\r\nMicrosoft will Exterminate the competition.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft Wins, Everybody else Loses, Game Over."

I think two people have hit on the patent subject without actually saying it.  So here goes my opinion.\r\n\r\n1.  Novell knows that if it came down to an Intellectual Property patent suit (between Linux and Unix), Linux wouldn't hold up.  No, Linux isn't using copied Unix code, but IP-wise it's close enough that the courts would probably rule in Unix'es favor.  That's why Novell asserted it's patent ownerships.\r\n\r\n2.  Microsoft could easily persuade Novell to enforce it's IP rights to Unix, seeing as how Novell actually has the patents.  If this happens, then Linux is effectively dead in the water.\r\n\r\nSo, what needs to happen is this.  Either portions (or all) of Unix need to be GPL'ed, or Novell and anyone else that holds patents for Unix (or at least the portions that Linux are derived from) need to make it publicly known that they will never enforce their patent rights against Linux.  If there is a legal-binding patent agreement that can be signed (basically one that says that the holders of the Unix Patents will never enforce them on anyone involved in the Linux development or use), then it needs to be signed.\r\n\r\nI really wish it was a perfect world.  At least in my home, Linux and Windows coincide perfectly together.  Neither one makes a fuss about the other, and they both know their purpose (and do their purpose quite well, actually).  Now, it's just a matter of convincing the people who have power that they can coexist.  Then, we'll probably see an end to this entire patent mess.  \r\n\r\nImagine it this way.  If corporations as a whole turn away from the Microsoft/Novell deal, and start backing other Linux distros, then Microsoft and Novell wouldn't have a solid leg to stand on.  Yes, Novell may have the patents, and Microsoft may have the money, but if enough big corporations say \"We're not going to pay you for this, when we can get it from xyz for free (or for the cost of minimal support).\" and the corporations put their money behind xyz and the other companies (if a legal challenge comes up), it's a lot of money that's weighing against Microsoft/Novell.  Maybe enough to run them under like SCO.\r\n\r\nIn all fairness and honesty, I should point out that I do use (and beta test) Microsoft products.  For me, it's a question of making a product the best that it can be.  It doesn't matter who's product, just the spirit of being involved in making it as good as possible.  Although some of my reasons for using their products are going by the way-side."

Despite being used to MS Windows since the first Ver. 3.0, I've found it easy to switch to GNU/Linux. \r\n\r\nNovell & MS would make it easier to MS Windows users to get used to the GNU/Linux environment & thus to spread the knowledge of Linux, and to trigger the curiosity of using or even just trying the other free distributions of GNU/Linux. Switching to other OS and leaving MS Windows behind will never become easy without the Novell MS agreement.\r\n\r\nSUSE was the poisoned pill for MS.

    body: "I wanted write a few rebuttals to your points. IANAL, please beware.\r\n\r\n\"Mono, relies heavily on MS's IP, Proprietary .Net Specifications, and Documentation as Mono is intended to be an (barely) OSS implamentation of .Net, the capability to Port Mono apps too .Net is very easy, and by providing More Internal details about the Proprietary API of .Net, they use one of the often overlooked points of Contamination in software design and development Proprietary Documentation of Specifications, Methods, and Procedures used in the Source Code, then you get asked a question like this:\r\n\"Did you learn how to implement that feature by accident, or did you pull it out of the documentation that was handed to you?\"\r\n\r\nWorst case scenario, GPL'd Mono code has become contaminated with Microsoft (MS) IP. The developer would have to go to court, but all we, the rest/users/coders would have to do is take the source and strip the MS IP out and rewrite the code. Thus eliminating an issue for all of us. Or?\r\n\r\n\"Once Novell has Recreated its Administrative Toolchain w/ Mono, and Microsoft has Contaminated the Novell/SuSE enviroment, getting Novell to do the grunt work of porting, and developing the tools needed to transition MS's customers to there future OS, and destroyed the effectiveness of the other Distro's to Controll the Corporate FOSS landscape.\"\r\n\r\nAgain, with us having the source, how could MS control us, short- or long-term? It may make it tough(er) but I believe we have people on our side that are just as good and probably more highly motivated than MS.\r\n\r\n\"Then they can take over Novell, rebrand SLES,SLED,OES as\r\nMicrosoft Linux, cut off what ever might be left to OpenSuSE,\r\nand then the Legal war will begin, as MS will Own the Number 1 Linux Distro\r\nfor Corporate, Embeded, and Consumer Environments, and have an vested interrest\r\nin gaining absolute controll over all of those separate pieces I mentioned\r\nabove, how many of those Individual, unpaid developers could withstand\r\na lawsuit from mighty Microsoft, when they make a claim that so and so coder\r\nis doing something bad to a piece of Microsoft's Linux OS ?, very few.\"\r\n\r\nAgain, fighting FOSS is a lot different than fighting another company. Even if a development team falls, nothing inhibits/prohibits a new group to form and start over/continue. If MS wants to isolate their version of Linux (I don't see entirely how they could do this, but lets say they succed) then they would, as is my belief, only hurt themselves.\r\n\r\n\"Microsoft has Embraced Linux with Novell,\r\nNovell has agreed to Extend the OS for Microsoft,\r\nMicrosoft will Exterminate the competition.\"\r\n\r\nFOSS, and Linux as a sub-set, is too big to chew off of for MS. My prediction would be that if they did this, they would only hurt themselves.\r\n\r\nWhat I do think is going on here is that Microsoft is getting into the consulting business and needs to have a poster example of working with a major Linux vendor to point to in order to show customers that they \"get\" Linux now, finally.\r\n\r\nJust my 2 cents."

Considering this was 48hrs before the start of the Patent Wars and Ballmer's direct threat to other distros, let me tell you that I used up my quota of 'I told you so' today.\r\n\r\nThe thing we always have to to worry is FLOSS being coopted by forces that want to neuter it. Just like US politicians are doing to the constitution they have sworn to uphold but have been clawing at for years or the Hollywood stars who are doing their charitable PR work and supporting terrorists in Kosovo and Bosnia or doing sham events like Live8 which is nothing more than shilling for the multinationals who are screwing the poor nations.

That's why I dont understand FLOSS promoters  and users who think the GPL is more of a hindrance. \r\nMy only problem with it is there is to many GPL violations that arent being taken to court because of the decentralized system.

Install and everything just works and works well. SuSE made life easier than any other OS. \r\n\r\nHowever, as much as I liked SuSE, after I watched the webcast I instantly understood the implications. I eradicated SuSE from my server and desktop boxes and removed my paid-for SLED from my laptop immediately.\r\n\r\nThis is not about MS aquiring their own Linux distro nor is it about helping customers. Microsoft's expansion in the enterprise is limited by the growing adoption of enterprise Linux. Namely Red Hat. Novell hopes to gain at Red Hat's expense and they may realize some short-term gains but MS wants something else. MS wants to expand in the enterprise at the expense of Linux in general. They also want to prevent any potential growth of desktop Linux.\r\n\r\nThe FUD created by the \"patent covenant\" will do alot of the job. But with Red Hat now offering indemnification MS may have no choice but to sue a couple of Linux companies. Novell has pushed risky Mono code throughout Gnome which is a part of most distros. Mono seems to be the focus of the \"patent covenant\".(it is assumed because we don't know what is involved in the patent agreement) The community doesn't have the financial resources to win a fight against MS in court. The result will be one choice. Novell Lnux. When this agreement expires all bets are off.\r\n\r\nWhere is IBM? Sun?\r\nAll of this becomes a non-issue if an IBM or Sun pledges to use their patent portfolios to defend Linux/FOSS in case of an MS attack. What would these companies stand to gain from the \"death\" of Linux? Possibly rejuvenated sales involving AIX and Solaris? Sure MS would gain but there are plenty of enterprises who would still need if not prefer a \"nix\" even if that means unix.\r\n\r\nBy entering into this agreement Novell has legitimized the MS claims of infringing IP and provided a golden opportunity for MS to spread FUD against the entire community. For this reason and for the sake of Linux/FOSS it is incumbent on the community to reject Novell in order to reject the \"IP\" infringement assertions and send a strong message that we will not be intimidated and we will fight back. It would also serve as a powerful warning to others that the community won't stand for betrayal.\r\n\r\nThis MS/Novell deal is far more dangerous than SCO ever was and by continuing to use SuSE you SJVN are enabling the comming attack on the software you claim to love."

Not anything else. Some individual files are licenceable under v3, but not the kernel in general.\" (http://lkml.org/lkml/2006/1/25/273)  Also, I found this in the GPLv2 interesting:\r\n\r\n\"7.  If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\" (http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html)\r\n\r\nBasically, I agree with most of what I have read so far.  Microsoft has come to terms that Linux is not just for hobbyists anymore.  What angers me and most of the people I know is that Microsoft has to buy out everything and everybody so it can be theirs and theirs alone.  If they tried working with the Linux community on its terms (meaning no money is involved and no threats of suing people who do contribute programs and code freely and willingly under the GPL) the world would be a much better place.  Just an example of what money is capable of and the driving force behind it.  Thanks to this, I will always use Linux now.  No more dual booting.  Go Red Hat!  Go Ubuntu!"

The marketplace is the environment in which natural selection actually takes place and the animals in this environment mostly possess the aforementioned "memes" and they want to live.  This kind of action is par for the course. Novell it seems has evolved into being symbiotically parasitic on the "beast from Redmond".
