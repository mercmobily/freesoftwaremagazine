    body: "The whole point of CC having a variety of licenses is to demonstrate that the copyright holding, self-publishing author is in charge of determining what their audience can do, i.e. to insinuate that copyright is properly a right of the author, to modulate as they see fit.\r\n\r\nIf CC was actually principled upon restoring to the public their freedoms suspended by copyright then it would have a copyright neutralising license, either abdicating it (cf BSD), or copylefting it (cf GPL).\r\n\r\nUnlike the FSF, CC is a pro-copyright organisation, hence its willingness to imply that copyright is as much a right one may wish to unreserve as inalienable/inviolable (natural) rights aka moral rights. Why on earth would someone wish to waive the moral right to authorship to permit someone to falsely claim authorship of their work? Conversely, given that the right to copy was derogated from the individual's right to liberty in 1709 by Queen Anne, it is quite laudable to wish to restore this to the public from whom it was stolen.\r\n\r\nTerry, apart from demonstrating a complicated interim migration path, you are in danger of suggesting that Creative Commons commit the apostasy of moving from an organisation principled on empowering authors' use of copyright to one principled on enabling/persuading authors to restore to the public their cultural liberty.\r\n\r\nA single, libertarian license is what a liberty principled CC would have created. Instead, espousing copyright as if a right, it has created a complex confusion of licensing pollution that has prevented a simple demarcation between copyright/proprietary and copyleft/free culture developing. This is probably the original objective, to consolidate copyright's prominence and importance in any self-publishing artist's consciousness.\r\n\r\nNina Paley has it right. <a href=\"http://blog.ninapaley.com/2010/11/08/license-to-love/\">\"Copying art is an act of love\"</a>. It is those who love an artist and their work who are driven to want to promote that artist, to share their published work among their friends.\r\n\r\nCultural intercourse is not something to be constrained by commercial privilege. We must move from an obsession with copyright and obeying the copyright holder, to loving art, respecting the artist, and honesty in sharing their work and promoting them. This means embracing moral rights, but deprecating anachronistic constraints on distribution, copying, communication, or commerce. <em>If you love me, sing my song, tell my story, but be true.</em>"

This is less about commercial exploitation of my work than it is about ensuring that a financial barrier for people to enjoy this work should not be re-imposed once I have removed it.\r\n\r\nHaving said that you are correct in that the SA is somewhat redundant when it comes to the NC part of the licence but it is not when it comes to the attribtution. A By-NC licence insists that any derivative includes an attribution to me and the original but it does not prohibit a \"remixer\" from licencing their derivative under an NC-only style licence. SA explicitly says \"I've used CC licencing you must do so too\". At least my understanding of it does. Without it somebody could create derivatives of my work, attribute the original and place a custom \"freeware\" licence on it. Further derivatives could then lose association with the original and this in my view devalues my contribution to the work.

    body: "That's my favorite quote from Nina Paley on this, and it sums up the problem nicely. The only way anyone can \"impose\" a financial barrier on your work is if they can get a monopoly on it. By using a \"ShareAlike\" license, you deny that possibility, so the exploitation you fear can't happen anyway (no one is going to pay extra money to someone who didn't produce the work when they can get it for free from the source).\r\n\r\nYou could raise the objection that they might not _know_ they can get it for free, except: the \"Attribution\" part of the license allows you to insist that your original publishing source is listed, and the By-SA license also must be noted when the work is used.\r\n\r\nProtecting your own monopoly is the only real benefit of NC licensing -- it allows you to create scarcity and thus maintain higher prices on selling your work (such as the books you are publishing). It's debatable whether that's actually necessary. But, assuming it is, that's the niche for Non-Commercial licenses.\r\n \r\nA few points have been raised (not just by you) about the value of the SA _terms_ with NC. That's fine -- I acknowledged that those might turn up, but in my opinion, there's no one using By-NC who would object to the SA terms.\r\n\r\nSo, it'd be completely reasonable to fold those into the NC module. The problem is the confusion created by the _name_ \"By-NC-SA\", which encourages people to conflate the two \"SA\" licenses, as if they were related, when they are really unrelated in their effect. The naming suggests a false parallelism.\r\n\r\nSo let me suggest this to you -- if the license you use now were called simply \"By-NC\", how would that bother you? Because that would be closer to the outcome I suggest.\r\n"

Where in a By-NC clause does it say that the attribution must state how much the derivative creator paid for the work? It doesn't. Thus someone getting a derivative from a more well known source than I, could easily presume that because the derivative is charged for, so is the original source.

Yes it is unlikely that those using and supporting CC works would not inform their users of the original work but as CC grows we need to remember that the ethos of those using it will be watered down by those more comfortable with traditional copyright monopolies and exploitation.\r\n\r\n\\-\\-  \r\nEquitas IT Solutions - fairness, quality, freedom  \r\n[http://www.equitasit.co.uk](http://www.equitasit.co.uk)"

That's not how copyright licenses work.\r\n\r\nRedistribution of your work by a third party doesn't change the fact that you hold copyright, and that your terms are still binding on any recipient. If you distribute to Betty under By-NC terms, and Betty derives a work from that and redistributes the result to Carol, the only license Carol can have in *your* work is the By-NC terms. Betty doesn't get to remove the terms of work in which you hold copyright.\r\n\r\nBetty can apply whatever terms she likes to *her* work, but any part of that work which is yours is still under By-NC terms no matter who gets it from Betty."

Carol receives the work under the same terms, since the copyright holder (you) hasn't changed.\r\n\r\nBetty can derive a work from yours and redistribute the result, but that **doesn't change the terms on the part in which you hold copyright**. Betty's work might be CC-NC, but only the part in which Betty holds copyright; the part of the work which is yours must still be attributed by the terms of CC-By-NC.\r\n\r\nIn that case, Carol receives a combined work with different parts under different terms. Carol must still abide by all the terms when she receives the combined work; nothing has been re-licensed.\r\n\r\nSome free-culture licenses specifically permit re-licensing. **The CC licenses do not grant permission to re-license**.

So, if you were to distribute a work to Betty under CC-By-SA, then Betty could derive a work from that; she and you would then both hold copyright in the combined work. The SA clause restricts Betty's redistribution: she has permission to redistribute only under the same terms.\r\n\r\nThe **permission to re-license was never present to begin with**, and the SA clause doesn't change that.\r\n"

There is often \"moral rights\" or \"author's rights\" legislation in many jurisdictions that would prohibit claiming another person's work as your own, regardless of licensing status.\r\n\r\nBut assuming that such legislation doesn't exist in your jurisdiction, Ryan may be right that the absence of a ShareAlike clause would permit removal of attribution in some cases of derived works.\r\n\r\nCrosbie Fitch would probably argue that there are ethical reasons _not_ to constrain the licensing on derivative works. Ryan clearly disagrees. I'll consciously demure from that discussion. :-)\r\n\r\nHowever, going back to my original point -- this isn't about the \"legal code\" of the CC licenses, but about the branding. I assert that \"By-NC-SA\" is fundamentally misleading and confusing because users think it works similarly to the \"By-SA\" license. But it doesn't. \r\n\r\nIt works almost exactly like the \"By-NC\" license -- and any differences are likely to have been unintentional on the part of the licensor (most users of By-NC probably expect or want it to work like By-NC-SA, so changing the terms to merge the two would only close loopholes that the licensors didn't want anyway).\r\n\r\nWhat I propose is to fold the minimal \"sharealike\" requirements that concern users like Ryan into the By-NC license, and eliminate \"By-NC-SA\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

I want to emphasise here that I am an advocate for choosing the appropriate licence in each case. You make it sound like I am being unethical - actually my aim is the opposite here. I'll say it again: the cartoons on here are CC:By-NC-SA primarily because I want to prevent others from charging for work I have allowed to be of no cost. By \"restricting\" the licencing* and usage of derivatives I am trying to ensure that these strips are kept available at zero cost. To me that's an ethical choice, maybe it does mean I am infringing the \"rights\" of derivative creators but honestly that a huge grey area. These are not educational and in the great shape of things nobody goes without food, water, shelter, air or even enjoyment (or not) of my cartoons because of my choice of licence.\r\n\r\nWith regards my concerns over attribution. There is a difference between the CC understanding of attribution and the \"moral right\" clauses of copyright law in many jurisdictions (including my own native UK). The former generally requires some kind of pointer to the original work. The latter simply requires you say who made the original work. This is why I say the SA protects the CC attribution part.\r\n\r\n_\\* I maintain that any licence other than public domain imposes restrictions upon users and derivative creators of the work_\r\n\r\n\\-\\-  \r\nEquitas IT Solutions - fairness, quality, freedom  \r\nhttp://www.equitasit.co.uk"

Hence people repeating the canard that the BSD is freer than the GPL because it gives the licensee the 'freedom' to choose how they license derivative works.\r\n\r\n'Freedom to enslave' is not liberty.\r\n\r\n'Freedom to re-apply copyright to prevent others copying one's published work' is not liberty.\r\n\r\n'Freedom to pretend another's work is one's own' is not liberty, but plagiarism, fraud, dishonesty, etc.\r\n\r\nThis brings us to the moral right to authorship. This is not a privilege to force others to credit the author (as CC insinuates it). It's a natural right. So let's not let it slip into the travesty that trademark is where people claim ownership over words, symbols, colours, etc. An author has the right to identify themselves as the author of their work. The public have a right not to be deceived as to the authorship of a work. It's all about truth, not an obligation to give credit, citation, or attribution. There's an obligation against misattribution, but this isn't the same as an obligation to give attribution. It's a subtle point, easily lost on people eager for ever more power over their fellows. You can tell another author's story without having to credit them. You just have to avoid dishonesty concerning authorship, e.g. stating or implying that you are the author."
