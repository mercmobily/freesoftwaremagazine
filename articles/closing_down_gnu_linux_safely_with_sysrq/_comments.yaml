    body: 'I found this article very useful as I sometimes find myself in a situation such as this and am forced to turn the computer off manually. I have on problem though. On my laptop SysRq is a function key and there is no key on my laptop to lock the function key down, if that makes sense. Is there some way I can change the combination or another solution?'

On my laptop I did it with this combination:\r\n\r\nAlt + Function + SysRq + x (where x is one of R S E I U B etc.)\r\n\r\nYou may need to experiment if, for example, your laptop prefers it to be entered as:\r\n\r\nFunction + SysRq + Alt + x\r\n\r\nI don't have my laptop with me at the moment, so I'm not sure if it works both ways (When it worked the first way, I didn't try the other).\r\n\r\n"

The only thing that usually comes up is "HELP" menu in Firefox (alt + Fn + sysrq + H) or ksnapshot (K desktop). I tried it on my desktop PC with same OS and KDE, and only ksnapshot opens up. Any ideas?'

    body: "Sadly, on my laptop, the kernel sysreq handler seems to interpret all the UIOPJKL;M,./ keys as part of the number pad, so this mostly just changes the log level. (more complex than that, because I use dvorak, so these keys are actually GCRLHTNSMWVZ).\r\n\r\nBtw, to turn off the screen capture, you just need to edit your key bindings in X windows.  Makes it much easier to test.  Do a tail -f /var/log/messages to see what its doing."
