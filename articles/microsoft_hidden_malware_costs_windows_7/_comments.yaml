    body: "Well with that question both answers are correct so it becomes a bit of a moot point. The question I asked was based on the two opinions I saw the most frequently: one blaming MS and the other blaming the IT people responsible for the systems. The truth is - as you imply - that dealing with malware (and thus providing the expensive support procedures and people) is a hidden cost of Windows. Having to deal with malware in the first place is directly down to Microsoft no matter how much they might like to try and wriggel out of it by saying it's all \"your idea\".\r\n\r\nThis is what I am getting at through the post and sum it up when I said..\r\n\r\n> \"If your chosen OS means you have to buy and install anti-virus software on clients and servers, hire more staff to patch and maintain it and pay through the nose to hire people to fix a problem caused by vulnerabilities in the OS then those things should be added to the TCO\"\r\n\r\ncheers  \r\n\\-\\-  \r\nEquitas IT Solutions - fairness, quality, freedom  \r\nhttp://www.equitasit.co.uk"

    body: "There is one other penalty incurred by running Windows which I don't see mentioned very often, and that is the performance hit taken by having to run all of the necessary anti-malware. Rumour has it that Win 7 executes a bit faster than its bloaty and inefficient predecessor, but my personal experience when running any MS OS is that anti-malware puts a noticeable dent in the performance of older, slower machines. Between that and the much bigger performance hit taken due to their OS's relatively slower execution, hardware has to be upgraded or replaced more frequently. My old Pentium 866MHz box with 512MB RAM ran a bit slow with OpenSuSE 10.3, was much slower with XP SP3, but was an absolute slug once I upgraded my CA antivirus and installed new anti-spyware.\r\n\r\nCould OSS help the environment by reducing WEEE tonnage via less-frequent upgrades and allowing the use of less power-hungry client machines?"
