    body: "1) Figure out how much the PDF costs to produce\r\n2) Figure out how many of those who downloaded the last one would pay for a copy, e.g. 1%.\r\n3) Visit Fundable.org and create the appropriate group action.\r\n4) If the fund is achieved, collect the money and produce the PDF (for all). If not, no one pays anything.\r\n\r\nFor example, let's say the PDF cost $1,000 to produce. Let's say it got downloaded by 10,000 readers. Let's say only 100 readers would be prepared to pay. That makes it $10 per reader.\r\n\r\nYou can tweak the amounts, e.g. try for 200 paying $5.\r\n\r\nYou don't have to do it per issue, but per annum - to cut transaction overheads.\r\n\r\nIf you have 800 paying $15 for a year's subscription - that could be cheaper.\r\n\r\nMy point is that perhaps if you create a collective bargain there'll be more take up than people charitably donating only to find that you're still short of funds to produce the PDFs they want.\r\n\r\nIt's a choice between a bargain (money for PDFs - or no deal) or charity (money for a warm feeling and possibly a fruitful outcome).\r\n"

    body: "I posted on Dave Guard's thread about \"passing the hat\", this is basically one way to do that -- collect funds until it's possible to create a PDF.\r\n\r\nIn fact, it might be even more sensible to approach the problem as \"funding each issue\".\r\n\r\nRather than creating \"issues\" on a monthly basis, continue to accumulated content on the website. Then raise pledges to support an issue (provide some kind of \"thermometer\" graphic, for example, to give people an idea of how much is needed). Then when you raise enough cash, pay for the process of creating that issue. You could even include the payments for commissioned authors in this budget.\r\n\r\nThen you just release an issue whenever the readership is willing to pay for it.\r\n"

    body: "A nice idea and - like most of the economical solutions to this problem I have seen - it works in theory. I'm not sure it would work in practice though because it relies on the premise that the readers who want PDF are prepared to pay for them - or at least enough of them are.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure that given the opportunity to purchase a PDF or read a zero cost online edition whether most of those 100 people wouldn't just plumb for the latter anyway. People will say \"I'll pay for it\" but would enough of them - I think not and the experience of this magazine seems to confirm this. I think it's likely that most of the people who have whined on Tony's original editorial want PDFs at zero cost rather than PDFs per se. Let's be honest most people would, given the option, go for zero cost content in the first instance anyway and once they had that why would they start paying for it?\r\n\r\nPersonally I can't see the point of PDFs in this situation. All the arguments I have seen for PDF versions can be met by the existing online version and a few moments work by the person who actually wants them."

If there aren't enough people pledging, then no-one pays anything, and no-one wastes any time producing PDFs that there is an insufficient demand for.\r\n\r\nI think I downloaded a PDF once - just to see what I was missing. But, I'm ready to believe that there are loads of FSM readers who'd love to print out a copy so that they can read it on their train to work each day.\r\n\r\nWho knows?\r\n\r\nPerhaps this is a candidate for a Poll?\r\n\r\nHow much do you want the PDFs back?\r\n1) I would pay $40 or more for a year's subscription.\r\n2) I would pay $20-39 for a year's subscription.\r\n3) I would pay $10-19 for a year's subscription.\r\n4) I would pay $5-9 for a year's subscription.\r\n5) I wouldn't buy a subscription, but I might buy copies occasionally for $5 each\r\n6) I'd search for copies subscribers posted elsewhere\r\n7) FSM should be free - I'll go elsewhere if you start charging people for PDFs\r\n\r\n\r\n(7 is a shibboleth/honeypot)"
