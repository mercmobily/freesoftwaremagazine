Nobody can implement a spreadsheet from that.. nobody.\r\n\r\nODF is a horrible standard, compared to it OOXML even with it's own horror looks like a work of art. But that just goes to show the type of honesty found in the ODF camp, proponents are entirely unwilling to acknowledge shortcomings of their standard while all to willing to point out flaws in opposing standards.\r\n\r\nInstead we should seek to build one truly good standard, an extensively described standard because neither is currently good enough, though as a long time Linux user I hate to admit that in this case Microsoft hit way closer to the mark than we did. They did an extensive standard, suitably verbose but with ugly spots.. I'd take ugly over missing - at least I can implement ugly, there is no way I can sanely implement missing stuff without doing guesswork which will lead to errors and thus bad user experiences, broken documents and assorted pain."

Remember OOo's \"native\" format was originally \"SXW\" files, but they adopted ODF after it was developped with others.\r\n\r\nAlthough there are about ten pages EXCLUSIVELY devoted to spreadsheets in the ODF spec there are hundreds of pages relevant to spreadsheets.  The entire table, formatting, styles, charting, base settings and the bulk of the other functionality are shared with other parts of the office specification and are not included in those \"10 pages\".  The entire thing fits together well and is well planned.\r\n\r\nNo one claims that ODF is perfect, as can be deduced that ODF version 1,1 is on it's way, however it is based on sane XML and existing standards.  OOXML is not, nor do Microsoft pretend that it is.  They justify their peculiar XML naming structure as required for \"performance\", and they almost admit that THAT IS an XML-ization of the .doc,.xls and .ppt files.  In fact they promote that as an advantage for tham.

It is vendor neutral and well thought out.  I am not a Microsoft hater, nor do I think users of MS Office should switch.  I believe microsoft should stop playing the bully and adopt ODF for document interoperability.

That is why Microsoft and it's trolls are so violently opposed to ODF, and why Microsoft uses XML to wrap proprietary, undocumented binary blobs that makes it impossible for anybody except Microsoft to properly implement OOXML.  The truth is that come the next version of Microsoft Office after 2007, Microsoft yet another  new set  of incompatible binary blobs, to create yet another OOXML format incompatible with the current one to force a user upgrade. That  is after all the whole basis of  Microsoft's business model, and the  reason why Microsoft is refusing point blank to  implement ODF filters in MS Office.\r\n\r\nI accept your argument that Microsoft through it's abusing control of bundling office suite software into OEM Windows has eliminated competitors like Wordperfect to  achieve a market monopoly.  Hovever I cannot see how this can be used as an  argument for OOXML to be made a ISO standard. What is the point after all in an ISO \"standard\" that only one company (which already has products compliant products) can implement, other than to  confuse  the  public  into not adopting  a genuine vendor neutral and universally adoptable standard, namely ODF? I mean why does OOXML need to be given an ISO number if only Microsoft can  implement it?

Its very clear you are in bias of Microsoft's side yourself.\r\n\r\nYou took the easy way out saying <strong>\"i will let other readers see that through\"</strong>, which translates to \"I'll let someone else provide the evidence\", when you clearly have NONE. At best, you went on a personal attack with <strong>\"If you were a lawyer, i am sure people would have stripped you off your degree.\"</strong>\r\n\r\nThat's just typical behaviour of someone who has NO CLUE of either OOXML or ODF standards. I bet, that you are using MS Office 2007, and you have fallen in love with the interface.\r\n\r\n\r\nLet me give you an example why its a bad idea to have 2 standards.\r\nIf you do engineering, you have to study both the Metric and Imperial systems for length, weight, etc.\r\n\r\nThat is, in Australia, UK, etc, we use kilograms, metres, etc.\r\nIn USA and anyone else who uses the Imperial system, they use pounds, miles, inches, etc.\r\n\r\nSo what happens when you do a group project from people around the world?\r\n\r\nYou get an accident or a potential problem waiting to happen because not everyone is clear on which standard they should be using. And this confusion DOES happen in real life, not just in theory.\r\n\r\nNASA has experienced this very issue, and it has resulted in a loss of a few million dollars of US taxpayer money...Flushed down the toilet.\r\n\r\nSo you want the entire world to waste time and money converting docs back and forth between two standards? (Time IS money)\r\n\r\n\r\nYou speak of \"standards monopoly\", when the only company that is trying to avoid an international standard that is ODF, is the very company that is known for monopolistic practices! That's right, MICROSOFT. They developed OOXML because they knew they'll lose control!\r\n\r\nThey could've adopted ODF, and NO ONE was forcing them not to. They chose NOT to accept ODF on their own accord. Why? Because the whole point is about control. CONTROL = PROFIT.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft controls documents standards in an effort to corner everyone to use MS Office. They will NEVER release ALL the details of their document formats, and you will be forever needing MS Office to achieve 100% accuracy in reading doc. This is why when you try to open a doc file in OpenOffice, Abiword, etc, you will always get some issue with the layout. Microsoft knows that the average user will never accept other office applications when it cannot read their files correctly. This is how they keep their dominance. They make it so that you need them, and there's the feeling that you cannot leave them. \r\n\r\nThe point of ODF is to allow EVERYONE (including Microsoft) to agree on one document standard that the WHOLE WORLD can adopt. It frees everyone the need to specifically use MS Office. They can use whatever office suite or application they choose. And that's the point. NO ONE is tied down to Windows and MS Office. NO ONE is cornered into paying for a copy (license) of MS Office. (which is what MS does NOT want).\r\n\r\nThis is a point you've COMPLETELY fail to understand. I can tell its completely over your head.\r\n\r\nYOU ARE doing are MAJOR dis-service for OOXML by putting YOUR personal opinion into it. Your personal opinion has NOTHING to do with the document standards.\r\n\r\nOOXML isn't a completely open standard. It has proprietary or vendor specific functions that you need to know in order to get it 100%, if you were to implement a word processing application yourself. \r\n\r\nSuch functions include:\r\n\r\nSection: 2.15.3.6\r\nautoSpaceLikeWord95 (Emulate Word 95 Full-Width Character Spacing) \r\n\r\nSection: 2.15.3.26 \r\nfootnoteLayoutLikeWW8 (Emulate Word 6.x/95/97 Footnote Placement) \r\n\r\nSection: 2.15.3.32 \r\nmwSmallCaps (Emulate Word 5.x for the Macintosh Small Caps Formatting) \r\n\r\nSection: 2.15.3.51 \r\nsuppressTopSpacingWP (Emulate WordPerfect 5.x Line Spacing) \r\n\r\nSo don't pull this nonsense about bias. Its bloody obvious who's bias here.\r\n\r\n\r\nMicrosoft talks about \"interoperability\", but do they really do it on their own accord? OR is this all a farce because the EU's anti-trust case is pushing them into it?\r\n\r\nSeriously, if MS wants interoperability, all they had to do is completely open their formats. Then there will be NO NEED for both ODF and OOXML in the first place!\r\n\r\nThey won't, because the ultimate goal for them is to profit on a massive scale. To profit, you need to control and corner your customers into playing your game, under your rules. In the tv show, 24, Jack Bauer calls this kind of thing: \"leverage\".\r\n\r\nAnd that's the key issue. OOXML only exists because ODF exists. ODF exists, because Microsoft won't COMPLETELY open their existing formats to the world. This is all because they want you to be completely dependent on a specific application or product they happen to be selling...That is, MS Office. "

So why has ODF special embedding objects for java applets and other embedding for other objects ??\r\n\r\nSo why is ODF as an interoperable format not supporting ISO 216 standard paper sizes but has it in stead flexible printer paper sizes which are not really interoperable unless they happen to conform to a standard which means that standardization is implementation defined in stead of format defined. \r\nYou are also suggesting that a converting stringtype percentage to a numeric is hardly more demanding than converting a decimal number. firstly you should understand that a decimal point is hardly a standard. I use a decimal comma. For a name that requires stringlike verification anyways thatis not a problem but for a value it is actually is. Storing decimal numerics without a decimal point is actually more standard than using a decimal point or a decimal comma. \r\n\r\nYou state that Microsoft should store their unique quirks in a generic \"config\" tag or similar rather than on the main name-space. Reading your article I will now state that if they would have done you would now have written about the evil Microsoft hiding Office setting in config setting that are actually completly non interoperable by design. ODF's config setting items are a huge implementation nightmare. Only an ODF fan would suggest they are a solution. Even the custom tags in OOXML are far better as at least they require custom schema validation and are unique because of the XML custom namespace use.\r\n\r\nYour oppinions are noted but seems like you based it purely on onesides very limited research and knowledge of format issues with OOXML while you seem to support ODF which has also lot's of it's own issues. \r\n\r\nA big issue of ODF is that this standard made for interoperability does not know any two interoperable implementations yet.\r\n\r\nIs OOOXML an ideal standard ? No. \r\nBut actually fasttracking standards never are because they are standarsds derived from existing technology.\r\nIt is easy to hammer on OOXML for it's compatibility issues which aren't always the optimal solutions but frankly this whole article feels like you would not have minded the same issues if they just would have been in a format that was used by OpenOffice !!!!\r\n\r\nThe Wraith\r\n<a href=\"http://ooxmlhoaxes.blogspot.com>http://ooxmlhoaxes.blogspot.com/</a>"

    body: "The Wraith:\r\n\r\nThank you very much for your comments.\r\n\r\nI agree with you that ODF is not perfect, I never claimed it was, but after examining both ODF and OOXML I would say ODF was miles ahead as a candidate for a standard, in fact I think OOXML does not meet the basic criteria to become one.\r\n\r\nI agree with you on the ISO 216 and ODF - it should support it instead of just storing the page widths and heights despite it is easy for an application to extrapolate the ISO 216 name from the sizes.  What ODF should not be changed to do is make up it's own non-standard cryptic page names which is what OOXML has done.\r\n\r\nAs for your arguments on the \"config\" tag I think you have missed the point of it.  Microsodt Office has unique configuration settings only relevant to it, so does OpenOffice.org, so does KWord, so does AbiWord, so does Lotus Notes, so do every other office suite in existance.  At the moment I can create a file in KWord then load it in OpenOffice.org and then in AbiWord.  Each presents and can manipulate the content satisfactorily and pass it on.  Although some configuration option changes were not transferred because they were unique to the previous application does not effect interoperability.  To limit the \"config\" options to those of one application simply is limmiting the format to that one application locking out use by all others, some would say that is Microsoft's goal.\r\n\r\nFor instance, when using OOXML it is possible to specify formatting quirks unique to MS Word 2003, but not possible to state the ones unique to KOffice.  That means that MS-Word can save and load the file without problems, but Koffice cannot as settings would be lost in the interim making the format impossible to use with Koffice.  However, both Koffice and Word can use ODF satisfactorily (or could if MS were not so negative about it).  Although unique application settings could be lost when passing the document from a user of MS-Word and KOffice, and I agree that is not perfect, it is a million miles better than simply ignoring KOffice and all other non Microsoft office programs exist.\r\n\r\nHopefully in the future applications can store and pass on \"config\" settings not applicable to it in a manner similar to the \"about:config\" screen in Firefox.  However, the lack of this in current applications is the fault of the applications, not the format.\r\n\r\nMost configuration settings define some precise operation and rendering quirks.  Operation quirks are not relevant to inter-operability and to transfer a precise representation of a rendered document you should use a standard like PDF, not an editable document format, which is really for work-in-progress transfers.\r\n\r\nAs for accusing me of criticizing Microsoft if they tried to improve relationships with other office suite vendors, you have me very wrong.  I would be singing their praises if they did that, but unfortunately they are not.\r\n\r\nAs for the JAVA Applet point.  JAVA is not an ISO standard, however it is on the verge of becoming an open source project and is run by the Java Community through the Java Community Process and it's APIs are published, also the APPLET tag was taken straight out of HTML4.  Although this does not make the APPLET tag ideal again it is a million miles better than including closed proprietary formats in what is supposed to be an open specification.\r\n\r\nAm I one-sided?  Maybe I am, but that is AFTER I analyzed both ODF and OOXML specs.  I came to each spec with an open mind.  ODF is not perfect as a standard, but OOXML is unacceptable as one.\r\n\r\nODF IS interoperable, and being used as such.  OOXML limits functionality to that of Microsoft Office.  It would be nice if Microsoft joins the rest of the world in supporting ODF properly, such us including it in the Save/Open dialogs and being able to make it the default format, then these arguments and articles will all become moot and we can move on happily exchanging documents with EVERYBODY.\r\n\r\n\r\nEddy"

We work hard to help our ISV's succeed! ... So, We're Just Here to Help Developers, Right? ... <strong>We're Here to Help Microsoft!</strong> Microsoft pays our wages. Microsoft provides our stock options. Microsoft pays our expenses. We're Here to Help Microsoft By  helping those developers That can best help Microsoft Achieve Microsoft's objectives. Did anyone miss the point here?\"\r\n\r\nIt might be the case that by standardizing OOXML, Microsoft doesn't try to help its customers or the developers of free software Office alternatives as much as it tries to help Microsoft.\r\n\r\nThat's the concern. Maybe Microsoft's intentions are all good this time (yeah, right!), but it might not be clever to trust in that.\r\n"

You can also OLE embed ODF files in OOXML and OLE embed OOXML in ODF. \r\nThirdly you mention a special enumeration type for OLE embedding as an issue/problem in the OOXML spec but when it comes to ODF special exemptions in the specs it is suddenly ok ???\r\n\r\nIt look like watching at the different specs with a double standard.\r\n"

Will spreadsheets convert to the timezone of the reader or show the date in the timezone of the maker ? How will those spreadsheets deal with files created in ne timezone and editted in another timezone. Remember that in spreadsheets in general dates are generalle inserted without with a timezone so that it is up to the implementation to apply a timezone. Enjoy the hell that is ISO dates when using spreadsheets globally within a company.\r\n\r\nAt most ISO 8601 should be an alternative storage format for dates in spreadsheet cells. However the complexity of such a format is startling and people do not understand that it is MUCH MUCH more difficult for spreadsheets interpretation than a numeric format. Having build a small spreadsheet once the idea of ISO dates alone is just giving me headaches"

Else it just would be to hard to implement for every software builder.\r\n\r\nA ISO date is just a complex representation of a continuous timeline. A numeric date is a simple representation of a continuous timeline. For use in spreadsheets, ISO dates are overly complex and will need to be toned down dramatically so they are not much more than a formatted numeric date. "

They are stored, archived and retrieved.\r\n\r\nIn order to retrieve an archived document you must have software that is the original or compatible. However, commercial vendors and their proprietary formats tend to drop compatibility, once they have eliminated a competitive product. That means you can't access your document any more.\r\n\r\nWhy is that different with an open standard? Well, because it is not a secrete and you are legally able to write any conversion to a new format that may have superseded it. And surely when many applications support the same (agreed upon) format then chances are much higher that compatible software will survive.\r\n\r\nWhy is that important?

Universal? Something else?  Not a unique problem.\r\n\r\nI think that you underestimate software builders, and overestimate the difficulty of implementing ISO 8601, but time will tell."

However, I have found what I consider counter-examples... Cases in which standards, rigidly observed, render the subject of the standard more complex, burdensome, and opaque than necessary. None of my examples target Office products, so I beg your indulgence...\r\n\r\nIn the programming world there are language standards. One of those standards is <em>ISO/IEC 7185 Pascal</em>. Per the section 6.8.3.5 <strong>\"Case-statements\"</strong> states <cite>\"One of the case-constants shall be equal to the value of the case-index upon entry to the case-statement; otherwise, it shall be an error.\"</cite>\r\n\r\nVarious Pascal vendors have --in my opinion-- properly violated the standard by providing a vender-supplied-violation to section 6.8.3.5, namely a \"catch-all\" statement (usually implemented as <strong>otherwise</strong> or <strong>else</strong>). Alas, there is no syntactic standard for the \"catch-all\". Therefore, porting code from one compiler implementing a \"catch-all\" to another implementing a \"catch-all\" requires some minor text changes. On the other hand, writing code that strictly adheres to the standard results in code which in my experience (a) is more complex, (b) has reduced readability, and (c) has increased maintenance costs.\r\n\r\nMany other areas in the (Pascal) standard are also deficient... to the point the standard is pretty much irrelevant. While I find those details sufficiently annoying that I would not willingly use a product that implemented only the standard, those details are not relevant to the point I am trying (probably unsuccessfully) to make... that while official standards are generally good:<ul>\r\n<li>they are never perfect;\r\n<li>they are out-of-date as soon as published because innovation, fortunately, does not stop;\r\n<li>the standards process may be hijacked by parties with political agendas, which results in standards that are of limited use to anyone else.\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nI have no good solution to the problem...  Other than my old man's general caveat:\r\n<strong>\"Scrutinize everything, trust no-one.\"</strong>\r\n\r\nKeith\r\nFull disclosure: I own stock in MSFT & SUNW. I use MSFT and Sun products. I have been programming for 30+ years. And have worked on O/S and hardware platforms that no longer exist (thank goodness!). I've written applications in many dialects of Pascal (many of which also no longer exist), as well as Fortran, Lisp, Prolog, PL1, Java, JavaScript, HTML, ColdFusion, C, Basic, Ada, assembly and as well as other languages which are fortunately extinct. I've written various kinds of language translators, successful commercial applications, federal government applications, robot, space-shuttle and accident simulations, data manipulators, etc. None of which means anything and all of which sounds more impressive than is true in reality.\r\n"
