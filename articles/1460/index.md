Free Software Magazine is all about Free Software. We have published more than 250 articles, ALL under free licenses.

Our web site has matured and is achieving a large amount of traffic, and the magazine is reaching a very large audience: now, it's time for us to decide our marketing strategy for selling ads.

We believe that it is the community who should benefit from the ads—as well as the magazine. So, this is our offer to the free software community: we will pay 20% commission for every ad sold to a company by ANY member of the free software community. Here are the simple rules:


* Any community member that makes a successful sale will get a 20% commission from the sale
* Each commission is enforced for a maximum of 4 issues. This means that if a company buys 5 ads to be published in 5 issues, the community member will get a 20% commission for the first 4 published ads only.
* We reserve the right to refuse ads from ethically questionable companies. For example: Microsoft, gambling or porn companies, etc.

The tariffs are incredibly simple—they are in the media kit, available [here](/advertise).

Could this become a full time job for you? Maybe, in time. For now, it could be a great way to earn some cash while helping a fantastic free software project.

Free Software Magazine exists thanks to the community, and I am confident that it will survive thanks to the community's commitment and skills.

Thank you!

Tony Mobily
