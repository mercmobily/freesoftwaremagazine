  The [IcedTea](http://icedtea.classpath.org/wiki/Main_Page)  project has been launched  by [GNU  Classpath](http://www.gnu.org/software/classpath/).  It's goal is to make Sun's recently freed Java  implementation,  called [OpenJDK](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenJDK),  work in free software environments.  This involves replacing some  binary blobs with code from GNU Classpath, and making or adapting a  free software build system for OpenJDK.

  As [the  announcement](http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.java.openjdk.distro-packaging.devel/5) says, it's just in the experimental stages, but  it's great to see progress being made through the collaboration of  Sun and the free software community.

  In other  news, [Xandros](http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20070604183519938)  and [LG Electronics](http://lwn.net/Articles/237245/)  have signed patent deals with Microsoft for the privilege of  distributing free software.  That MS are rushing these deals out the  door before [GPLv3](http://fsfeurope.org/projects/gplv3/)  comes into usage could be a sign that they don't have much  confidence in getting more of these deals post-GPLv3.  The direction  the money is flowing in (not toward MS) also seems to be a sign that  [MS  does not have much confidence in it's patent claims](http://mailman.fsfeurope.org/pipermail/press-release/2007q2/000178.html).

  When GPLv3  is released at the end of June, these companies will have to  disclaim those deals if they want to distribute future versions of  software that moves to GPLv3 (such as all GNU projects).  So these  deals will be exposed as useless and MS's patent claims will be  undermined by their refusal to go to court or even detail which  patents are infringed.

  Meanwhile, this week, Slashdot ran yet another "Stallman is  splitting the community" article (it seems the next round of the  [anti-GPLv3  campaign has started](http://fsfe.org/en/fellows/incinerator/weblog/anti_gplv3_campaign_has_started)).  When Slashdot is publishing this crap,  is there a place for people to get free software news and  participate in informed debate?  Bruce Perens's answer was to set  up [Technocrat](http://technocrat.net/), although it has  a science/technolgy focus rather than a free software focus.  A new  website with a free software focus  is [FSDaily](http://www.fsdaily.com/), so I wish  them luck.
