    body: "... because I'm really quite ignorant of them.\r\n\r\nIs there an EU government textbook or something that has this stuff in it!?\r\n\r\nI mean, there's a \"commission\" and a \"council\" and a \"parliament\" (which I gather, are <em>not</em> the same thing!) and there are \"MEPs\" (I do know that stands for \"Member of the European Parliament\" though I had quite a time looking it up!).\r\n\r\nWhat is the design document of the EU government? (e.g. for the US, it's the Constitution).\r\n\r\nIt all sounds terribly complex from \"across the pond\".\r\n\r\nThough, to be fair, the EU track record on corruption does not strike me as particularly worse than the US's (then again, I don't live in Europe, so maybe I'm just missing it).\r\n"
