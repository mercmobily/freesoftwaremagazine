Why do we love O'Reilly so much? It's not just new, high quality books like [Linux System Administration](http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/9780596009526/)  by Tom Adelstein and Bill Lubanovic (coming out in April). It's also the fact that they have generously offered to send the _first 10 copies off the press_ of Linux System Administration to 10 of our lucky readers! So not only will ten of our readers receive a copy of this book, they will receive _the first ten copies_ of this book! Go on, get in the running to be the envy of your friends!

Interested? You should be! Here is what you do. If want a chance to get your hands on this book, we want you to log in and post a comment (in 100 words or less) describing why your favorite piece of free software beats the alternatives hands down.

So login and comment **on this blog entry** before midnight on the 23rd of March 2007 for your chance to win.

The best ten entries will be selected by our staff and will be contacted by email at the close of the competition. You may need to turn off your spam filters. If the any winner does not respond to our email within 48 hours they will forfeit their prize and an alternative winner will be selected.
