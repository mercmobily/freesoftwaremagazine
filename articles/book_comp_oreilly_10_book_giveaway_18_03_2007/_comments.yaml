It is an ideally placed OS at a time when most computer users have been given a multitude of good reasons to wish to escape the abortionate corporate creation M$ call Vista.\r\n\r\nWhenever an alarmed M$ user complains that they are going to have to buy a new high-end machine, with four gig of ram, just so they can 'update' to Vista, I simply burn off a Kubuntu install CD and say,\r\n\r\n\"Boot up your machine with this in the slot, and your modem running, then press the 'install' icon. In fourty minutes you'll have a free operating system that will beat Vista hands down, complete with a first-class office suite, and everything else that you can imagine. It will be automatically configured to your broadband connection and ready to go. YOU WON'T HAVE TO UPDATE ANY HARDWARE OR PAY OUT ONE SINGLE CENT. It even allows you to keep your current M$ OS, as a partition, if the change makes you feel nervous. It'll work straight out of the box, and anyone who has ever used M$ will have no trouble using it straight away.\"\r\n\r\nWhat other free software OS could you confidently give to someone and make a claim like that?"

I have family members that are educators that are jubilant that students have a low-cost alternative to MS Works.  \r\n\r\nMy second pick would be Firefox.

But then I cannot forget Amarok, K3B and Easytag which I use just about daily. The simple ability to change desktops is also another great feature. KDE, Gnome and Xfce give users the ability to configure their desktop to their needs, try that in Windows.\r\n\r\nCould I call SabayonLinux a piece of software? It uses the power of Gentoo without confusing a new user (to Gentoo), and the Beryl desktop running off a Live CD is proof of Linux' superiority.\r\n\r\nI really can't choose one package as my favorite. I prefer Linux because it simply works, no fuss no muss. When was the last time you installed Windows on a machine and everything worked right out of the box? PCLinuxOS installed on my old laptop and everything worked right away, including the wireless card. \r\n\r\nI guess my favorite software (if you can it that) is: <strong>Linux</strong>"

I believe that the X window system is the one that makes this possible.\r\n\r\nIt's faster than doing things with keyboard shortcuts - so it increases productivity when copying some text around. And it does not interfere with the usual <code>ctrl+c/ctrl+v</code> actions. \r\n\r\nJust used it to paste the text here. :)"

With R and ESS it is a more flexible statistics package than SAS. Shell mode offers more power for managing files than the limited options available in Windows Explorer, and you can save a log of your work as a text file. I use Emacs in place of at least ten MS programs, and in every case it provides more features, more power, and more stability. \r\n\r\nTyler"

    body: "I'm sure that these will probable be a common answer, but Open Office and Firefox are very good open source free software. \r\n\r\nWith Firefox, the immediate advantage I found once I started using it was the tabbed browsing. Not having to have multiple browser windows open was a godsend. Free up space on my task bar (yes, semi-windows user here). The next great thing is the extensions. There are so many of them available. You can get them to check email, assist w/ web design/development, run custom scripts, view link/page in IE (as a last resort, hee hee). A wonderful piece of software. Oh, and of course, it's multi-platform.\r\n\r\nWith Open Office, you get a free version of Microsoft Office. While it's true that there can be some formatting issues, when opening an M.Office document with O.Office, but for the most part I don't have too many problems. Oh, and did you catch that last statement? You can open M.Office documents in O.Office, and save in the formats of M.Office too. Great for if you have to work with Clients still use M.Office. Exporting to PDF as well, out of the box, is also great. This software also being multi-platform gives it another leg up on being a great piece of free software.\r\n\r\nThose are the two big ones for me, I use them everyday and home and at work. At work I also use Thunderbird, a free email application (from the makers of Firefox), and have been getting around to learning The GIMP (like Photoship). And of course, finally, there's linux. I've been also messing around w/ various distro's and it's great as well.\r\n\r\nThank you so much to all of the developers (et al) who put so much hard work and effort into building and maintaining these pieces of software."

No more waiting to afford the next texturing course, but hands on experience so we can contribute sooner.\r\n\r\nNot only is Blender free software, it is free education."
