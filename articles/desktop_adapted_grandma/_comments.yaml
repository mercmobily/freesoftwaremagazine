    body: "Thanks for the articles you linked to. My Mom might also be called a \"silver surfer\" (nice coinage, BTW), although she's been using computers almost as long as I have, so I didn't have so much to worry about with teaching it to her (more often it was a matter of her being frustrated at Excel features which were missing in Gnumeric, etc -- sadly she's still hooked on Windows apps for some tasks).\r\n\r\nRegarding screens for far-sightedness (I'm old enough now to start noticing this problem myself, BTW), please note that it is the absolute size of the fonts and icons that matters, not the resolution. On a small monitor, setting the size really high can be quite limiting, and these days large LCD flat panel monitors are pretty cheap. My Mom now uses a _30-inch_ widescreen monitor which seems really huge to me, but it means that even with large fonts, she can get a fairly large amount of stuff on screen at once. This cost her something like $300, IIRC -- which is about what a new 12\" CRT cost when I started computing! It's worth considering.\r\n\r\nI tried to set up SSH access, but was stymied by the problem of accessing her system. We tried to get static IP, but it's just not available where she lives. So now she's on a variable IP satellite service.\r\n\r\nIs it possible to set such a machine up so I can remote access it by SSH? How would you do it?\r\n"

I use a dynamic IP service, the client software is in stock Debian, when my dad's machine connects it automatically updates the dynamic DNS and I can SSH in when I want.\r\n\r\nObviously the SSH settings need to be carefully set to keep script kiddies out, but that's all straight forward - turn off passwords for a start!\r\n\r\n-- \r\nIt's not magic, it's work!"
