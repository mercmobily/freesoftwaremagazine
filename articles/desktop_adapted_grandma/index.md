Someone in my LUG posted this last week:

It's a great example why most IT instruction
and use fails miserably. People are not taught
useful things in a way they can understand and
use. Most of the time people are badly taught
something that is not useful and then expected
to make sense of a complex and badly designed tool.
No wonder most of the time people fail.


If people are properly taught how to do something
useful and given appropriate tools they do on
the whole find it much easier! In this case Grandma
managed to get on with Linux having failed miserably
with Windows...

This is something I have been going on about for a
while...
