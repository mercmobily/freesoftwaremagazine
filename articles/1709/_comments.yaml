And then your doctor has to update it everytime you go and you can't get it wet, or fall off, or get damaged, or ... on and on. \r\n\r\nI'd still prefer a solid backup. The best backup I can think of is a complete medical history on file, available and accessible 24/7 in a central (secure and backed up) database. This data should never be held by a license that could in anyway prevent or delay access... EVER. It should also be available in an open format so that every piece of software in every doctors surgery, lab or hospital can read it, and so that if I move country my data is still accessible and readable.\r\n\r\nThis is an ideal situation and might not be easily achievable (at least not in the near future) what with all the regulatory redtape and different stake holders needing to agree on a solution. However, I'd still prefer steps be taken to head in that direction."

Intracare is the landlord of a popular medical office park in Anytown, PA. When some doctors balked at a drastic increase in their annual lease, they were cut off from accessing their own offices.\r\n\r\nThis situation is completely unconscionable. There can be no truly open doctor-patient relationship when doctors can contract with an unrelated third party as the de facto owner of and gatekeeper to their physical location.\"\r\n\r\nOr you could substitute computers, cars, cell-phones...software and data storage are useful things that people often PAY FOR. I'm not opposed to them selecting open-source solutions if that what they prefer...but if they make a bad choice that is *their* responsibility. Ask your doctor what software they use, and if you don't like their choice, switch healthcare providers."

The information contained in those files does not belong to the proprietary vendor, and the end user should be able to easily take their dollars and info. elsewhere if the vendor is essentially extorting them because they have a monopoly.\r\n\r\nI wonder if the programmers of the GPL'd med systems have given any thought to making an attempt at reverse-engineering some of these proprietary databases for compatibility?"

In such a situation where there is no access whatsoever to the data, the company responsible for hosting the data would be liable not only for data theft, but also for not helping a person in a perilous situation...\r\n\r\nWhile doctors should indeed read their software support contracts more closely, they should retain legible access to their patients' files even after software support goes bye-bye.\r\n\r\nIt is also unfair to tie software use to technical support: if you paid for your software licence but decide to deal with bugs, breakdowns and updates on your own, that's your problem. Would you consider it fair that your refusal to pay a plumber every month to keep your pipes nice and tidy (even if the plumber actually does nothing because you did all your repairs yourself) would result in your water supply being cut? No. HEre is the very same situation taking place."

I fear that seeing it happening somewhere over the world is just a matter of time.\r\n\r\nI witnessed something comparable several years ago, while I was working in a university hospital. This one was managing an official emergency call desk for emergencies and ambulancies. The call desk was (and still is) reachable through a single phone nimber. In one case, the national phone company did not integrate correctly the periodic payment they received, and a fairly low level employee decided to cut this emergency line which is handling cases of life an death! By chance, the problem was detected very quickly and it was quickly fixed. Later there was a serious explanation, behind the scene, between the hospital and the phone line.\r\n\r\nSo, even if the scenario you propose could be considered as data theft, at least according to the continental law system, it is likely to happen, just because of uncompetent and unsensitive clerks.\r\n\r\nIt is even likelier to happen as doctors are neither lawyers nor computer sciencists, most still consider computers as an unavoidable chore and they are very unlikely to understand the need and the subtleties of an extensive sevice level agreement with their provider.\r\n\r\nIMO, the only way to avoid this problem are some very strong legislative measures, which would force service providers to:\r\n\r\n_ Register medical file services (so that no medical data could be placed somewhere else)\r\n\r\n_ Guarantee the strict protection of the privacy of medical datas (in any circumstance) and to guarantee read access to their data 24H/24 7days/7 to their clients, even in case of contract break, at least for a period of several weeks/months, \r\n\r\n_ In the case of contract interruption, the delivery of their data to the client on a media and in a format agreed by the client.\r\n\r\nI am not sure that there will be many interested providers.\r\n\r\nMarie-NoÃƒÂ«lle Baechler\r\nBelmont-sur-lausanne / Suisse\r\n"

However, they have strong motivations to cooperate, and since the code itself is free to share, any sufficiently good idea will be incorporated into multiple packages.\r\n\r\nThis is particularly true at the data storage level -- projects with any kind of maturity will usually have interchangeable or at least importable/exportable data formats.
