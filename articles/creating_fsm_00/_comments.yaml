In the future, I am sure Gianluca will honour us with a paper on how he created the LaTeX class for FSM' !\r\n\r\nSo, I imagine you have some script which converts the xml stuff to the .tex document body ? I do many LaTeX-related work but for such a magazine style work, I thought you'd go the DTP way (say Scribus). I was quite amazed to see you used LaTeX.\r\n\r\nBTW, do you include raster images or vector graphics ?\r\n\r\n________________________\r\nLet's go party."
