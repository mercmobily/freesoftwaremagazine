    body: 'This is a great book. It''s small enough you can give it a quick read while on an airplane, then go back play with the examples when you are in front of a computer. I had very little experience while packet analysis before reading this book, and by no means am I a master at it now, but I do feel I understand enough to know what traffic is moving on my network. I would give this book 4 stars, it was great.'

As always  , it seems I am trying to learn and use software at the same time so walk-thru examples are always a plus.'
