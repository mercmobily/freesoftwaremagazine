While raid 5 is great for makeing one large disk with smaller disks.  You are screwed when there is a major failer.  Perhaps you should think about a mirrored raid.  Yeah you loos a lot of space, but one desaster and it is paid for. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou brought up NTFS partition in you article. Another reason for me to hate windows crash recovery.  I have yet to see a good disk recovery.  Like the one I use in Unix but this is not the place to spam it and it is not free. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr/>\r\n\r\n"

    body: "I see there were some comments posted.... I think I replied to some in due time, but I'm not so sure... my memory sucks.\r\n\r\nI can see there were some people talking about getting new hardware. Of course, that's one answer to the problem.... but when you are working on a public institution (in Venezuela, should I add) things are not that simple here (are they anywhere?). We have to work on a very very <strong>very</strong> tight budget and crack our heads to get the most out of everything we have at hands (even dyno-hardware).\r\n\r\nNo, the practice wasn't affected for that long. The main system of the hospital (though it was affected) was restored in basically no time. The data that was affected was \"Users' Docs\". Users had local copies of documents... but perhaps not all documents... and certainly not old documents. They carried on with what they had at hand at the time and waited for us to (hopefully) get the whole think back.\r\n\r\nComing to a more technical side of the article: how did I (we) determine the order of the disks? That took a little binary math to achieve. When we studied the images we noticed that there were <cite>markers</cite> that could be read in fixed positions in different chunks of the image of the disks (things like the string \"FILE*\" that were part of the structure of the NTFS partition). There were 5 disks in the array. For every chunk \"row\", 4 of them would have data and one disk would have the XOR checksum of the other 4 chunks (remember that checksums are spread among all the disks). If you calculate the XOR of 4 times the same value (like <strong>FILE*</strong>) you will get a beautiful 0 (for each byte), and so we were able to see were the data chunks and checksum chunks were (luckily there were 5 disks. Had they been an even number of disks, it would have taken a little more trickery because the XOR of an odd number of times of \"FILE*\" would be \"FILE*\"). We already knew where the partition table of the disk was (so the first data chuck) and could see where <strong>that</strong> image had its first checksum chunk, together with the position of the other checksums in the other disks, you can know which algorithm was applied and the order of the disks. I'm wondering if that was clear enough. :-? If you have questions, ask Tony for my email address. I'm sure he will kindly provide it. ;-)\r\n\r\nThe source code? It's there, right? It's a Free Software Magazine after all, isn't it? ;-)\r\n\r\nCheers!"

    body: "Hey man nice article. I was looking for abit of advice, if possible.\r\n\r\nI have a 3 disk hardware raid 5 that has collapsed. The backup was incomplete :) so I have been asked to recover it. With abit of messing around with the hardware I have 2 full disk images and 1 half disk image. What I need advice with is determining the chuck size and algorithm. I had a go rebuilding the 3rd drive myself with left-sync and 512k chunk size then compared what I got with the partial image. I found 50k-ish chunks of identical data in identical locations but the rest was junk. Then I saw this article, what should I be looking for to determine chunk size? what should I be looking for to determine the algorithm?\r\n\r\nWould it be worth my time to create the first say 200M of the third disk with your script (using a variety of variables) and compare to the other disk I have? \r\n\r\nI am of course working in knoppix.\r\n\r\nCheers\r\nShane "
