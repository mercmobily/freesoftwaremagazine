    body: "> Microsoft had little choice but to change its stance and do something better than sponsor a half-baked OOXML-ODF converter based on XSLT, especially now that Sun has revised its ODF plug-in (which will still be supported).\r\n\r\nStill, it's pretty big news for Microsoft to behave rationally around anything open or free. Most of the time, it's like their motto is \"Always be evil\" -- most of the time, they can't seem to behave decently, even when it would clearly be in their best interest to do so.\r\n\r\nNot least because now they're in a situation where if they try to do anything decent, everybody just starts looking for the knife. Talk about a loss of trust!\r\n\r\nI've thought for a long time that such \"we must cheat to win\" thinking is the clearest indication that the MS management doesn't believe in their own company's abilities.\r\n\r\nIf that's changing, it's a welcome change (albeit awfully darned late).\r\n\r\nIt'll be interesting to see if they actually follow through on this promise."
