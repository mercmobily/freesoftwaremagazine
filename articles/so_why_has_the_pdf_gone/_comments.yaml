The reasons for this were a) I don't like reading a lot of articles at one time on my screen because of eye-strain b) I prefer to read articles at a later time from going thru my emails c) I can take my time and leave and return easily d) I can save articles to be read and referenced on a more timely occasion e) I can read the articles when I am in the mood especially if the articles are (as FSM's so, unfortunately, frequently are) ... um, less than compelling e) I can include them in my informal personal reference library of sorts.\r\nAll that having been said, I DO have other e-zines that are strictly that and have no Print-format component. They do tend to avoid referencing themselves as a Magazine per se, but since they are usually built upon a wiki-model they are easy to refer to.\r\nIf FSM is to continue Print-less, I hope it will continue its evolution towards a more web-only paradigm - particularly as far as content presentation is concerned. Hopefully I have been clear while not unnecessarily wordy, and constructively helpful, though brief.\r\nBest of Luck in your new direction."

So a not so good looking PDF-version of Magazine (with ads) is much, much better than no easy way of geting whole magazine in one sweep.

At the end of the day you read the PDF via your screen or you read the HTML via your screen - what's the difference?.  If you want hard copy of a particular article (and I would contend that most readers only want hard copy of one or two articles not the whole issue) then its much better (and cheaper) to print from your new \"Printer friendly version\" than from a PDF.  If I want to keep a particular article I either copy the HTML page or use a PDF printer to make my own PDF version.\r\n\r\nIn an earlier response I said that the only issue I see with the HTML format is that you keep an <strong>easy to access archive</strong>.

So I'd like to request a thing in the middle between PDFs suitable for a publisher and no PDFs: Maybe you can use some transformation (XML/XSL?) to convert HTML to a PDF (with a number of pages non multiple of 16)? (Why do you want to keep this rule of multiples of 16 pages if you publish online only?)\r\n\r\nhtmldoc was already mentioned, maybe thats the direction?\r\n\r\nIf you disagree, please tell me how to take an HTML issue with me (please don't say 'wwwoffle')...\r\n\r\nEugen\r\n--\r\nhttp://euneuber.googlepages.com/"

So i guesh you ain't considering a solution, atleast not for the current issue. Can it be that hard to make a zipped version of a print ready version of the html version of the magazine ??? Aren't your readers worth the small effort asked here ???\r\n\r\nOkay i know some comments offered here was very negative & those subscribers don't really deserve such an effort BUT was my comments negative , didn't i bring you an easy solution & a few examples of it & was i the only positive comment ? I think not, please i plead again for an offline version.\r\n\r\nPlease don't see this as a treath or as a negative comment but i really think an online only edition would make me less intrested in the magazine & would probably only do the effort of creating an offline html myself if the article is Mac related & skipp the other article's even though the *nix open source articles are usefull for me aswell but in that case i'dd probably get my information on those apps through other channels as your channel obviously isn't the easiest way anymore to get it.\r\n\r\nI hope you bring os some sort of offline version soon , thx"

It was very interesting for me. I would make a donation, but I didn't know your problems. Sorry and thanks again."

On the other hand making such a change without consulting your reader community or seeking their help reeks of less than honest motives. It is pretty clear what this is all about. It is about CONTROL. It is about getting more people to frequently access your web site which will attract more popups and other commercial crap. What was the point in creating a new magazine when linuxgazette (.net) was around for much longer and could use your help. No, that was not good enough. You had to show them how to make a real magzine in a jazzy  \r\nPDF. And now you REALLY showed them. Ah yes there is new theory in town \"Paper is dead\". Do you have any data for this ? Or is this your \"know it all\" opinion. Don't you think it is hipocracy trying to create a \"free software mazagine\" and then going against the very grain of the \"free software model\" of depending on the community and giving them the democratic CONTROL on such significant decisions.

Your opinion about Tony's opinion is just an opinion. But, while his was not attacking you, your one is attacking him. That does not make you a) right, b) clever, or c) worth listening to. There were no lies. There was only opinion. We (FSM) and others in the online magazine industry can't afford to keep producing PDFs... because no one is willing to pay for them. Therefore, to us, PDF is a dead format and HTML is very alive. Tony tip-toed around certain issues, in order to be sensitive to certain parties, and had limited space in which to get his message across... this does not make him a liar. \r\n\r\n<cite>You deserved the responses you received, and I'm sure you will continue to receive them for some time, despite your perfectly rational explanation on your blog.</cite>\r\n\r\nWhy? We didn't take away anything that a) belonged to you, b) you deserved, c) you earned, or d) you paid for. But despite that, so far we have received pleads, requests, demands and threats in regard to returning the PDF. We offered it for free. We did not need to. And now we don't. We are sorry for those who will miss it but you have no right to complain and we do not deserve to get some of these responses (including yours).\r\n\r\n<cite>You have a perfect opportunity to make peace with many of your disgruntled customers; you know what they are asking for, a method of printing the entire magazine for offline reading. You have been getting offers of help, and pointers to great resources to fully automate this process.</cite>\r\n\r\nFirst of all \"customers\" pay for a good or a service. Our readers get something for free. We don't have disgruntled customers. If you have the desire you can extract the HTML and convert it to PDF for printing yourself. Other people are already doing this. We won't stop you. We just aren't going to continue spending our time, and therefore money, making something that we find unrewarding in every way to make a very small percentage of our readership even more happy than they should be with the fact we give them all this information in HTML format. However, we have provided an alternative printer friendly option which also cost us in developer time and therefore money.\r\n\r\n<cite>Meanwhile I wont be returning, not because of the missing PDF, but your contempt for me as a reader. I deserve better than that, and I have better things to do with my time than to be angry at an article.</cite>\r\n\r\nIf we have contempt with you at all, it is as a commenter not as a reader. You as a reader, were quiet and pleasant to provide reading material to. You as a commenter are offensive and unreasonable. And I <strong>can</strong> also think of better things for you to be doing than posting insulting and offensive comments on our site.\r\n\r\n<cite>Good Bye.</cite>\r\n\r\n<strong>Good Bye</strong>.\r\n"

Basically you feed PrinceXML an XML file (XHTML, XML, etc) plus a CSS file or files and you can create your PDF issue straight away.  Essentially what you'd do is export your content to XML/XHTML and build the issue from that.  AListApart.com had an article [2] on using it to print an entire book with it to PDF.  It definitely looked interesting.  It's not free software, but it does allow you to wait till the last minute to create your PDF out of your content.\r\n\r\nThanks for a great magazine!\r\n\r\nShane\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] http://princexml.com/\r\n[2] http://alistapart.com/articles/boom/"

However, instead of providing a `printer-friendly' version, you could ask if some of your readers are willing to format at least some of the articles in a nicer form. After all, TeX makes it pretty easy. This way, the most popular articles will get the attention they deserve. I myself am not a big fan of .pdf but only because it is a bad standard, however, some form of typographically correct output is preferrable to none (there are no truly open page standards at the time if one does not count .dvi and .djvu or OO XML junk). Reading stuff on the computer screen is just too painful, and clicking `next' after every page is even more so. Also, it would be nice if the fact that\r\n\r\nTHIS MAGAZINE IS AN HTML PUBLICATION ONLY (AT LEAST FOR NOW), NO DOWNLOADABLE FORMAT (SUCH AS PDF) IS AVAILABLE\r\n\r\nis prominently displayed somewhere on the front page, so that everybody knows what to expect.
