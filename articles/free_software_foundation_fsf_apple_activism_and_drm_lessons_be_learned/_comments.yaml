    body: "\"The arguments to pitch GNU/Linux to the average end user are different to those needed to sell it to businesses where the bottom line is cost and profit. Many free software advocates do this very well\"\r\n\r\nAbsolutely agree with the first sentence. Does \"this\" in the second sentence apply to arguments for end users or arguments for businesses?\r\n\r\nGreg Knittl"

But the FSF does not launch these campaigns because they're easy, but \"because they are hard, [...] because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to win.\"\r\n\r\nIn other words, the FSF will keep fighting the good fight because no one else will.  BadVista and Defective by Design are important parts of that, and I believe they're on the right track."

    body: "The truth is that demonstrations in and in front of stores are not really for the benefit of the salespeople, but for the customers. I think the point of such demonstrations _is_ to raise awareness among customers.\r\n\r\nI don't know how successful it is at doing that, but the idea is basically sound. The problem is this: how else can you get through to those customers? If you launch a campaign on the internet, you're only reaching a small, technically-literate audience -- missing most of the people who are supporting these \"lock-down\" business models. So how else can you address the general public? TV commercials would work of course, but they are very expensive. Radio spots are cheaper, but you'd need a lot more of them. And so on.\r\n\r\n\"Making a scene\" at the place of sale not only communicates directly with customers there, but may, if the scene is big enough or interesting enough, attract press coverage that will get you those kinds of exposure for free. And yes, of course, these are exactly the tactics of a political movement. But that's what the FSF  is waging with the DbD and BadVista campaigns."
