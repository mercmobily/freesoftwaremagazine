Many of the MySQL team use IBM computers by preference to do their developing on; and I know that, for some, a lot of the reason was the support for Linux. 

Now Lenovo owns IBM's hardware business, but it seems [they are dropping support for Linux](http://hardware.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=06/06/04/0415221&from=rss) (that's a Slashdot link, because, as always, the comments are as interesting as the story).

Again, this is one of those disturbing little pieces of news. Not because Lenovo are not supporting Linux, but because, as one of the commenters at Slashdot points out, Microsoft will get paid for each license on each Lenovo machine whether or not users actually run Windows on it. This is, apparently, how it works in a free market economy.
