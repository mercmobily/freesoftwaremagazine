Over the years, the marketing and advertising strategies employed by businesses—both small and large alike—have changed dramatically. What once used to be traditional advertising on a black-and-white television has since evolved into elaborate online guerilla marketing campaigns, sometimes costing several thousand dollars a month.  With computer software being a relatively new (and I use that term lightly) advancement, the marketing strategies employed by software distributors has largely been based on the web.

Even energy companies have been embracing it (see [Ambit Energy reviews](http://www.businessforhome.org/2012/04/ambit-energy-review-2012/), where you can also see information about Ambit Energy Power Company).

Regardless of the product, marketing tactic or the budget, the desired outcome remains the same; attract attention, increase exposure, and brand-strengthening. One marketing strategy in particular is widely used, but seldom talked about. That strategy is referred to as multi-level marketing or MLM. Unfortunately, multi-level marketing has been given a bad name because it is often employed by sketchy folks operating pyramid schemes. However, when employed as a legitimate business strategy, multi-level marketing can be quite effective.

Is it possible to apply multi level marketing principles to free software?

# What about free software?

Someone, somewhere in the IT department, knows how much time spends to make things work.

Today, in 2015, the question remains: as an open source project, what is it that you give them back? The answer has been there all along: it's the _advantages they get by using free software_.

In effects, multi-level marketing is _already_ happening in the free software world. The rewords for developing free software is in terms of exposure, experience, passion, and peer-review of your code. The "benefits" to the IT professionals in companies cannot be monetary: it is, however, there in terms of what they get out of it.
