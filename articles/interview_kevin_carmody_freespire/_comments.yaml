    body: "I often feel a little funny commenting on \"Value Added\" GNU/Linux distros like Linspire, since I'm not really in their market. I jumped ship from the proprietary computer world some time ago, and I was very much drawn to the idea of running a completely free and open system.  But then, I'm a professional user of computers, and have used a lot of different systems, so switching wasn't so painful for me as it is for a lot of novice users.\r\n\r\nOTOH, I can't find any reason to take issue with what Linspire is doing. I certainly have installed non-free components on GNU/Linux systems in order to get things like Flash or RealMedia to work. Those things were essential on my Mom's system, for example -- and they were not trivial to install on a basic Debian system. So, I imagine that Linspire is for users like my Mom, if they haven't got me to install stuff for them.\r\n\r\nIt also strikes me as odd that Linspire has been particularly singled out for criticism, when \"value add\" has been a pretty conventional idea for some time. There are a number of boxed GNU/Linux distributions that have used this approach.\r\n\r\nTo listen to the criticisms, though, I think the problem is this: a non-free GNU/Linux that skirts the bounds of the free software world, but makes things \"easy\" is a threat because it's a temptation. I think the people objecting must be like ex-smokers who get upset about smokers, not because of a genuine concern for public health, but because they tempt them to start up their addictions again.\r\n\r\nBut I feel that if you're really happy with where you're at (and I am so with free software), then it's just not so threatening.  And Carmony is, IMHO, probably correct that a successful Linspire, with many Linux desktop users would more likely be a benefit than a hazard to those of us who insist on using free GNU/Linux systems -- that kind of market pressure is useful. True, there also needs to be pressure towards free software itself, but I think there may well be enough of us to create that pressure, so there's no need to go tilting at windmills.  Linspire isn't quite playing our game, but I'm having a hard time seeing them as rivals or enemies.\r\n\r\nEnderle's articles are pretty scary though: \"open source will kill innovation\". I think it's the result of a fundamental fallacy, based on the tired assumption that innovation correlates with monetary reward. Free software development models have, IMHO, already proven that's false. Money helps, but free communication helps more.\r\n"

    body: 'You actually have to think of Linspire the same way that we think of AOL.  It is geared towards people who want to sit down at their computers and just have everything work.  They really don''t want to tinker with things unless they are just making something look "prettier".  Let''s face it AOL didn''t actually hurt the Internet.  By putting more users onto the Internet they forced companies to think of how to sell things to THOSE users.  AOL gave access to the Internet to the people that can''t program their vcrs.  Linspire is simply packaging things so that those same kinds of people can use Linux.  I admit I don''t like having to pay a subscription fee to be able to download programs that are free everywhere BUT if I know for a fact that those programs are going to work WITHOUT  hassles I might even be so inclined.  So I guess I have to say Terry, you are soooooo right!  Linspire is a threat to those of us who love to tinker because sometimes after a long day of work or worse, in a panic because we have a deadline, we just want everything to work with no hassles.  Linspire is also necessary, like AOL, to get the numbers of people onto it higher to help force the market to develop for Linux as well or even exclusively for that matter.  I recently installed Linspire but I did not do any research so I did not know that it was geared towards the desktop user.  Who knows, maybe it will do exactly what I want it to do but if not Fedora is still calling my name...'

    body: "No?\r\nReally?\r\nAre you sure?\r\nPersonally, I am in awe of such an intellect who can state the obvious and then get knobbed because he was such a genius.\r\n\r\nCarmony wanted people to call him a nut in one of this online blurbs.\r\nSo here goes: \"Grade A peanut head\".\r\n\r\nA guy who makes people as uncomfortable as Carmony does NOT make such missteps tryin to be hip and cute. Sort of like Kobe Bryant should NEVER do a SNL sketch about a panty raid. When youre sketchy, you cant afford to.\r\n\r\nSo far, Carmony went from amusing slick talking snakeoil salesman to a guy I'd rather not trust.\r\nAs one of our techs said: \"He has all the charisma and believability of Tom Cruise\".\r\n\r\nAnd that use of the free speech argument is just precious. Im surprised he didnt say that the ones who are opposed hate america because most of Carmony's putdowns remind me of Stephen Colbert's character.\r\n\r\nI dont think there is anything dark and sinister about Enderle's endorsement by Carmony, just amazement that a con man can be so stupid as to needlessly make himself enemies over a hack who brings nothing to the table. There are some names out there, none in the tech media, that you can  take a chance with angering some people because they bring some insight but Enderle has proved throughout the years that he has trouble differentiating concepts like open source and open standards and well: his articles speak for himself.\r\n\r\nThat said, Carmony is a much better writer and speaker than Enderle. He knows all the little tricks, red herrings, misdirections (\"See, he does know Linux,he said its not used on the desktop\") that are the marks of a good debater/lawyer/bulls*****r.\r\n \r\nThe majority of the time, the bulls**t works too.\r\n\r\n\r\nRich Trema"
