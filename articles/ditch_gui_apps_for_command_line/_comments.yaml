OK, not as \"complete\" as GUI browsers, but it supports SSL, frames, Javascript and most sensible graphics types. For it's graphical layer it can use X, DirectFB, framebuffer and SVGAlib."

    body: "I also use w3m. As far as I am concerned it completely obsoletes Lynx. The thing is, Lynx has always had the limitation that it does a lousy job of formatting tables, but w3m handles them easily. Most web pages, even ones that are not specially designed for text browsing, are entirely usable with w3m.\r\n\r\nw3m can also do a lot of other tricks, like correctly handling cookies, that few text browsers can do. It's also a nice paging program for on-disk browsing.\r\n\r\nI consider it an essential shell program on any system I use.\r\n\r\nNow, it's not stream-based, you do need to have curses (I don't know whether that's true of Lynx or not).\r\n"
