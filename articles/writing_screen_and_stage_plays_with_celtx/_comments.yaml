    body: "Anthony\r\n\r\nThanks for this.\r\n\r\nYou captured the lic stuff nicely. Basically, the CePL = MPL. \r\n\r\nI would have liked to upgrade the MPL with some new language, but figured people would think we were messing about. So we went with the MPL straight forward. Which is actually a derivative of the NPL, the Netscape Public Lic, where Moz came from.\r\n\r\nM "

    body: "That's great. Thanks for the article. I hadn't heard of this program before. I like the fact that it is multi-platform, as I use both Linux and Windows. Hopefully one day I'll be able to move strictly to Linux (Ubuntu perhaps), I just need to narrow down the list of \"replacement apps\" to use, so you've helped me out here.\r\n\r\n------\r\nlet's all play nice!"
