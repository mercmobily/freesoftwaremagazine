    body: " \r\nThe first time I successfully installed a Linux OS was back in 2001 with a RH7.1 install. \r\nI was thrilled, everything worked! \r\nSomehow I thought I should buy the RH7.1 box, my brainwashed mind believed it would be a \"better\" version then. To my big surprise it was exactly the same as the downloaded version! I was stunned. The idea that I did not have to buy to get the real thing took me a while to get used to. \r\nIn my opinion its this Microsoft-brainwash whats causing most misunderstandings about free software.  \r\nIts more about retraining the mind then about minimizing barriers to enable people to make new choices.\r\n\r\nhttp://tuxicity.wordpress.com/"

All in all, the problems you listed have been the default problems faced by all Free Software evangelists.\r\nI think a Live CD is one the most effective weapons we have in this war. \r\nDemo them an OS working right out of a CD, with software doing as much as their old OS .... and more. A li'l eye-candy here, a li'l trivia there ... and I'm sure, they are bound to atleast google some more info about FS , although they might not agree on your face\r\n\r\n"

People as generally afraid of change or have no desire to learn new things (yes, I know that doesn't apply to you; that's why you're in the IT industry).\r\n\r\nBranding/marketing plays to the weeknesses and frailties of the species and most are happy to go along for the ride."

That means no more support whatsoever, unless you pay for premium support packages that extend past the deadline. This only is the case when we speak of businesses.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to home users, support mostly means updates free of charge for a period of time and not much more.\r\n\r\nFear of the unknown and feeling sheltered by the idea of being \"lemming\" 57,394,765 using the same proprietary product makes people reluctant to switch."
