I think what she has done is deplorable and I would love it if the same happened to her some day so she would understand what it means to be threatened and be unable to hide.\r\n\r\n    \r\n_______________________________________________________\r\n\r\nFrom: Anon\r\n    Url:\r\n    Date: 2005-05-13\r\n    Subject: Why Forgive?\r\n\r\n    O'Gara has shown no form of remorse for the actions that you list as vile. She still has the article up at her G2 site and it still contains the byline \"to be continued\". She has not given anyone any reason to forgive her.\r\n\r\n    Forgiveness without remorse on the part of the transgressor would indicate acceptance of the behavior. There is no way that she deserves to be forgiven without showing remorse, appologizing and asking to be forgiven. anything else condones her behavior.\r\n\r\n    Your article needs work anyway. There is no secrecy to be seen at Groklaw. Only publicly available material with comments and facts are posted there. Who publishes it makes no difference.\r\n\r\n    If O'Gara does not like Groklaw, she could try refuting what is posted there. Since she apparently was unable to do so, she went into personal attack mode.\r\n\r\n    The one thing you say is right, \"enough is enough\". So please ask O'Gara to stop now.\r\n\r\n        \r\n_______________________________________________________\r\n\r\nFrom: Tony Mobily\r\n        Url: http://www.mobily.com\r\n        Date: 2005-05-13\r\n        Subject: Maybe but...\r\n\r\n        Hi,\r\n\r\n        I don't think that it would make any difference, if I asked Maureen to stop publishing her stories on Pamela.\r\n\r\n        ALSO, I think Maureen is doing what she is doing out of anger, and doesn't fully realise what she is doing.\r\n\r\n        Now... I have to ask you a question. Could you say, about yourself, that you never ever did *anything* regrettable, out of anger, without realising the damage you were causing?\r\n\r\n        Do you not deserve forgiveness? Have you not changed since then?\r\n\r\n        The only thing we can do to help the situation, is 1) Firgive Maureen 2) Help her understand what is going on. Bashing her will only cause more anger, and more damage.\r\n\r\n        Merc.\r\n\r\n        Editor In Chief\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_______________________________________________________\r\n\r\nFrom: ruurd\r\nUrl:\r\nDate: 2005-05-13\r\nSubject: Fogiving requires repenting\r\n\r\nI'd be most happy to. Provided that Maureen O'Gara repents and repairs the harm she has done. In public. Just as public as the way she inflicted the damage in the first place.\r\n\r\n    \r\n_______________________________________________________\r\n\r\nFrom: Tony Mobily\r\n    Url: http://www.mobily.com\r\n    Date: 2005-05-13\r\n    Subject: Forgiveness doesn't require anything!\r\n\r\n    Hi Ruurd,\r\n\r\n    I know what you mean. But... well, it's easy to forgive if you are given something in exchange! That's sort-of barter, isn't it?\r\n\r\n    If you forgive somebody, you do it inconditionally. You forgive her even if she continues to write what she writes. If anything, you feel for her because she is living a life that leeds her to harm other people - and therefore herself - over and over again.\r\n\r\n    You know what? I would like to go further. I would like to be able to _love_ Maureen O'Gara, regardless of her actions. Love her as a living being who was born, who grew up, had close friends, laughed, ate, loved, and so on. Maureen - just like PJ - is not just a name of a web page. And is not a person able to *just* harm PJ - she does a lot more things, and a lot of them are probably full of love and beauty.\r\n\r\n    Maureen suffers every time somebody threatens her, just like any of us do. And the argument \"she deserves it\" doesn't work, because nobody should have the power to decide who deserves what.\r\n\r\n    Besides... if I knew the _worst_ things you have done, what would I think of you? What would you deserve, to my eyes?\r\n\r\n    Just as Maureen didn't (doesn't?) know how much damage she inflicted to PJ, those people writing death threats to Maureen didn't (don't?) know how much suffering they were causing to Maureen.\r\n\r\n    Do you thing it's easy to forgive them, for Maureen?\r\n\r\n    Merc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_______________________________________________________\r\n\r\nFrom: Bruce McGee\r\nUrl:\r\nDate: 2005-05-13\r\nSubject: Forgiveness\r\n\r\nFair enough. Everyone deserves this, don't they?\r\n\r\nBut this doesn't affect her accountability. Whatever her motivations, Maureen was clearly in the wrong. She is solely responsible for and fully deserving of any business, legal and personal repercussions she experiences. And depending on the fallout, \"criminal\" might be added to that list.\r\n\r\nForgiveness? Sure. Sympathy? None.\r\n\r\n\r\n_______________________________________________________\r\n\r\nFrom: cooluke\r\nUrl:\r\nDate: 2005-05-13\r\nSubject: Forgive MOG?\r\n\r\nI suspect PJ will forgive mog; based on having read her blog for a couple of years, and what mog revealed about her. I suspect that that is just PJ. Having her (mog's) bylines pulled is the minimum deserved punishment. You ask others to forgive, and I am sympathetic to that request. However, you have to remember: 1) PJ's opposition doesn't understand the 'new' ground rules: they are playing 'hard-ball' with someone not in the game. 2) Given the uneven landscape of the 'conflict' ('powerful' type A personalities used to winning at any cost utilizing any means vs. a quiet, unassumming blogger simply putting forth facts (and correcting mistakes quickly to maintain a fact-based blog), with a community of similarly-oriented followers). With out Groklaw, SCO's ploy (whatever it was) may have worked; certainly no one outside the legal system would know what was going on. MOG tried to influence the 'debate' by attempting to destroy the blog's creator and maintainer. She put forth no facts relating to the SCO case; merely a character-assination attempt. From her superior and arrogant (and let's face it - just dead wrong) vantage has tried to manipulate the 'news'.\r\n\r\nAs I said earlier, she is lucky that PJ was her target - I suspect that forgiveness will (or has) follow(ed). I withhold that forgiveness, however, until her punishment is complete: the beginning of which requires a heart-felt apology. How about it mog? Do you have the decency to apologize? Do you have the character to admit that what you did was wrong? I may not be alone, and I'm waiting."
