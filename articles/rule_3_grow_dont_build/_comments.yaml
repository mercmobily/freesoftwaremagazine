    body: "Thanks for the kind words. It's always satisfying to know somebody is getting something out of what I'm writing.\r\n\r\nAs for getting caught by this rule, you're certainly not alone: this is my number one biggest stumbling block personally. I have several projects that are just a little too large for me alone, but not workable enough at present to attract any help.\r\n\r\nWhen you find yourself in this situation, there are basically three things you can do to fix things:\r\n\r\n1) Adjust your expectations -- figure on \"toughing through\" a lot more work in isolation before you can attract any real development help\r\n\r\n2) You can break your project down and then find _independent uses_ for the pieces you need (in other words make the components into viable projects on their own). This is also an application of the previous \"rule\", \"divide and conquer\"\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n3) You can _descope_ your project. Throw out everything you don't absolutely, positively need, then develop what's left. The agile programming model calls this philosophy \"YAGNI\": \"you aren't going to need it\"\r\n\r\nOr, of course, a combination strategy: peel off all the things you can, make those that can be manged into independent projects, and brace yourself for the long haul to get the remaining core project finished.\r\n"
