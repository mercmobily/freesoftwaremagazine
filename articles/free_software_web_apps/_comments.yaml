    body: "From the user perspective, I see software more as a service rather than some lines of code. If I'm for example using a filter in GIMP, the programmer offers me a service in sharing his knowledge of how to change an image. If you are using a webapp like GMail or Google Maps or whatever, then you are using clearly a service too. \r\nIt's all about the knowledge which is in the code and that gives me power to do the things I want (whether this is to transform a picture or send an E-Mail via a protocol I don't bother to learn). And I think it's very important that this knowledge and the skills burried in the code are open for everybody to see and improve upon. Thus, it doesn't matter where the code is executed. If I'm using a service I want to be able to find out how exactly that service works. \r\n\r\nSo, I think in the next revision of the GPL it ought better be talked about \"distributing services which are provided through means of computer code\", rather than \"distributing code and binaries\". That way the GPL would be better appliable for webapps to protect the freedoms for all users. Some company couldn't then take any of those nice apps described in your article, modify them and run them on their server, without sharing the changes they made to the core code, with the excuse that they aren't really distributing software. It's a pitty that we're probably too late to include this in GPLv3 ;-)"

I agree that they _ought_ to distribute the changes, but they shouldn''t be _forced_ to if the developers say that it''s ok for them not to (through their choice of license).  You should check out the Affero GPL if you''re writing a webapp and you think it''s better for the purpose.'

    body: "I agree that web applications pose interesting licensing questions. But I don't get why having the source code facilitates moving from Google to Yahoo.\r\n\r\nWouldn't I have to run the software <strong>on their</strong> servers to be able to get at my stored e-mails, or to enter my e-mails into my new Yahoo inbox? If the client code can do that, fine--I can see the code. If I have to send an SQL query to Yahoo's database, I can't do that from outside their network, regardless of whether I have their code.\r\n\r\nWhat am I missing?\r\n\r\n(BTW, the link to the RoundCube homepage is broken.)"

    body: "Yeah, they keep to the license. But with free software licenses it's always the same: they aren't the optimal solution because default law is copyright,not copyleft. That's why they always need revisions as new dangers or possibilities arise. That's why I think their spirit and intention is just as important as their law-binding content.\r\n\r\nAnd as the GPL is THE standard license for free software it would be nice if you could still use that one. Can you incorporate GPLed code into your project and release the whole thing under the Affero GPL? Then It'd be okay."
