If they are lucky, they call a friend/family who is computer literate and let them try to handle the mess.  If they are unlucky they do one of three things.\r\n\r\n1.  They take the machine to a shop to be 'fixed'.  It doesn't matter that the machine may or may not be broken, it needs to be 'fixed'.  For this privilege they end up spending a few hundred dollars.  By the time the machine is returned to them they could have a great down payment on a new machine.\r\n\r\n2.  Those few smart one's who realize that getting the machine 'fixed' is a waste of time just go out and get a new machine.    Then the process starts all over. :)\r\n\r\n3.  They just give up and do NOTHING with the computer.  They live in a world of fear.  They know the computer is hopelessly broken but they are too afraid of losing 'valuable' data (like the solitare game that came with that copy of windows) to actually let anyone fix it.\r\n\r\nNormal people hate computers.  They don't find the same joy in computing that 'geeks' do.  It's all to complicated and confusing for them.  Every task is a monumental challenge.  There is real fear to do anything new.  Once past email, word processing, internet, and solitaire the computer world is a truly frightening place.  And this is BEFORE trying to get them to run adware/virus protection.\r\n\r\nI teach computers for a living.  I'm amazed there is a computer industry sometimes.  I've been lucky enough to convince a handful of people to try linux and NONE of them have moved back to windows once they have made the full switch.  People truly want an alternative to the current computer world but they are to afraid of changing.\r\n\r\nYour article points out exaclty why.  "

It has two proprietary ISA-cards required for comunication with the HPLC. Now, the PC is about to die.\r\nGetting a PC with ISA-slots is already difficult. But unfortunately, the (you guessed it - proprietary) software does not run under Windows XP and only with difficulties under 2000. More recent mainboards do, however, not often work together with Windows NT. Windows NT is not an option as security updates are no longer provided. I was thinking about a virtual machine - but the ISA-cards prevent that. I was thinking about an ISA2USB-converter (which I found), but NT doesn't support USB. So in the end we had to buy a new network box to connect the HPLC via TCP/IP for \"only\" 2000 Euro. Note that we do not get *any* improvement from a users perspective (if not a deterioration: a network problem is far more difficult to track down) - it is all about updates (software -> security, hardware -> replace brolen parts).\r\nIf  all the stuff was written as OS we could have adapted the driver to the new machine simply by recompiling ...."

Yes, you gotta know about that trick.\r\nYou may have solved your sound problems with disabling ACPI: setting the kernel as 'Standard PC' disables the use of virtual IRQs, most often source of sound/graphics problems and BSODs with IRQ_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL.\r\nThe ext3 win32 driver works better with NT5 (Win2k) than NT5.1 (WinXP); it doesn't however work as well as under Linux (no journaling, fragmentation appears faster).\r\nSeveral softwares use 32-bit addressing to size their output; the file system as such doesn't matter much, as you've seen.\r\nNTFS isn't terra incognita for Linux anymore: a working, final, read/write driver came out a few months ago.\r\nNero has gotten huge and bloated; get CDburnerXP instead.

You're gonna need top of the line hardware just to run it efficiently.  Seriously, 1GB of RAM is no longer enough, better to have 3GB's of RAM.   There are a few things I like, for example changing \"\\Documents and Settings\" to \"\\Users\" which only makes it more Unix like.  The file search is a rip off of Mac OS X Spotlight but is a welcome addition. There are enough serious compatibility problems that Circuit City & FireDog in conjunction with Microsoft are now giving out VirtualPC with a WinXP MSIE6 or WinXP MISE7 virtual image to allow users to run the virtual machine for those applications and websites that do not work with Vista yet.\r\n\r\nYour experience is far from unusual even with using the very old Win2k \"legal\" installation.  i.e. I've seen it all.  I have to jump through virtual flaming hoops of fire every single day just to accomplish basic tasks.

Latest build even has Intel Mac support.  \r\n\r\n2. BartPE - Bootable CD mini-WinXP on a RAM disk.  Fantastic for booting a dead system or to get access to the hard disk and have a network connection for backup, etc. .  BartPE is a clone of WinPE on steroids.  It's much better then WinPE and is free.  It comes with a utility to customize your boot cd with the tools of choice.  Ton's of plugin tools available, some free some not.  It does require having a legal copy of WinXP. \r\n\r\n3. DBAN - Derrick's Boot & Nuke - Fantastic secure disk wipe tool.   Available as a bootable CD ISO or even a floppy image.  Supports DoD 7 Pass wipe and greater. \r\n\r\nI wish there were more tools of this caliber that were either free or completely open source.  I've got my little bag of tricks which contains a whole lot more but much of it is neither free nor cheap.  "
