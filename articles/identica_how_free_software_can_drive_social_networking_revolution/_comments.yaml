Nor for that matter do I feel the need to follow the equally meaningless twitterings of everyone else who regularly indulges themselves and says nothing."

    body: "There is a sense of irony in posting about people who have nothing to say while saying not much at all yourself. Additionally I've long believed that those who claim\" not to be so arrogant\" are generally exhibiting some arrogance in their own stance. ;o)\r\n\r\nJoking aside, yes it's true there is a high signal to noise ratio on micro-blogging sites but there's definitely more signal on the identi.ca side -- particularly in the groups. I regularly see more requests for help and responses to them within Identi.ca groups. So whilst micro-blogging everytime you get on or off the bus may be excessive, denting for help on a bash alias command is entirely useful when you get three instant responses and trigger a useful discussion on the merits of bash functions with links (as happened today on Identi.ca's \\!linux group).\r\n\r\nFinally my question was really aimed at those free software advocates who already use Twitter and it probably should have said so. Sorry - here's a rewrite:\r\n\r\n> So here’s a final question for you as a free software supporter _on Twitter_: do you have an _Identi.ca_ account yet?\r\n\r\nthanks for the comment though\r\nRyan\r\n--\r\nEquitas IT Solutions - fairness, quality, freedom\r\nhttp://www.equitasit.co.uk"
