    body: "I was there at the IBM conference in Paris when the poor unfortunate stood up and said words to the effect of \"We've taken the STEP standard, and we've improved it!\". I was there when practically the entire audience at that talk we're on their feet shouting that they didn't want IBM's version of the standard, they just wanted a standard, just one, just a single standard. I was there when IBM got the message loud and clear that their clientelle were sick and tired of merely being regarded as a cash cow, they didn't listen. A few months later IBM nearly ceased to be a viable organisation, mainly because of the arrogant stance taken with their own customers. IBM had to learn the hard way that you dictate terms to your customers at your peril. Maybe Big Blue is merely trying to prevent Microsoft from entering a world of pain by taking their stance against OpenXML because they have learnt a lesson from the past and can see that what microsoft is doing is wrong, and that they will pay the price unless they moderate their corporate behaviour.\r\n\r\nFor the uninitiated STEP stands for \"STandard for the Exchange of Product model data\" i.e. CAD files.\r\n\r\nPaul"

    body: "Once upon a time, there was a simple, relatively \"open\" Local Area Network specification and protocol that was being implemented by many early adaptors.  That protocol was called \"ethernet.\"\r\n\r\nBut IBM didn't want to use ethernet.  Rather, they came to the table late, and pressed very hard for a much more complex technology called token-ring.  They said it offered many advantages, that customers wanted it.  But for a long time, IBM was the only source for the complex chipsets required to build a token ring adapter. Eventually TI came out with a token ring chip set, but it remained much more complex and costly than equivalent ethernet chipsets.\r\n\r\nMany IBM customers would only adapt token-ring, because IBM said it was best.  Some even removed ethernet infrastructures and replaced them the TR.\r\n\r\nAs time went by, ethernet adapter prices fell dramatically.  But not token-ring adapters.  The supposed token-ring advantages failed to materialize.  Indeed, the token-ring LAN system turned out to have unexpected problems and limitations.  Larger token-ring rings failed in unexpected and very difficult to diagnose ways, as workstations entered and then left the ring.  Larger rings proved to be exponentially less reliable than smaller rings.  Soon, customers that had removed ethernets to install token-rings were doing the opposite.\r\n\r\nI find the present ODF / \"open\" XML issue to be an astonishing replay of the ethernet / token-ring drama, but now, IBM is  the \"good\" guy, and Microsoft looks increasingly like the old, bad, IBM.  It will be a mighty struggle.  But in the end, Microsoft will lose this battle.  Hopefully, Microsoft will come out to be an \"enlightened\" company, as IBM has become. If they don't, they are sealing their own (eventual) doom.\r\n\r\nByron"

    body: "A standard is something that I don't want to have to choose. There isn't much difference in the functionality that ODF and OXML provides - essentially, they both specify an electronic general purpose document format.\r\n\r\nBased on Groklaw's analysis of the two formats, I'd much prefer to implement the ODF standard over the OXML standard. A drawback of OXML is its insistence to have its own standards rather than leverage already existing and capable standards. Another drawback is the ambiguity of some of the specs. Another drawback is the number of specifications that shouldn't really belong as part of a standard.\r\n\r\nThis letter made me laugh because the spirit of the letter (choice of standards) doesn't seem apply to anything other than their own product. When the state of Massachusetts decided to required ODF as their format of choice, Microsoft did a lot of work to keep this state away from ODF because MS decided not to support ODF officially in its own products.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that MS just wants to maintain its monopoly on user subjugation. Rather than working with ODF, MS created a standard that was designed for only itself with the goal of having a 'standard of one'.\r\n"
