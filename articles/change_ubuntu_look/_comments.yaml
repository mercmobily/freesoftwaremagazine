The good thing with Ubuntu (and linux in general) is that it's possible to modify everything you want. Now I know where to find other themes (gnome-look.org). I have done everything ok but Firefix.\r\nCan you tell me if this is the right way to make firefox look like those themes:\r\n sudo apt-get install firefox-themes-ubuntu?\r\nThanks,\r\nLuka Manser\r\n \r\n"
