But not now.\r\n(Beside, why not have a backup copy of everything you need at a nail size usb stick?)\r\n\r\nSorry about my Engrish, I'm not a native English speaker {:P"

    body: "Hi Tony,\r\n\r\nI can see where you are coming from with your article but for me no amount of 'access to my data anywhere' is worth trusting ANY third party with my sensitive information.  The British government has proven time and again that even data stored securely without any connection to the 'cloud' cannot be kept secure.  Adding the layer of third parties to the mix means I do not know who actually has my data.\r\n\r\nOn top of this is the risk of not being able to access the cloud for many reasons.  You may say, as you suggest in your article, that some kind of syncing would happen but would it have synced properly when I have just uploaded 20GB of video and the power goes down just as I hit delete?  I am not sure.\r\n\r\nNo, I do not trust or believe in the 'cloud'.  To me the only data I can rely on is the data on my systems, backups and hard media that I can physically access.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand a 'cloud' based on my hardware with access from my network sounds more usable, power supply permitting(!).\r\n\r\nSimon."
