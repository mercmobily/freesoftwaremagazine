There’s an excellent interview with Matt Asay, Director of the Open Source Business Conference and Director of Novell’s Linux Business Office and Open Source Review Board. 

You can find out more about the [conference](http://www.osbc.com/live/13/), and there’s a good overview by [Maria Winslow](http://winslow.linuxworld.com/osbc.htm), friend and fellow blogger.
