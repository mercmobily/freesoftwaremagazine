    body: "1. You are the product of your tens of thousands of genes, the other genetic material that affects their expression, your past and present environment, and the choices you make and have made. Even if you were right about the ownership of a gene, that would not constitute ownership of you. An author can copyright his book as the expression of his ideas, but owns neither the individual words in the book, nor the ideas themselves.\r\n2. As someone else wrote, if a gene already exists in nature there is no innovation its replication, and innovation is a condition for granting a patent. What might be new is discovering a new use for a gene, etc.\r\n3. A patent is a special kind of ownership. It allows its holder to exclude others from the commercialization of the patented item. Someone patenting a novel use of a gene that happened to be part of your genome would not limit your body from expressing that gene in any way it would otherwise express it."

    body: "That [edit: the argument that the patents apply to applications rather than the genes themselves] sounds like evasion to me. Patents have been awarded for \"all applications resulting from\" gene sequences, when the company doesn't even know what they have. That's the same as claiming the gene itself as property. You can dress it up with double-speak, but the meaning is the same.\r\n\r\nLikewise, cell-lines (e.g. of cancer cells) become the property of research institution, completely ignoring the fact that they came from human beings. These are cases of treating discoveries as if they were inventions, and they furthermore ignore what might be thought of as the natural right of a person to own their own genome (just as you (should) own your own body).\r\n\r\nThis seems to me like an important principle of freedom.\r\n"

If Einstein2 was just as capable of coming up with General Relativity, he should be allowed to commercialize it when s/he does (including keeping things zero cost).\r\n\r\nPatents are an extension of the mentality of \"to the victor go (all) the spoils.\" Or the mentality of First means everything, second and the rest mean the same: nothing. It is this extremism that makes it possible for a few to be ridiculously wealthy instead of simply better off.\r\n\r\nI am waiting for this and other anti-society body of laws to be made a little more equitable, but this won't happen until there is greater competition by the majority of the population for top notch jobs, that is, for when the masses provide enough competition for the elite positions in society (or when they become clued in to what is going on).\r\n\r\n"
