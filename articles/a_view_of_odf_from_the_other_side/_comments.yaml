    body: "As a long-time user of OOo2 (I started testing it when it was around build 59, and I used it intensively with builds 10x), I've followed the ODF vx MSOOXML fiasco for quite a while.\r\n\r\nWhat it summed up to:\r\n\r\nOriginally, MSOOXML wasn't supposed to be open: you could read the XML specs but it contained a binary key for presentation, you were forbidden from creating an applicatin that could read/write it as-is without getting a licence, and it was supposed to be better due to the existing XML file format in Office 2003 (that could only be used in complete client-server environments, and which are, in fact, completely different formats!). You could read the XML code witha text editor, but that was pretty much it.\r\n\r\nThen the State of Massachussetts decreted that their documents should be encoded in formats that allowed 100% access (both content and format) now and in the coming centuries, and ASCII doesn't cut it anymore. MS binary formats were being phased out, and the State found that the upcoming MSOOXML was open in name alone:\r\n<ul><li>you needed to pay Microsoft for a licenced software to edit it,</li>\r\n<li>you needed to pay Microsoft a licence fee to write a document reader,</li>\r\n<li>Microsoft was the only entity allowed to review and modify (or NOT) the file formats.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nMeaning that if Microsoft scrapped the format all your documents may become binay noise, if they revoke your licence you can't access your documents anymore, and if they disappear you lose support on the software used to edit these documents.\r\n\r\nYes, Microsoft may disappear - in 10, 25, 150 years. The State will probably last longer.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, OpenOffice 2 provided the first ever complete implementation of the OASIS OpenDocument format. Strangely, Microsoft was a member of OASIS, was supposed to help shape the new format, and later complained that said format couldn't cover all past functionalities provided by its previous office suites (which may just be bull$hit, since OOo can import 99.95% of older Office documents, sometimes better than MSO itself).\r\n\r\nThis started a big trouble: since MSOOXML didn't qualify (although Redmond marketers tried to make State officials believe that what was written was of no importance), it left ODF - which was proposed as an ISO standard on the fast track (and eventually approved, as pointed out in the article) - as an editable document format, and PDF as an open presentation format (PDF language is, indeed, free - but editors are hard to write). Massachussetts officials wouldn't budge from their position, no matter how much FUD was sent their way (they had competent technicians digging through the marketspeech).\r\n\r\nSo Microsoft changed its MSOOXML licence at least twice - it is now pretty much as open as ODF (it may even get implemented in OOo, since it SHOULD be compatible with the GPL in its most recent incarnation), but refused to implement ODF natively (a 3rd-party pluging is about to come out, though), and tries to have it recognised as an ISO standard too - but ISO doesn't like redundant standards, so that left only ECMA.\r\n\r\n---\r\nA computer is like air conditioning: it becomes useless when you open windows."

This is mentioned at http://www.consortiuminfo.org/standardsblog/article.php?story=20060506173536926 (there are also a number of interesting opinions related to ODF on that site). The main page at the OpenDocument Foundation also refers to their plug-in and their plans to make it available to the public after development and testing is complete.
