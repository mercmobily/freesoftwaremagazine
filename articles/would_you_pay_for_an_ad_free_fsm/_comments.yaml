You can't simultaneously serve the profit motive and be a charity cause. That's one reason why it matters that you \"get something\" in exchange for your subscription -- it establishes a healthier, non-obligatory relationship.\r\n\r\nOne major major reason to have a \"pay for no ads\" service is that it shuts up the nay-sayers who object to the ads. \"If they don't like 'em, they can pay to remove 'em.\" Then they're out of your hair (or at least, nobody listens to them).\r\n"

Or to put it another way, MS are paying a chunk of their advertising costs. So you can say goodbye to them too.\r\n\r\nThat leaves people selling server space, server hardware and a handful of component suppliers that might sell bits and pieces to us nerds that build our own PCs.\r\n\r\nObviously it's cheaper to run than TUX because you're not paying writers (I was one for a while and miss the income) but you still need to pay the bills. I think subscription is the way forward for ALL media, I'd consider paying for satellite TV if it came without adverts, but it's an uphill struggle persuading people that have come to expect things 'free' and to accept that advertising is everywhere.\r\n\r\n--\r\nRegards\r\nPhil Thane"
