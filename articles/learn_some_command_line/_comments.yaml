For instance,\r\n\r\n<CODE>find . -name \\*~ -print | xargs rm -v\r\n</CODE>\r\n\r\nwill tell which files it's deleting. Just an extra bit of reassurance that you've done the right thing. :)\r\n\r\nLawrence D'Oliveiro"

So, pipe STDIN through \"tee\" before passing it on to \"xargs\", like this:\r\n\r\nfind . -name \\*\\.c | tee c.list | xargs grep -l sprintf\r\n\r\nThis would list all the files with the (slightly dangerous) \"sprintf\" function, while making a copy of all the files checked.\r\n\r\n"
