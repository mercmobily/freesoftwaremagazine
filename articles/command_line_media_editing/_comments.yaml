    body: "I downloaded Sox from sourceforge, configured and made it, but it doesn't seem to include soxmix.  \r\nIs there a special configuration flag that needs to be set in order to enable soxmix?\r\nI'm trying to find a command-line tool that can mix two MP3s, and soxmix seems to be a perfect fit."
