10. **Nohup - Run a Command Even Once your Shell is Closed** --Oftentimes you’ll be in a situation where you want to run a command on a remote machine that will take a long time to complete, but you want to be able to issue the command and then log off and have that command run in the background. There are many ways you could achieve this, perhaps by using cron or at to schedule the command to run right away. However, there is a better way.

**GNU/Linux free software tools to preserve your online privacy, anonymity and security** --By Gary Richmond. Whether you are online or offline, freedom matters. Like good health you never think about it or miss it until it is under threat or actually gone. If you love freedom, you probably love free software and it has given us some terrific tools with which to defend freedom. In this article I will give an overview of some of the available resources (Freenet, Wikileaks and Tor) to protect dissident opinion, facilitate whistle blowing and promote the safe and anonymous development of free software.

Recently a blog post entitled “Why Desktop Linux is its own worst enemy has come across my feed-radar a few times.

**Creating web pages, the right way** --By Mitch Meyran. Have you ever felt that warm fuzzy feeling of knowing that your code is error-free and complies with the latest standards? In terms of programming skill, web authors are too-often seen as the bottom of the barrel (you will notice I didn’t call them ‘web programmers’) due to the apparent forgiveness and limitations of the platform. However, they are required to cover a large array of programming expertise and, even worse, they must ensure that their code runs the same on various platforms–something “real” programmers consider a challenge.
