    subject: 'What we can do to help Asus put more Linux PCs on the market'

    body: "Gary,\r\n\r\nThank you for brining the light into this subject. Its quite unfortunate to see that someone is getting \"a free ride on [Linux] tail, mate\" if we use Gordon Gecko's vocabulary and not admitting the part of EeePC success to FOSS phenomenon. \r\n\r\nOf course, it's quite natural and expected to see the corporate clout to prevail in situations such as these. It comes as no surprise to someone who follows closely or knows MS tactics. \r\n\r\nI believe what we can do in these situations is to help organizations, such as public libraries, schools, nonprofits and small businesses to order computers with Linux option pre-installed and help change the demand for Asus. Asus is put in a very tough spot, it is also a corporation and belongs to the group tightly controlled by Intel and MS. Going against this powerful couple can lead to big financial losses and unnecessary legal trouble for the computer manufacturer. Shareholders will not like it despite all the effort and drive that the management and engineers put in the FOSS support. However, shareholders can not say \"no\" to something that market demands and that is where IT professionals and IT decision makers can help. Help to generate demand for Linux Asus PCs. \r\n\r\nWe also should support companies and buy their products, like Zonbu, who openly advertises the fact that they use Linux and other open source software, such as OpenOffice.org. Make it difficult and costly for PC makers to ignore the Linux. \r\n\r\nThe corporate business may be tough, but Asus still should give some credit to Linux and put a more serious effort on disclosing this on their websites and in their campaigns. Nothing wrong with giving consumers a choice and providing an objective comparison feature matrix as many car makers do on their websites. \r\n\r\nFinally, enthusiasts and organizations (such as Linux Foundation)that support FOSS, should also help promote FOSS-based products. Put online a few consumer information websites and educate the end-users. I know it may be too much for many consumers out there, but little by little the word of mouth will take its tall and the seed will turn into a larger tree of FOSS consumers.\r\n\r\nAlex\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    body: "I agree with the tone of the article because we have seen how even the once revered OLPC turned their back on GNU-Linux when Microsoft came calling with their 7 year old PREVIOUS OS.\r\nIt was a legitimate worry.\r\n\r\nBut the Splashtop technology Asus will be using is hard to push aside like which OS will come pre-loaded.\r\n\r\nEvery Asus motherboard and a few laptop series will come with Splashtop's instant on technology. That's millions of motherboards every month that will come with embedded Linux.\r\n\r\nThere is a good chunk of the Windows using public that will live in the Linux section (for those that dont know: the progs are Firefox, Skype, Pidgin (for IM) and a photo viewer) and almost never go into the main OS.\r\nTHAT is going to be huge.\r\n\r\nIts unfortunate that the tech media barely acknowledged this even though we geeks have been whining for two decades about slow boot times.\r\n\r\nAs my friend Mike said: \"Splashtop isnt the promised land (Charlize Theron) but its damn close to it (Ali Larter)\".\r\n\r\nAsus is a bit of a mystery to me... I dont understand why they would price themselves in the 600$ range for their 9inch versions of the EEE.\r\nBut on the other hand, their small EEEBox at 269$ which looks like a Wii will fit in nicely in the living room. (the EEEBox will come with Splashtop)\r\n"

    body: "Great comment. I too wonder about the lack of GNU+Linux as a front page option for these computers. How ever I think that these OEMs should be given some credit as well. Both the original post author and the commenter state that. \r\n\r\nWhat is more is that I would expect the commercial distributions to be doing some adversing them selves. The blame does not all belong to the OEMs. Zero dollars are as of now spent by the distributions on advertising to the Microsoft or Apple crowd."
