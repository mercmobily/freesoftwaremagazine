    body: "So far, it seems like the Blender projects are independent films, but I should like to point out an idea that I've been thinking of for some time: a free-content <em>series</em> could be quite reasonably developed, using the same basic principles (and would probably be more financially successful).\r\n\r\nPeople buy \"more in the same series\" all the time, without necessarily having seen the result. They learn to trust that they will like \"Season 2\" if they liked \"Season 1\".\r\n\r\nSo it would be quite feasible for a small production company to work on a pre-sales basis. You start by producing one episode (or a mini-season, or some other teaser). This uses investment capital.\r\n\r\nYou then set a funding target for the next episode, and pre-sell copies of it. When you hit your target, you start production on episode two.\r\n\r\nOr you set timed deadlines, and a minimum amount raised to avoid cancelling the series (this might work better if you were managing multiple series at once).\r\n\r\nOf course, your earlier episodes will be \"hyperdistributed\" -- copied over and over again due to their free license. But this will serve as constant advertising for your later works. Fans will want to catch the work when it first comes out, and will be willing to pay for the privilege (not to mention because they want to support the project).\r\n\r\nI think this kind of \"series\" model would work better than just producing one-off stories. The same basic model has already been used for various kinds of web-published serial media (e.g. web comics), and of course, the Blender movies are similar, so I think there is precedent for it to work.\r\n\r\nThe biggest obstacles are probably figuring out what the target funding should be and actually managing the escrow process (though there are some web services that specialize in the latter). If you develop enough trust in your fan base, though, the escrow may become a minor matter.\r\n\r\nI'm nowhere talent or trained enough to try this yet, but it's something I'd like to try sometime.\r\n\r\n"
