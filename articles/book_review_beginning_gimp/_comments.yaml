    body: "Books like this will introduce the everyday person to the world of FOSS and show them the type of software and freedom that can come from FOSS.  GIMP's can seem daunting because it is different and not the way people are used to seeing things but I hope that this book will that just because it's different, doesn't mean it's bad.  I'm going to pick up a copy for my Mother so that she can see you don't need to buy Photoshop to get a useful photo editing suite.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://claimid.com/shawn\">Shawn Grimes</a>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.shawnsbits.com\">Shawn's Blog</a>\r\n"

    body: 'I''ve used Photoshop for lots of basic stuff, photo editing, montages, etc. I''ve had a desire to learn The Gimp but haven''t really gotten around to it. I''ve attempted a few things, but find the User Interface quite different, obviously, from Photoshop. This book should be a good guide for a newbie folk such as myself. I also agree that you don''t need Photoshop for a phot editing suite, The Gimp should suffice nicely.'

It's just different.\r\nBooks like this fill the gaps in user knowledge, enabling them to use the software as a tool, and not be dominated by the software & hype."

    body: "We can get many of the photo editing or expressing software in these days. Even for my profession I have been using Photoshop CS5 which has outstanding featured. Photoshop has including many of lasted advance features, which is rarely have included on others. Now about the GIMP, I have also using this especially for home use, like creating effective or attractive photo stuff for posting on networking site such facebook, Mig33 etc. GIMP has also unique features, it easy to use, light functions, some I have also use it for my profession even, not much as a Photoshop. I am not saying it's too bad for use because we should know that everything is important on own self. I want to describe this free software as good to use for fun stuff and photo editing and with unique features. \r\n\r\n"
