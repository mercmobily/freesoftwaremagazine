Welcome to another of Free Software Magazine’s fortnightly newsletters, keeping you up to date with us, and all things free software... enjoy!


# General announcements

Once again this week we have implemented two new features to the site to further enhance your experience—live discussion, and tagging!

Our live discussion feature allows you the subscriber, when logged in, to view all articles that have comments that are new to **you**. This will allow you to keep up to date with all of the discussions happening on the site, so you won’t have to miss a thing! You use this feature by clicking on the “Live discussion” link in the left-hand navigation menu when you are logged in. The code was written for us by Earl Dunovant at [Code by P6](http://code.prometheus6.org/). The code has also been returned to the community: it’s all released under the GPL.

We have also implemented tagging, and are currently undergoing the arduous process of tagging all of our old articles. All of the article tags should be complete by the time the next newsletter is released.

Speaking of articles, this fortnight, our bloggers really got into the spirit of things and we have plenty of new and interesting posts to keep you all interested!

# Poll results—Do you help friends and family with their GNU/Linux problems?

The results on this week’s poll were Often (41%), followed by both Never and Constantly (both 20%) closely followed by Sometimes at (18%). These results could say many different things. The fact that you all often help could mean that you are nice people, or could mean Linux has some issues. A lot of you said in your comments that if you can get your family and friends to use Linux, then you are the helpdesk... but a lot of you have friends and families who still have the Windows bug. Read more [here](http://www.freesoftwaremagazine.com/node/1834) and stay tuned for...


# This fortnight’s poll

[Now that the ink has dried, how long do you think Microsoft will wait to start suing free software developers and companies?](http://www.freesoftwaremagazine.com/node/1869)

The Novell/Microsoft deal was big news... everybody’s talking about it and everyone has a different opinion, but the opinions around here range from cautiously optimistic to very forboding. Microsoft has a demonstrated history for asking the little guy to play then pushing him around and walking off with his toys grinning. How long do you think it’ll be before Microsoft starts playing rough?


# Reminders

**Comments**

Your comments on articles, issues, and blog entries are very welcome. They provide other readers with insightful suggestions, further information, and the feeling that they are not alone. They also provide our authors with the feeling that they are being heard. Please comment wherever possible and **don’t forget to log in** so that you’ll be in the running to win the [latest book competition](http://www.freesoftwaremagazine.com/blog/1).

**Avatars**

Avatars are a great way of expressing your personal identity, whether it be a photo or an image that you feel represents the you you want to be. Read more about avatars [here](http://www.freesoftwaremagazine.com/node/1713). To add an avatar: log in, go to “my account” in the menu on the left, go to the “edit” tab and scroll down to where it says “Upload picture”. Now, hit the browse button, find the image on your computer that you want to upload and go to the bottom of the page and hit the submit button. That’s it; you now have an avatar image.
