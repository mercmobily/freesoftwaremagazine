    body: "I think the main problem with the \"free software\" label as far as businesspeople are concerned is that it sounds way too much like \"free lunch\". People with a sound education in economics know that nothing is really \"free\": you're going to pay one way or another for whatever you get.\r\n\r\nWithout understanding how free software comes to be, they have no basis for understanding why it can present a much better value proposition to them than proprietary software does. Ideological exposition does absolutely nothing to clear them of these suspicions (indeed it just destroys our credibility).\r\n\r\nWhat _does_ help is understanding of the process. And that's where the label \"open source\" is a winner. It gets across the key factual aspect of free software in a way they can understand: the source is available to alter. It's much easier for someone with a business background to see that the source being open (which _must_ include the right to modify it) is a benefit that can produce software in a way that makes free distribution viable than it is for them to backtrack from the ideology of free software to an understanding of how it can come to be that way.\r\n"
