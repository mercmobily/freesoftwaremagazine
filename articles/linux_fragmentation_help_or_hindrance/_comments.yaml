    body: "I'll respond the the very general question of \"Does fragmentation help or hurt?\"\r\n\r\nMy personal opinion is that fragmentation does in fact hurt GNU/Linux. But this is less an issue of the various overlapping applications or utilities, but the fragmented reasoning behind things.\r\n\r\nI'm a GNU/Linux user for the sole purpose of Freedom. The fact that GNU/Linux is more secure, more stable and less popular are wonderful side effects, but they mean little in why I began (and continue) to use it.\r\n\r\nSo when I see people \"sell\" GNU/Linux to Windows users on the basis of the security, or the speed, and totally neglect the aspects of Freedom, a small part of me dies. What's even worse is when hardened GNU/Linux users don't care about Freedom.\r\n\r\nThat said, the fact that people don't value the same things endangers why <em>I</em> use GNU/Linux. There are, however, people out there who want Linux adopted mainstream at all costs; they'd likely say that the split views helps Linux.\r\n\r\nWho's right? When that question has an answer, this article will have a conclusion."

    body: "I think the idea that installing software on GNU/Linux is overstated. The real issue is that *nixers have access to much more software, and at much earlier stages of development, than the folks using proprietary systems. Any of the top ten or twenty distros will provide near child-proof access to mature mainstream applications. If you can get root user status, that's about the hardest part of installing OpenOffice, Firefox, Gnumeric, Emacs, xpdf, Amarok, Gimp, Inkscape, Abiword etc. \r\n\r\nYou don't run into problems until you start looking at less polished programs, stuff that either serves a niche too small or technical to merit deb-ification, or else it isn't far enough along in development to be released to non-technical users. This is software that *should* be hard to install. If it were easy, then you'd get a lot of unhappy users without the skills to understand what went wrong or contribute bugs back to the developers. By the time the software is ready, they won't want anything to do with it.\r\n\r\nThe real difference between installing software in the *nix world and the MS world is not that it's hard for us and easy for them. The real difference is that the common stuff is easy in both worlds, but while cutting-edge software can be difficult to install in GNU/Linux, it is impossible to install in Windows, because it is simply not available.\r\n\r\nTy"

    body: "Having a choice is one of the foundation pillars of Capitalism. Saying the Linux market is \"fragmented\", with too many distros to choose from, is like saying the car market is \"fragmented\", with too many models to choose from.\r\n\r\nThe closed-source software market consolidated down to a small handful of suppliers simply because economies of scale--closed-source software being very expensive to develop, but very cheap to distribute--leads to a winner-takes-all situation where everybody apart from the number-one player eventually goes out of business. There are no such constraints in open source, because by spreading the development cost by being able to freely copy other people's work, it actually becomes feasible to customize your product for very small market niches.\r\n\r\nThus, the situation today, with over 350 active Linux distros, is never going to \"consolidate\". For every one which goes defunct, two others will spring up in its place.\r\n\r\nWelcome to the land of choice.\r\n\r\nLawrence D'Oliveiro"

    body: "tl;dr\r\nthe user should hire a free software professional\r\n\r\nlonger version\r\n\r\nChoosing what software to use and learning how to use the software is just like participating in any other complex activity, it requires an investment if something needs to be done.\r\n\r\nThe analogy I'll be using is law. Nobody is born with the ability to understand all that is required to handle legal procedures. If a layperson is faced with a legal issue she has a number of choices to deal with it. She can choose to ignore it and get nothing done, she can invest her time and effort into studying the related field, she can get legal advice and/or support from people that aren't relevant to the field (not a good idea), or she can invest her time and money and get legal counsel from a relevant professional.\r\n\r\nThe same is true with software (free or non-free). The user can choose to do nothing (and get nothing), can choose to invest some time and effort to study what is available, can choose to study software design/computer science to design and code the required app, can get advice and/or support from a friend or can hire the services of an industry professional.\r\n\r\nIt doesn't matter what the user chooses to do to obtain what is desired, a price needs to be paid if something is to be done. The price is often costly and requires various amounts of investments in time, effort and money. \r\n\r\nThe problem is, people often blind to the long term advantages of the freedoms they inherit with free software and to the user subjugating nature of non-free software. The overwhelming majority of people I know would rather invest into the convenience of non-Free software over investing to the overall superior investment of Free software.\r\n\r\nBasically, if the user doesn't know which free software to use, she should get some advice from a knowledgeable friend or pay for a free software professional. If the user doesn't know how to operate a free program well enough, she should get some advice from a knowledgeable friend or hire free software professional. If the user finds her Free program is inadequate, she should she should enlist help from a knowledgeable friend or hire a free software professional."

    body: "Your points are incisive, and I can agree with the basic concepts. The problem (for me and many users), is that we often don't know what we're getting into with this whole Linux thing. I am and have been an MS user for several years now. While I hate Microsoft and their ilk, I have to give them props for making the system relatively easy to use.\r\n\r\nThe problem isn't just about fragmentation. Most us are people who are either limited in our time, our income, and so we may not have the personal resources available to study each and every single application, let alone all of these distros. From an average user's stand point, it should not be difficult to invest in a new app. I don't need tailor made software, just software that installs without having to track down all of these packages that I don't know about or understand.\r\n\r\nI agree, freedom has its price, and there does need to be some sort of investment. But consider this: I tried several Linux distros. I was only able to figure out how to even get one of them to boot, much less to install later on. Then, I tried to add a few applications to add to my productivity. It was a royal nightmare. After an intial investment of a full week spent in research, tracking down fixes or work arounds for the various problems that I had, I became frustrated, and dumped the entire thing altogether, and went back to Windows.\r\n\r\nIn contrast, it took me less than a day to get going with Windows. In less than three days, I was going full speed, the worst of the so-called learning curve over and done with.\r\n\r\nI agree with the author... things do need to be made a bit easier. I shouldn't have to seek advice or professional help for something that I can already do with ease on a similar system.\r\n\r\nI'm willing to invest, but only up to a certain point."

I have an IQ lower than my shoe size and I can assure you that even I could install it. Maybe I just have the devils' own luck but I have rarely failed with an install and I have installed all the major and some of the smaller distros on an assortment of new and old desktops and two laptops.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I started Linux back when Redhat 9 was just out and that was the first distro I installed. In that time it has come a very long way and installation has become relatively easy with intuitive graphical user interfaces and installs from running live CDs. For ease of installation why not try either Ubuntu (any flavour) or debian-based distros like Mepis. Both have live versions to sample, test hardware and install if you like. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The big mainstream distros like Fedora, Mandriva, Suse etc are very user friendly indeed and should not require geek-level skills. Even Gentoo is now kind to relative newcomers. If I was to recommend a version of Linux that should run on most PC architectures I would say that you should give Ubuntu a try, not only for ease of installation but because, once installed, you would have access to almost 20,000 packages via the repositories! If you don't like using Apt-Get on the command line the user-friendly GUI, Synaptic, will ensure easy install of software with all dependencies taken care of.</p>\r\n\r\n(p>Believe me, once you have it installed and downloaded a few programmes you will not look back. Honestly. I'm sorry that I cannot be more specific as you have not indicated the exact nature of your problems getting Linux to boot/install but I can assure that if I can get it up and running anyone can do it too.</p>\r\n\r\n<b>Gary Richmond</b>\r\n"
