He just founded it.\r\n\r\n    So I think that there's no possibility of claiming a copyright on the printed work. Which is no reason not to publish it. Dover Books has been in business for decades, producing editions of books from the public domain.\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>Comment from: Matt Barton [Member] Ã‚Â· http://mattbarton.net</strong>\r\n\r\n    2005-11-04 @ 16:30\r\n    Yes, Dover is an excellent example. I'm just surprised--shocked, frankly--that a big print publisher hasn't already stepped up to cash in on all the GNU FDL and the CC-licensed materials that allow it. Is it that they just don't trust these licenses?\r\n\r\n    Or does it just not make sense to render Wikipedia in print form, since part of its value comes from its constant editing?"
