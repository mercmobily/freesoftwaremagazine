I especially enjoyed the lack of any competitive tone, something that's hard to find in tech articles these days.\r\n\r\nAnd now, I need to go check out Metisse! :)"

    body: "This is experimental software and not intended for general use. It will be harder to install in the meantime. Much experimental software for Windows or OS/X is just the same. \r\n\r\nMost modern desktop Linux systems have a completely GUI software installation system: you select the software from a list in a program, click 'INSTALL' and type in your password. In many cases you can also just double-click on a package to install it. \r\n\r\nTip: When you see a file ending in .gz or .tar it probably means you have to compile it. "

    body: "PC keyboards oribinally had 88 keys. It was then extended to 101 (the numpad's dual functionalities were separated, and we got arrow keys, etc.), and when Windows 95 came out, Microsoft 'created' an extended keyboard with two 'Windows' keys and a list key (creating the current 104-key keyboard layout).\r\nHowever, Apple already had, with the Macintosh, a similar number of keys with a very similar layout - and two 'Apple' keys.\r\nSince X, Gnome, KDE etc. also run on Macs, it was impractical to refer to those different keys separately (no way you'd get an 'apple' key on the same keyboard as a 'windows' key), and on the other hand, it would have been unfair to call it the 'Windows' or 'Apple' key' (asking Mac users to use the 'Windows' key was akin to asking them to cut their own finger).\r\nThe solution was to give these keys the same name - and the chosen name was 'Super'.\r\nI think Sun hardware (with Solaris) also have an extra function key, and it is used as such too.\r\nIn short, the 'super' key refers to that extra key on your keyboard that represents the major OS for your architecture.\r\n---\r\nA computer is like air conditioning: it becomes useless when you open windows."

We'll see about productivity... but I love the way it looks!\r\n\r\nCompiz is installed and enabled by default in Linux Mint 4.0.  I also found you could install the latest PCLinuxOS and type 'beryl-manager' in a terminal window and it would start Beryl.\r\n\r\nThat's pretty friendly!  You just have to have a supported video card.\r\n\r\nDebian based distros, like Ubuntu and Mint, use Synaptic package manager.\r\nEven without the package manager, if you download a .deb file (or .rpm for RedHat style packages) and double click, it usually runs the default package installer utility.\r\n\r\nThat's pretty friendly!\r\n\r\nBeing free, Linux is not quite as 'polished' as an OS supported by the country's richest man.\r\nBut it's good.  Very good!\r\n\r\nRemember, you didn't learn your current OS in a day.  Give it some time :)"
