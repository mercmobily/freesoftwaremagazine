    body: "\"Freedom cannot be forced on people.\" \r\n- Terry Hancock\r\n\r\nThat is true. Freedom is not imposed on people.\r\n\r\n\"Freedom to choose GNU/Linux means also the freedom to choose Windows as well.\"  \r\n- Terry Hancock\r\n\r\nThat is true as well, but I'm more concerned about people's freedom not to choose windows. That's why it's important to push back against their monopolistic, anti-competitive business practice. \r\n\r\nConsuming Microsoft's market-share is vitally important for the purpose of giving people the freedom not to choose Microsoft Windows, because Microsoft has so much money, they're subsidizing the hardware manufacturers to block users from access to choices other than Microsoft.\r\n\r\n\"We can argue that it’s a bad deal, but we don’t have the right to force people to choose one over the other. Nor should we pass value judgements on them for their choice: we don’t know the basis of their decisions, nor can we claim superior knowledge of their business.\"  \r\n- Terry Hancock\r\n\r\nIf I were a business owner, I would not permit my employees to use Microsoft products. If I were the owner of a business, I would have the right to choose what operating system my employees used on my internal network, and Microsoft products would be an unwelcome and insecure intrusion into the privacy, security and integrity of my network. So in that circumstance, I could require people to choose free software over Microsoft. \r\n\r\nIf I were in charge of choosing the curriculum of a computer literacy class or a computer science course in college, I would also feel entitled to require that the software they learn should be available to students with full respect for their user freedoms and available at no cost.\r\n\r\nIf I were in charge of setting standards for public infrastructure, I would be comfortable requiring that voting machines must not be proprietary software, and that other public infrastructure not be entrusted to proprietary (and implicitly inferior) software.\r\n\r\n\"In brief, we don’t need power over them! Seeking it is actually counter-productive to our goal of creating a more free software ecosystem.\" \r\n- Terry Hancock\r\n\r\nI agree, we don't need power over them, but we need to curtail their power over us. Seeking to effectively resist oppression is not counter-productive to keeping a free software ecosystem. It's okay for tactics to be reactionary in some cases, but the strategy needs to be proactive.

You are in a sense, correct, but I personally chaff at that kind of treatment.\r\n\r\n> If I were in charge of choosing the curriculum of a computer literacy class or a computer science course in college\r\n\r\nYou assert similar power for school administrators.\r\n\r\n> If I were in charge of setting standards for public infrastructure\r\n\r\nAgain, you assert that such organizations should have that kind of power over you.\r\n\r\nYou then assert that your proposed _decisions_ are right (as if these \"ends\" justified the above \"means\"):\r\n\r\n> I would also feel entitled to require that the software they learn should be available to students with full respect for their user freedoms and available at no cost\r\n\r\n> I would be comfortable requiring that voting machines must not be proprietary software, and that other public infrastructure not be entrusted to proprietary (and implicitly inferior) software\r\n\r\nWell, maybe -- those are fairly good ideas. But there are people who believe just as strongly in the opposite decisions, and can make their own arguments for why various proprietary softwares should be used. As a no-brainer example: many school curriculum planners would insist that it is much better for students to learn the particular software programs they are most likely to use in the business world, which right now, means Microsoft software.\r\n\r\nWould you want _them_ to have that level of power over _you_?\r\n\r\nPower is a two-way street. Freedom is the centerline of that street. Don't reach across it, unless you want people reaching back.\r\n\r\nIn each of these cases, the take-home point is _not_ that those people should have the power to make those decisions and enforce them on other people, but rather precisely the opposite: that because they _do_ have power over other people, their decisions should be open to public scrutiny and democratic decision making.\r\n\r\nThe teacher should _listen_ to his students' opinions on what software they should learn. The choice of voting software should be subject to approval by the electorate, and (one could argue) the source code should be available for public review. And so on.\r\n\r\nThe good news (from your PoV), is that you should have the right to agitate for those decision-makers to make decisions in favor of free software. The bad news is, the proprietary lobbyists have the same right.\r\n"

Suppose one person had just made the case for abolition of slavery and someone who were a bigot and an ignoramus (not at all like you) responded by saying something like this: \"there are people who believe just as strongly in the opposite\"?\r\n\r\nThe answer is that those people who believe just as strongly in the opposite are wrong. \r\n\r\nOne of the popular criticisms of liberals made by \"conservatives\" is the lack of moral conviction or moral clarity. The \"conservatives\" call it \"moral relativism\" or \"moral ambiguity\". \r\n\r\nIn this case, hypothetically placing yourself in the shoes of your ethically deranged opposition creates confusion rather than clarification.\r\n\r\nI remember as a child when commercial television and vending machines found their way into my public school. At the same time, school lunches were reduced in quality and availability. \r\n\r\nThere is a long tradition of academic freedom which is being ravaged by private interests. Now, where is the federal funding for public schools? Where is the federal funding for college education?\r\n\r\nAll of the public infrastructure of the United States is under attack across the board. It is the work of people like Grover Norquist who wants to \"drown the government in a bathtub\". \r\n\r\nI'm really not inclined to consider your hypothetical question about the proprietary software being imposed on me in the same manner I would demand free software.\r\n\r\nIn the private sector, companies can and do require applicants to use proprietary software. They have that right to do so. \r\n\r\nIn school they also require students to learn proprietary software quite often. In school, they should not be permitted to impose proprietary software on students. \r\n\r\nIn the infrastructure of our voting system, they should not be permitted to use proprietary software.\r\n\r\nFor voting infrastructure, public school children's curriculum, I have zero tolerance for proprietary software. I'm not willing to entertain the idea that the opposition has a leg to stand on in this debate. \r\n\r\nThey can take their proprietary software and shove it! "

Suppose one person had just made the case for abolition of slavery and someone who were a bigot and an ignoramus (not at all like you) responded by saying something like this: \"there are people who believe just as strongly in the opposite\"?\r\n\r\nFrom [Answers.com](http://www.answers.com/bigot&r=67)\r\n=CODE_START=\r\nbig·ot (bĭg'ət)\r\nn.\r\n\r\nOne who is strongly partial to one's own group,\r\nreligion, race, or politics and is intolerant of\r\nthose who differ.\r\n=CODE_END=\r\n\r\nBigotry is not limited to one side of any fence. Those who opposed slavery did not suggest the imprisonment of the slave owners without giving them the opportunity to change and neither should we.\r\n\r\nStatements like the following one could easily be perceived by those you oppose as bigoted. I am not saying you are a bigot I am saying that in this context the label could be applied by both sides and that makes its use in an analogy worthless.\r\n\r\n> The answer is that those people who believe just as strongly in the opposite are wrong. \r\n\r\nThey may be but if you believe \"Freedom is not imposed on people\" then surely you have to allow them the opportunity to be wrong. Now some of us may believe strongly that--because of certain practices by proprietary companies--certain parts of society are not being given a fair opportunity to express their freedom of choice but if you are saying the answer to this is to impose free software on them then you are going a step too far in my eyes.\r\n\r\nIn your previous comment you list a lot of \"if I were\" statements, all of which suggest that you are not or have not been in those positions and so have the luxury of being able to make statements such as the ones you made. In reality to impose anything on a group of people will generally bring about resentment towards it (unless they agree with it). That resentment can  breed dissent, which can ultimately breed revolution. It's something the music \"industry\" are having to learn with regards the removal of fair use by DRM. If you impose any key decision (such as what software to use) without either explaining to, consulting with and winning the approval of those you are imposing upon, you may well end up doing more harm than good to [y]our cause.\r\n\r\nTerry is correct, if you want people to _choose_ free software, imposing it upon them is not the way to win their hearts and minds. Educate them, coax them if you want to but if you remove all other options you will likely alienate them. This is a lesson the proprietary software world is having to re-learn and it is one the free software community would be foolish to ignore."

Proprietary software should not be accepted in public school for the same reason there should not be Coke and Pepsi machines in public schools. \r\n\r\nThe school consists of a captive audience of children who get preyed upon by mega-corporations like Microsoft and Coca-Cola. \r\n\r\nThe citizens of the U.S. are deprived of our freedom to vote as Americans by a proprietary voting machine company such as Diebold which has used proprietary software to steal elections for George Bush. \r\n\r\nI don't have a say when some government contract is awarded to Diebold. I'm part of a captive market with proprietary software imposed upon me.\r\n\r\nThis is an issue of moral clarity in the case of our voting infrastructure. There are no valid arguments to be made for using proprietary software in our voting infrastructure. \r\n\r\nI take your point about the literal meaning of the word \"bigot\", but I was using it with the connotation the word has acquired from its use in discussion of ethnic issues. \r\n\r\nThere is always someone who might say one thing or another, but that is not necessarily a good reason for one to doubt oneself. \r\n\r\nA coherent mind does re-asses deeply held understandings every time a critic disagrees. That would be too reactive and disruptive to the integrity of a coherent mind.\r\n\r\nI understand Terry's point about our internal sharing being more essential than our outward evangelism.

That resentment can breed dissent, which can ultimately breed revolution.\" -- to which I think you are referring here, I was not talking about legislatively imposing software choices upon business owners. I was referring to the practicality of business owners or their IT managers imposing such decisions upon their staff. Yes I know it is done all the time with proprietary software but IME that brings about the same resentment and dissent and eventual dislike of the software being imposed. If you are a business owner, you are of course within your \"rights\" to make such a decisions without consulting anybody. But I happen to believe business leaders have a responsibility towards their staff as well and dictats rarely go down well. Sometimes though, yes, the business owner has to make the tough choice but choosing free software is always about more than the bottom line and if you want your staff to \"get it\" then imposition of free software is not a good place to start.\r\n\r\nWith regards software choices in voting structures, personally I believe that technology and an anonymous but secure voting system don't mix very well. I am a luddite on this matter and would rather not have electronic voting machines at all. I am yet to be convinced that an electronic system can register that I have voted and keep  the way I voted anonymous. But if we _have_ to have them then yes an open process requires systems that are not proprietary.\r\n\r\nI did understand the way you were using bigot but I don't think you can use it wth that meaning in this context, thus the only other definition we have is the one I gave. To make an analogy between proprietary software and human slavery might add gravitas to our argument but it also cheapens the true horror of daily life for those in real slavery. Proprietary software companies might lock users into contracts and attempt to keep their custom by foul means or fair but should the customer wish to stop using that company's products, they can.\r\n\r\nAs for ceding market-share, my views on this are well documented on this site. Indeed they sparked Terry's post. :o)\r\n\r\ncheers  \r\nRyan"

Perhaps it is already happening in places like Iraq.\r\n\r\nThe reason I brought it up is to show that when the conversation is about an issue more obvious moral clarity than software licensing is today, the idea that there are two sides to an argument doesn't really change the obviousness that one side is ethical and the other side isn't for most observers. \r\n\r\nMy point is that you can always find people who disagree with even the most obviously righteous positions on ethical issues. \r\n\r\nThat doesn't mean those who disagree should be held in equal regard and we should be forced to debate them as if they were just as ethical as ourselves.\r\n\r\nThis is one of the major things which went wrong with the media in recent years which has lead to the terrible circumstances we see in Iraq. \r\n\r\nSane people were forced to debate against crazy people because corporate-media pundits presented two sides to every argument, even when one side was obviously deceptive, insincere, and unethical. \r\n\r\nI don't think we should hold the proprietary software advocates up as if they are on equal footing in this debate. \r\n\r\nThe free software community should seek to prevail over proprietary software in the free market by non-regulatory means, and we should seek to have proprietary software pushed out of middle schools, high schools, and essential public infrastructure by government regulations."

I still do believe that but the context is important, I do not believe free software has to or should attempt to compete with proprietary software on fiscal or market share grounds precisely because those grounds are dictated by the proprietary software companies. Free software should compete with proprietary software on its own terms and within its own strengths. Whether we like it or not a product which is not governed by unit cost can never compete in those terms with one that is -- it's pointless."
