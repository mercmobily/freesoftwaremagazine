    body: "They need to fulfill the obligation to existing customers by keeping the existing servers running. The idea seems ot be that commercial servers will continue running as long as people want to subscribe. They fully expect that free servers might also exist. There is no licensing arrangement to prevent it. So if you have a problem with comercial servers put your rysom server (on line) where your mouth is.\r\n\r\nI have no complaint with this arrangement. Licensing this as GPL would not prevent people from making a business out of providing commercial games servers. This is the way GPL is ment to work. The idea is to prevent having a game server company from going under and thus removing any possibility of the customers being able to continue using the product they paid for. In this case the customer can begin providing a server if the continuation of the game is important to them.  This does not mean that we must exclude comercial servers."

It's much more like the proprietary Ryzom -- it's a proprietary game, with a bit of free infrastructure inside it."

I'm not sure if planshift does this, but <a href=\"http://www.shadowoflegend.com/\"><b>Shadow of Legend</a></b> is a free mmorpg that will most likely make money by putting advertisments in the the game.  I think WOW is starting to do this.  Anyways, we'll have to wait until the final release is out to find out just HOW they do it.\r\n\r\nHrrm... seems like the html link isn't working.
