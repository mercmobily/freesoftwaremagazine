Now the majority of you aren''t even gamers just lame fanboys... Who cares who the console is made by, just play it and enjoy... They all have features the others don''t and all have there own exclusive games... Its really pathetic people have to argue over whats better... Its just like rascism... And to all of you who are true gamers I thank you'
