    body: "When i was young, you had to know a few things before you were able to actually do anything with a computer.\r\n\r\nI got my first PC with 10 years, and i had MS-Dos. Yes i know, it was bad, but it was all i had and all i knew and all i could get. So, when i needed to start a program, i had to type some commands first. When i wanted to play games, i had to know about stuff like memory management, sound driver and whatnot. I was the only one to have such a machine.\r\n\r\nToday, everything is Point and Drool. And everyone in my family has jumped on the colorful Windows XP train. \r\n\r\nWhen my Dad-in-Law tells me that 'he gets an error when he tries to start that program there and it didn't work', he tried to open some strange file format by doubleclicking it, but he didn't have the right tool for it. They don't care about the difference between a program and a file, they buy machines without knowing what the specs they're reading mean (hands up, who knows the difference between a Megahertz and a Megabyte?), they don't even READ THE [BEEEEP] ERROR DESCRIPTIONS ANYMORE, and come running to me when their ugly little MS-machines stop working, which was their own fault in 99 out of 100 cases. They don't want explanations, not even a solution, they just want a FIX.\r\n\r\nHow do we solve the problem? Give them Linux and tell them to be happy? Tried that, it was a disaster. \"I can't use that, it looks TOTALLY different!\" is what you hear. When they're polite. If not, it's more like \"What have you done to my computer? Bring back the old one or i'll disown you!!!!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease, won't anyone tell me what to do with them?\r\n"

    body: "It took me a while to realise that Microsoft has an underpaid group of support technicians.  They're called nephews and nieces by many computer users.  My solution has been simple, I refuse to help people not using Free Software.  I help my dad when he has problems with OpenOffice.org (on Windows mind you).  I won't help them with Outlook Express.  My sister wanted a new computer and I said sure.  I can get you one at dealer price but only if you run Linux on it.  She now runs Linux, she emails she draws maps in xfig (xfig - I hadn't even heard of it!), she writes in OpenOffice.org and send Word documents to others.  It has been an empowering experience for her.  She recently went to a computer store to buy a printer, the puffed up sale rep saw an easy target and gave lots of upsells.  Here simple sentence, \"Yes but will it work with Linux\", got him scurrying to his manager to find out.  The tables turned and she was treated like an intelligent customer not an easily befuddled woman.\r\n\r\nSo my solution is simple.  I refuse to be the unpaid support arm for for Microsoft.  Some of my family go elsewhere, that's fine with me.  For me the proof is that I have onverted one or two to Free Software and I don't have to compromise my views on freedom to support the others.\r\n"

For some people it <em>did</em> work, and those people are now Linux users, though they probably abandoned the distro that originally brought them into the fold (or are getting it for free).\r\n\r\nIt's more accurate to say it's not a very robust business model, and that's probably why Red Hat stopped bothering with it. They now focus on their \"enterprise\" edition, and have left the business of satisfying consumers to the free Fedora project, which is spun off of the Red Hat distribution.\r\n\r\nAnd of course, it can be said that while it does attract a few people, the bulk of the market is still too nervous about switching to try the alternatives available to them."

Those that act in a negative way toward new users of FOSS do us all of FOSS community a large disservice.  Most often it is their own fears and inadequacies that get in the way of them interfacing with other people or realizing that they are not the well source of all human knowledge because they used vi err..once...  Most of the Axxholes are actually the newbs anyway but are afraid of being discovered.  People need to grow up and learn that we ALL have everything to learn and should be all about SHARING and COMMUNICATING.  Community based software needs to maintain a positive stance and consistent efforts to bring EVERYONE into the know about FOSS.  Grow up people! Go outside, get a girl/boyfriend and maybe some therapy and maybe you will actually learn something.  And from one FOSS advocate who is not an ass.. Long live FOSS!      '

It took more time to answer his questions on what this would mean for him than to install it and give him the basic training required for him to start using it (two evenings of work, including the recovery of his data). He's now a very happy Linux user. Never bugged me again for help, but each time we see each other he thanks me again for having him helped out.\r\nLinux is a hobby for me. Windows is not. I'm glad to help people with Linux. Helping them with Windows just is boring and annoying. And I tell them that!"

    body: "I've found out that the best way to stop being asked to support others is to refer them to the \"manufacturer\"--usually meaning MS. Hey, they made it, they should know, right? Then they watch their wallet get empty and ask about using \"that linux thing you're using\". They look (and feel horror) at the price of MS-Word, I tell them to look at OpenOffice.org; Photoshop (usually to correct red-eyes in pictures), I suggest they look at GIMP for Windows. The best way to get converts is not so much to go around telling people, \"You're free now, run GNU/Linux!\"; it's best to let them know, little by little, that there's something else, under better terms than they got from MS. (I think Asimov said it (in one of his Foundation novels) that with suffcient grumbling, the leader will fall; no, I can't remember which novel.)\r\n\r\nAs for the forums...that's another matter. Quite frankly if I went into the control room of a nuclear power plant and asked, \"excuse me, what are atoms?\" I'd expect a pretty strong reaction from the personnel (and security). Getting flamed is the price to pay for going into the wrong newsgroup (done it once; that's when I learned I should read the forum/newsgroup FAQ). May not be the nicest or best learning experience, but it was effective in my case. It's not as if typing \"linux help\" into the Google search box on Firefox doesn't bring up linuxhelp.net, linuxquestions.org and several \"beginner\" answer sites. \r\n"
