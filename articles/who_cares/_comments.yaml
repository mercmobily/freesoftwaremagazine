Also, GReader and BlogLines both report no feeds.) ... very interesting. I'm developing a \"discourse-based portal\" that I intend for getting NGOs' talking points out in a way that makes salient information more discoverable ... \"<a href=\"http://bentrem.sycks.net/gnodal\">Participatory Deliberation</a>\" is the buzz phrase I've been using. )Speaking of which, are you aware of <a href=\"http://www.unece.org/env/pp/\">The Aarhus Convention on Access to Information, Public Participation in Decision-making and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters</a>? I'm anticipating something which responds to that imperative but w/o being constrained to things environmental.)\r\n\r\nregards\r\n\r\np.s. I found your post here very interesting. I'm trying to find a FreeSoftware licence that will enable some sort of remunation to finance an \"OpenSource\" information base.\r\n\r\n-- \r\nWhen you look to see how the system works\r\nLikely you will find that it does not."
