    body: "I don't mean to suggest that people don't get behind assuring that this doesn't come into effect but ...\r\n\r\nIn Canada you have the right to create back-ups of music you buy and I assume software, too. Also, file sharing is sort of legal in Canada. At least, it is one way. You're allowed to download but not allowed to post copyrighted material. In both cases, if you were to be inspected and found to carry \"unauthorized\" copies, you could allows claim they are legit back-ups.\r\n\r\nGiven the above, I don't see how the above is enforceable (in Canada), unless some major changes to Canadian law were to occur."

    body: "Well, international treaties are always negotiated and signed by the governments of the states concerned. Then they need to be ratified and signed into binding national law.\r\n\r\nI guess Canadian law doesn't explicitly state that it's legal to download copyrighted content, it just doesn't state either that it is in fact illegal. So you wouldn't have to change Canadian law, just expand it. \r\n\r\nBesides, the USA implemented the DMCA and the EU the 'EU Copyright Directive'. So it doesn't seem that difficult to get those things through parliament (with a little lobbying by Big Media)."
