    body: "As Tony said, we all watch and use Flash and H.264 every once in a while, simply because the web is too much dependent on this single format.\r\nI, too, have flashplugin-nonfree installed on my Debian system, and every time I run virtual Richard M. Stallman (vrms) I am reminded of my sins :) .\r\nBut I always keep the plugin disabled in Iceweasel and the other browsers I use, and I only enable Flash support when I *really* want to watch a video that is only available on Flash+H.264 . Sometimes that means that I rather not watch some content, but some other times I really can't say no, and with a couple of clicks I can watch it like everyone else.\r\nWhy bother? Well, because I'm sure most sites keep track of browser support of their customers, and somewhere on their server there is a little counter that ticks every time someone who hasn't got Flash enabled visits a page. This way I try to support a more open web by statistics, by having that counter tick multiple times a day on my daily web surfing. "
