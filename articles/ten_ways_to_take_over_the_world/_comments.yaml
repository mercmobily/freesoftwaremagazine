It's come a long way since then.\r\n\r\nAs I write this, I'm on a 64 bit (AMD) Linux box at work. We only use Linux with the exception of a few people who must use a few apps that aren't available for Linux. They use dual boot or VmWare to get around the problems.\r\n\r\nAt home I have Windows and Linux (dual boot) on my Desktop and Laptop. I much prefer Linux. It's faster than Windows. All the apps I need from day to day are avialable for free under Linux. About the only thing I use Windows for is my tax returns. I'm looking forward to the day when even that app will be available for Linux.\r\n\r\nLinux has made operating systems a commodity.

    body: "I used to work in a small firm that was windows-centric, and in fact opposed to open source (they refered to it as \"open-sore\" though entirely out of ignorance and assumptions, none had any experience with it)  When faced with the need for another FTP server, they started plans for getting new hardware, software, and licenses.  I told them to give me a few hours with the secretary's old PC and I'd make them an FTP server and if it didn't fill their needs they could go ahead and buy the proprietary solution.  I installed Slackware and pureftpd in an hour and it ran beautifully, probably still running to this day.\r\n\r\nThis event started a chain of converting most of our production machines to linux and open source.  We saw a large reduction in overhead, sometimes combining the processes from several older machines onto new cheap Intel hardware running linux.  The only negative effect was the inexperienced IT guy, who didn't want to give up all his influence, insisted on running Fedora Core on our production machines because \"it supported dual-processor\", he didn't really understand the difference between kernels, distributions, userspace, what compile meant, etc.  Nothing like having the boot process freeze because he corrupted the X config file on a headless machine.\r\n\r\nAnyway, the point I'm trying to make:  People, especially businesses, will not adopt linux \"just because\".  It needs to provide a solution.  So apply it to a current problem and follow through.  Attributes like being free and efficient will help you sell the idea.  Success speaks for itself.\r\n\r\n"
