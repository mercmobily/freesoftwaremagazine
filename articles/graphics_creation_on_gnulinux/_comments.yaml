Why only in the commercial version? Well, you could say that Pantone is a proprietary colour technology.\r\n\r\nAnyway, just try Xara and you'll be impressed, especially by its speed and rendering quality compared to Inkskape. It also has a far much more appealing user interface then Inkscape. The Inkscape team really needs to put more work in the interface."

    body: "...but you may want to transfer your in-progress image to another platform (say, a Mac) without going through a translation; thus, having the Gimp allows you to move your image from one platform to another without hassle, while it isn't so with Krita (which may very well handle Gimp images, but it isn't its native format - and we're talking precision work here).\r\nMoreover, Krita is still young in its present incarnation. It may surpass the Gimp one day, sooner than later even, but personally I don't feel comfortable using 'young' software for professional work. When it reaches version 2, I'll very much reconsider it.\r\nNow the tied-with-KDE thing: a distribution will almost always decide to freeze the version of KDE it ships, and Koffice gets the freeze too. Now if I want to update Krita, I have to update Koffice, and probably pieces of KDE along with it - which is far from practical, and leads to recompiles and tarball hell.\r\nOn the other hand, I can install an updated Gimp binary on pretty much any system (Linux, BSD, Mac, Win32...) that has a recent gtk+2 toolkit available, without need to touch the rest of the system.\r\n\r\nAs a side note, since I use Gnome, installing Krita results in over 250 Mb of packages to download just to get it to run. I get Konqueror and all the rest of kdebase with it, of that I could care less.\r\n---\r\nA computer is like air conditioning: it becomes useless when you open windows."

I need apps for ad designing and layout designing. In short to replace my Indesign and illustrator. \r\n  For layout scribus seems to be best choice. But don't know about its output capabilties. Does it outputs in cmyk format. How is the quality of the output. Does it mactch with of Quark and Indesign. \r\n  For ad desiging and creative work i think inkscape is best. But it exports to png only which too is rgb. How will i use for print publishing. \r\n  And the most important question i have is : Is any serious print professional using linux. Or i will be the only fool doing so. Is linux cmyk capabilities still not mature enough for cmyk printing.\r\n  What apps should i use if i need to work for Print publishing.\r\n\r\nPlease suggest.

If your use of it is more incidental (one ad design every now and then, or graphically light composing) then I don't think you'd find yourself alone; at least, a lot of Web graphics designers do use Linux.\r\n\r\nCheck out this guy: Ayo of 73lab (www.73lab.com), for successful ad/print/Web design under Linux.\r\n\r\nUnder Linux, I know that earlier versions of Photoshop actually work quite well under Crossover Office. Dunno about more recent versions though.\r\nColor (including CMYK) profiles are supported by Linux and X. I know that personally I managed to use Adobe's ICC profiles under several apps. X can be calibrated for R, G and B channels and is provided with a basic calibration tool (but it is always better to calibrate your screen first).\r\nScribus outputs PostScript format; in short, same as AdobeAcrobat, and it does support CMYK (what it doesn't support is converting RGB to CMYK). Its quality is quoted as being on par with Acrobat's.\r\nInkscape stores colors as RGB, but gives equivalence in CMYK colors. Presumably, version 0.5 should support embedded color profiles (and CMYK too). It outputs SVG, but exports PNG.\r\nPresumably, you're better off creating your artwork under Inkscape, import the SVG under the Gimp - which will then do a vector rendering to bitmap - and calibrate it using the same source and destination profiles, for better consistency.\r\n\r\n---\r\nA computer is like air conditioning: it becomes useless when you open windows."
