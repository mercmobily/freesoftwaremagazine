Hilton's action gives the lie to USA claims to be 'democratic', 'freedom-loving', etc. And the same policies are applied to drugs, seeds, the humane genome, etc., etc. Definitely a reason to avoid Microsoft and other US big business bullies, such as Coca Cola, who use paramilitary hitmen and torturers to intimidate the workers at the Coca Cola plant in Barranquilla and poison the groundwater in Indian villages where their plant upsets the natural balance of the groundwater. Not that ordinary US citizens escape from these injustices, of course.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTerrorism takes many forms, and it seems the US uses all of them.\r\n\r\n<hr/>\r\n\r\n<strong>From</strong>: Gio \r\n<strong>Url</strong>: http://www.digitalright.org\r\n<strong>Date</strong>: 2005-10-27\r\n<strong>Subject:</strong> Well said\r\n\r\n\r\nCongratulation to David to say it so well!\r\n\r\nI completely agree with everything he wrote.\r\n\r\nI knew already of the Peruvian case, as well as I follow all the Free software movement especially in Latin America.\r\n\r\nI mostly like that David, like me, believe the issue is extremely relevant because it goes behond users' desktops. It regards the country ICT capacity and independency. A country at whole needs a lot of software for all its system and once they get tied with a provider it would be extremely costly to switch (especially if they don't use open systems), without saying about privacy.\r\n\r\nI like the comparison with the banana wars and thanks of early US imperialism, transformed now in software and media by the neo liberalism.\r\n\r\nAs well as I like the argument that north software publishers want to get richer and richer exploiting a monopoly that their country defends with lies, tricks and pressures in the international trade agreements.\r\n\r\nTo finish that if these senor preach about free market, David correctly invites them to compete, even if they don't get to choose the rules (this time at least)!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGio\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr/>\r\n\r\n"
