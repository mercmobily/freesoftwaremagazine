    body: "I think the numbers could change much faster than you predict. All we need is one good media hit, from a company replacing consumer windows boxes with Linux boxes. There are so many people fed up with Windows and Vista right now, it could easily be 20% of the market in a year, and doubled two years after. By the time you see 50%, Linux could have 80% of the market. For the reasons you describe, and many others, Microsoft's market share would never recover.\r\n\r\nMigration is always more painful than direct first choice purchase.\r\n\r\nThe question is, where will the consumer get their direct, first choice purchase of a Linux PC?"

    body: "\"However, competitors are nibbling at Windows’ share of the operating system market. In June, Windows had 90.89 percent of the market, compared to 93.06 percent in August 2007, according to Net Applications. Apple’s Mac OS was at 7.94 percent, up from 6.18 percent for the same period, while the Linux OS was at four-fifths of a percent, up from just under a half-percent last August.\"\r\nhttp://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/25850255/page/2/\r\n\r\n\r\nIf we double again, we could grow as much as Apple did! (sarcastic voice)\r\n\r\nLinux is NOT just about the community of developers. Linux IS ALSO about the community of users. Free the MicroSerfs!"
