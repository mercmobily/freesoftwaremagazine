I don't mind paying $30 to have my PC ready to be used as soon as it arrives. But for a business that buys in bulk (+ upgrade to XP Professional) it adds up.\r\n\r\nAnother question: DO you really expect Dell install/support Linux free of charge?"

    body: "While I'm not too bothered about having GNU/Linux preinstalled, I would like it if Dell started selling hardware which specifically works well with free (as in freedom) GNU/Linux systems. However, as they've neglected to mention freedom or the existence of GNU at any point, they may well just supply that hardware support with proprietary drivers. That would mean that Dell's support of \"Linux\" would be unlikely to provide any benefit to anyone who uses GNU/Linux because of the freedom it allows them.\r\n\r\n--\r\nGNU - free as in freedom"

Some of the feedback has been all about freedom.\r\n\r\nDell now says they'll certify their hardware with Novell. They don't say they'll preinstall Novell Linux, but can we be sure they'll install something free when the time comes or will they install, say, Linspire?\r\n\r\nWill their \"Linux\" offering be \"value-added\" with proprietary nVidia drivers, Macromedia Flash and RealPlayer?\r\n\r\nIt'd be great to have Dell PCs sold with preinstalled GNU/Linux, but I think we should continue to comment at the IdeaStorm site so that there are at least <em>some</em> people who call the OS by its proper name. ;-)\r\n"

    body: "To me, the freedom aspect is more important than the cost aspect. If Dell invests money in pre-installing GNU/Linux (hardware certification, support staff, whatever), then it's perfectly okay to pay for that.\r\n\r\n(GNU/Linux might be cheaper because there are no license fees. But then again, there are fewer customers. Anyhow, prize is not the point.)\r\n\r\nWhat bothers me is that I have to pay license fees to Microsoft, who are all but friendly towards free software, just to replace Windows with GNU/Linux the first day the PC arrives. <em>That</em> doesn't make any sense."

    body: "I like my Dells. I like Ubuntu family of distros, I like F/OSSware. I use all three. Had Old Dell PCs- poof they got new life w/Ubuntu, one until processor finally went. Old Dell server at work- poof three more years running RedHat. Best thing to date is my new D620 never even booted fully into MSW - I put on the brakes, dropped in Ubuntu Edgy and poof- I love my new work laptop.\r\n\r\nI wished Dells choice of wireless cards had better Linux support out of the box but gave up awhile ago, got an ASUS PC card and have used it in two PCs so far right out of box. And I wish more games played in Linux land but Crossover Office/Wine helps there a bit as does VirtualBox container running WinXP.\r\n\r\nBut, for the bulk of PC users out there, they want a PC to arrive at the door fully loaded, fully configured so all they do is plug it in and poof- email, internet, document creation, photo munging. Not sure Dell will get Linux distro(s) ones out there but maybe they can help, but not take over.  \r\n\r\nRight now I'm seriously looking at System76 product line for that second home PC I need :) and theres a 'open letter to Mark Shuttleworth' about getting Canonical into the hardware business."
