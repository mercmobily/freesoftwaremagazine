    body: "Thanks for the clear explanation. Unfortunatly, every new drupal version needs revision of almost any hacks. No exception for this one.\r\nTo get the tertiary links in Drupal 6 you would do\r\n$m = menu_navigation_links(variable_get('menu_primary_links_source', 'primary-links'), 2); \r\nbecause menu_primay_links() has lost it's footprint in Drupal 6\r\nhth\r\n"
