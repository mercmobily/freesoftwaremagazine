    body: "There is no doubt that an Open Source WCMS is a very powerful tool for associations and that it will help getting the most of very limited technical ressources. It will also help members being able to publish their own content with a very limited training. In the french speaking word, the WCMS SPIP (http://www.spip.net/fr) has become immensely popular. It keeps a list of registered sites, and, on november 25, the first page of this list contains sites registered bewteen november 13 and novembre 25 (http://www.spip.net/fr_article884.html). It is also a purely open source initiative and its community does not depend on any company. The french publisher Eyrolles has also published several books about it (http://www.eyrolles.com/Informatique/Recherche/index.php?q=SPIP&themes=INF).\r\n\r\n\r\nMarie-NoÃ«lle Baechler\r\nBelmont-sur-lausanne / Suisse\r\n"

    body: "The open source debated is indeed been going on for a while and I doubt it will cease, I have given much thought to using a commercial cms platform for a site I have been working on called http://www.seek4finance.co.uk/Finance-Directory.html but in the end went for a Drupal based system which is open source and hugely customisable..and a very cost efficient Web content management system.\r\n\r\nDamien \r\nTechnical Producer\r\nwww.seek4finance.co.uk"
