    body: "Why do I repeatedly have to read install instructions for a Linux distribution?\r\n\r\nSomebody who installs packages should know how this works. This is a basic action for a handling a Linux. if he does not know yet, he should learn. There is no much sense to learn how to install ONE package. And OTOH - there are so many ways to install, so many distros and setups - sometimes the default way can be wrong. More concrete instruction should only be necessary for special setups or usages.\r\n\r\nI would like to see that authors just tell to install. If absolutely necessary one can also give some hints for compiling. But that is more 'special'.\r\n\r\nSo generally - telling a Linux user to install a package with the name \"gramps\" should ring a bell. No need to elaborate."

I find the interface ok to do genealogy including the many dialogs being used (you get used to it), only the GNOME file chooser is annoying, but you know that from firefox and openoffice...."

I am recently come to GNU\\Linux.  When I first started two years ago, this information was of vital help and it still comes in handy if nothing else to copy and paste.  Please do not be the arrogant person who does not consider that the author may have a broader audience in mind.  If you want converts to the OS make it easy.  Do not belittle people because they do not yet know which \"fine\" manual or how-to to read.  It took some searching for me to find the right information, not because it was not there, but because I did not know where to look.  A blurb or paragraph in the article is easily skipped if unimportant to you.  But if it were not there, it would be hard to find if needed."

    body: "I take your point and generally agree. It becomes a pain to read detailed descriptions of how to install a package. But if you check the top of the article you will se it is rated as \"Easy\" - that is for those who may not be particularly experienced at installing anything other than the base install of their distro (if that). If these beginners are to learn how to install any package they sometimes need to overcome the (mistaken) idea that it is difficult. A brief installation description can often aid that and encourage people to \"give it a go\".\r\n\r\nThe installation description for this piece was an editorial request but one I agree with in this case for the reasons given above. You'll note I pointed beginners to the Synaptic article and gave only the briefest information so as not to bore more experienced readers. The key issue (for Ubuntu users) being to remember to include the universe repository. I didn't include other Distros because I have no experience of them and in the end I was more concerned with explaining what GRAMPS can do.\r\n\r\nIt's always going to be tricky because invariably you'll end up putting too much or too little for different parts of your readership. In the end - for a piece labelled \"Easy\" - you have to include enough info to give beginners a kick-start whilst not so much that experienced users get bored before you've started.\r\n\r\nI hope that's what I did here. :o)\r\n\r\nRyan"
