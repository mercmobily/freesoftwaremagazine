    body: "While I'd be the first to agree that a free software license from the FSF is a lot more trustworthy than one written by Microsoft (understatement!), the analogy with software is a little bit flawed.\r\n\r\nLegal documents do resemble software in their precise and formal use of language, but legal documents are interpreted by Human beings, not by computers.\r\n\r\nThis throws two monkey-wrenches into the \"more complex\"=\"better quality\" argument: \r\n\r\nThe first is the assumption that more words will necessarily improve the fidelity of the interpretation. Regrettably, human beings are not as predictable as computers, and can get confused or apply their own biases to the interpretation of the text -- even in a formal court setting. Writing too much can cause extra confusion or cause a reader to skim over text, missing important parts.\r\n\r\nThe second is that, as the length of the license increases, the burden on licensors, licensees, and legal practitioners to understand and apply the license terms is quickly increased.\r\n\r\nCompute cycles are cheap and even \"interpreters\" don't really interpret the original source files directly, so we don't worry so much about this with programs nowadays. Not with the size of binaries, and certainly not with the size of source code.\r\n\r\nBut Human time is expensive, and that's what a long license text burns up. So brevity, clarity, and ease of understanding have to be goals for a good license.\r\n\r\n(Or if you like, \"Humans are poor interpreters of code\").\r\n\r\nI too approve of the GPL 3.0. It's a big improvement over GPL 2, but it does come at a fairly high cost in understandability and especially brevity.\r\n\r\nI still think that the GPL v2 is a beautiful document, and partly because of its brevity. It stands almost as a \"constitution\" for the Free Software movement -- while the GPL 3.0 reads as a rather mind-numbingly long and detailed piece of legislation.\r\n\r\nWhich we need when it comes to legal battles. But the GPL v2  is still the document I'd give as assigned reading to people who want to understand what Free Software is.\r\n"

    body: "While I appreciate that the GPLv3 resolved some issues that some developers had with GPLv2 (like Tivoization), it simultaneously made itself less desirable to some developers who didn't agree that those things were problems.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice to have a GPLv2.1 that just fixed a few of the ambiguities and problems in GPLv2 to bring it in line with experience, rather than also adding a bunch of new issues. I understand the FSF owns the license and wants to express its philosophy in the license, so it's not surprising that they didn't go that way. However, I wish someone would take on writing such a license (perhaps somewhere in the Linux community, which has a somewhat different philosophy that I find more congenial).\r\n\r\nI also wasn't very impressed with the public comments process. As far as one could tell from the outside, there was no real evidence that the public comments, as opposed to those gathered in the committees, had any impact. In particular, there were a couple of wording issues identified in the brief final review that seemed to be real issues but were unresolved. It would have been much preferable to have SOME kind of feedback to the public commenters, rather than just silently accepting whatever they said (and, for all we knew, dropping them on the floor).\r\n"

    body: "While Spolsky's note about reusing old code has a lot of useful observations, it's important to consider the other side. The code fixes that represent real experience also make it harder to read the code and, more important, harder to guess whether any particular change for new functionality will work right (because of potential interactions with those hard-to-understand bug fixes). I think those issues would apply equally to licenses, where lawyers are absolutely certain to haggle over any inconsistencies between parts of the license.\r\n\r\nThere is some literature on the subject of reusing versus rewriting. While the numbers vary, the put a relatively low threshold (like 10-20%) on the point where it is cheaper overall (over the entire lifecycle of the change) to modify or rewrite.\r\n\r\nActually, though, I'm not sure why Ciaran included the point at all, since GPLv3 is essentially a rewrite, rather than modification, of GPLv2...\r\n"
