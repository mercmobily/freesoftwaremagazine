    body: "\"So it will be in the EU, in 2007. If the big corporations can't get software patents in the front door, they will try to get them in through the back door. And if the back door is also blocked, they will throw it in through a broken window.\"\r\n\r\nThe good thing about the EU is the fact that one country can veto the whole patent thing  with a simple no, no majority needed, it only takes one country.\r\n\r\nI think we wont here a thing about software patents in the EU for a while.\r\n\r\nMy prediction is,  open source use in European cities will increase this year, less influence from Microsoft, and a more \"no software patents allowed\" attitude in the EU and Europe."

    body: "Excellent point. If other countries refuse to acknowledge and enforce software patents, the USA and countries that <em>do</em> acknowledge software patents will be at a disadvantage. As long as we have strong holdouts like China and the EU, we will be safe.\r\n\r\nThanks for the positive viewpoint."
