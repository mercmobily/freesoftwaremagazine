    body: "I read this article some time ago and found it really interesting. Great idea, hope the Narya Project takes off.\r\n\r\nNow, I discovered a site called Innocentive which does a kind of the same thing in scientific research. I'm not sure if they're doing it the right way. They don't mention free/open content, so the results of the collaboration might be unfree once again. If I understood the FAQ correctly, the Solver (scientist) has to transfer all his 'intellectual property rights' to the Seeker (investor) after the deal is made. :-( \r\n\r\nIf you want to have a look at the site anyway:\r\n<a href=\"http://www.innocentive.com/\">www.innocentive.com</a>"
