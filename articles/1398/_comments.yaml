A few small utilities that appear to be under an actually \"open\" license and source code that only extremely large companies or governments can view (but not change or compile) all fall under the same name.\r\n\r\n    I suspect you are right on target when you guess why this is being done. Confusion and misdirection seem to be the goals.\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>Comment from: Defenestrator [Visitor]</strong>\r\n\r\n    10/25/05 @ 11:49\r\n    The second to last paragraph is quite interesting. It would be very interesting to read more details about events that created the need for secrecy, especially the pressure to fire people.\r\n\r\n    Some years ago a colleague was also invited to speak at a national level to government decision makers on the topics of Free and Open Source software, though not in the US. There was great expressed interest from the group, but at the last minute the organizer made a great effort to cancel the talk, finally 'compromising' with a delay of several months. A couple months after the postponement a large contract was signed with MS and the talk cancelled altogether.\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>Comment from: David Sugar [Member] Ã‚Â· http://www.gnutelephony.org</strong>\r\n\r\n    10/25/05 @ 12:39\r\n    Def, I did not elaborate further simply because that was not the original focus of this article, although perhaps I should in a future one. At the time, curiously, I was also a last minute substitute speaker, for the original free software advocate who was going to give that presentation was snowbound in Connecticut. So I ended up giving a presentation of a working Open Office system on a GNU/Linux desktop using one of my own work computers to people who had been told adamently through their various and regular contacts with Microsoft federal sales people that either no such thing exists or that it simply does not work :)."
