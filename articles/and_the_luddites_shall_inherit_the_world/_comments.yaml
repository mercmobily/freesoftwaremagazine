The value of a comment should be judged by the comment itself and not by the identity of the poster. I do not want my life archived for anybody to collect with a little hard work. I don't want my online actions to be traced at all.\r\n\r\nI abhor digital restrictions mismanagement and treacherous computing because of the implications they involve. I don't bother buying watching tv or buying DVDs; instead I rent the stuff I want to watch from video stores.\r\n\r\nPeople just don't know about the implications of doing all these things that they do. I let them be as well as advocate to not participate in these things activities."
