# Poll Results—How do you feel about the idea of governments mandating the use of free software in their countries?

This topic stimulated quite a lot of discussion and debate about freedom, and government, and power, and software... In the end the most popular opinion in this poll was “I think governments should be only be able to mandate use of free software in their own departments”, which received 45% of the vote. This was quite closely followed by “I support any government mandating the use of free software” with 33% of the vote, and then “I don’t think governments should be allowed to dictate software use in their nation in any way” with 18% of the vote. And 4% had a different opinion. Read more [here](http://www.freesoftwaremagazine.com/polls/governments_mandating_free_software) and stay tuned for...


# This fortnight’s poll

Let us know how you contribute to the free software movement. If you contribute in multiple ways just let us know the primary way or choose “other” and comment.


# Reminders

**Comments**

Your comments on articles, issues, and blog entries are very welcome. They provide other readers with insightful suggestions, further information, and the feeling that they are not alone. They also provide our authors with the feeling that they are being heard. Please comment wherever possible and **don’t forget to log in** so that you’ll be in the running to win the [latest book competition](http://www.freesoftwaremagazine.com/blog/1).

**Avatars**

Avatars are a great way of expressing your personal identity, whether it be a photo or an image that you feel represents the you you want to be. Read more about avatars [here](http://www.freesoftwaremagazine.com/node/1713). To add an avatar: log in, go to “my account” in the menu on the left, go to the “edit” tab and scroll down to where it says “Upload picture”. Now, hit the browse button, find the image on your computer that you want to upload and go to the bottom of the page and hit the submit button. That’s it; you now have an avatar image.
