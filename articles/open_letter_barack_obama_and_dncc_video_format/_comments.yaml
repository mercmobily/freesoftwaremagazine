    body: "It really is that simple. By using its content patents and IIS server licensing, Microsoft seeks to obtain the monopoly it was denied in its earlier anticompetitive tactics (253 F.3d 34 U.S. v. MICROSOFT CORP) @ http://www.precydent.com, the open law source.\r\n\r\nMSNBC (one of my favorite channels) is especially bad about this. And over and over on websites, IIS checks your browser and kicks you out if you run open source (even if your browser is fully capable of displaying the content). This code is even in the samples MS hands out, so it is also creating a fraud (saying your browser can't display the content while it can display more content than IE can) to perpetuate their browser monopoly - in violation of the above court decision.\r\n\r\nAll you need is a lawyer, a class action suit, and a real (non-republican appointee) judge.\r\n\r\nAs is the rule with Open Source, don't just kvetch - DO SOMETHING about it!"

    body: "This is strictly for the video from the Democratic National Convention Committee. Senator Obama's site also uses Flash (which isn't optimal, but certainly more palatable than OS X / MS-Windows-only applications).\r\n\r\nThe upsetting thing is the contradiction between Senator Obama's promises for an open government, and the actions he tacitly condones by allowing disenfranchisement.\r\n\r\nThis isn't so much about Senator Obama vs. Senator McCain. This is about words vs. actions. This is about the promise of freedom vs. the restriction of freedom."

    body: "Obama has completely ignored mentioning saving tax payer's money through the use of open source software or anything about patents and how stifling they are.  In fact, he really hasn't attacked big business much at all, instead it seems like it's mostly been ways to spend money to research alternatives, when IMO perhaps some of that is fine but the real problem to address is making sure the market is a level playing field, that competition is occurring, that monopolies are broken up if need be and aren't getting away with unfair business practices *ahem*forcing Windows on all new computers*ahem*, and perhaps he could throw in a few tax incentives.\r\n\r\nRegardless, I don't think anyone has really done the research as to how much money is wasted on proprietary software in the U.S. every year which has suitable free alternatives for.  I find it very offensive when this happens.  France and several other countries have various rules about examining all alternatives like open source software before making decisions about implementation, not to mention the rules about using open standards for free access to information by citizens.  The U.S., as well as all countries, need to make sure policies like these get implemented."
