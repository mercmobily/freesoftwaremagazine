    body: "<strong>Comment from: Petr Bren [Visitor] Ã‚Â· http://bhy.xf.cz/</strong>\r\n\r\n    02/28/06 @ 12:00\r\n    Thanks for the review. I'm also planning to install GNU/Linux on an older computer, the hardware is similar to what you describe. However, I am not sure whether or not I will choose DSL. Don't they include some non-free programs? They claim that there is more on the livecd than just stuff from the Debian respositories. Also, I don't see them listed on that GNU's page with links to completely free distros. Is it a truly free operating system? Thank you.\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>Comment from: David Sugar [Member] Ã‚Â· http://www.gnutelephony.org</strong>\r\n\r\n    02/28/06 @ 13:01\r\n    That is an interesting question. I think most changes are simply related to making specific packages use less disk space. Some core libraries may be built with different options, and some packages with less features, than found in a standard Debian build,for example. The library changes if they exist, in particular, could lead to some incompatibilities, I would imagine.\r\n\r\n    They also have a front end control panel application (I think written in tcl) that is not part of Debian, but I am not aware of it being non-free in any way. They also do different startup/init scripts as they have some things they import from Knoppix, particularly for hardware auto-detection. I believe DSL also does include support for the NDIS wrapper stuff for wireless cards, but I do not believe they include such drivers in the distribution. My wireless card happens to be one supported natively by Linux kernels.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>Comment from: Robert Allen [Visitor] Ã‚Â· http://allentech.net</strong>\r\n\r\n    03/01/06 @ 01:15\r\n    I still run - and use - 4 Pentium 120 MHZ notebooks (Sharp 9020 model) with Linux. I have tried several distros but settled on Mandrake 7.2 with my own kernel build and Fluxbox as the window manager.\r\n\r\n    Originally they came with W95, later upgraded to W98 (with poor performance) and installed Suse 6.2 as the first Linux distro. They gave several years good service as my main personal systems with Mandrake 7.2. They are now primarily used for development - C/C++ and Perl, as terminals and data logging stations for various applications, and as GREAT teaching tools for my kids! Without Linux they would have become scrap long ago...\r\n\r\n    (Largely BECAUSE of my experience with these systems, and with Windows thru 2000 Pro, we went 100% Linux in 2003 - and never looked back!)\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>Comment from: John Kloosterman [Visitor]</strong>\r\n\r\n    03/01/06 @ 09:19\r\n    Well - one of the advanches of small modern distro's like DSL is that everything is up to date (securety-wise). The problem with W95/W98 is the fact that they are not loger supported or mantained by de software vendor.\r\n\r\n    This means that, beside the fact that Linux is more safe than W95/W98, DSL is actively mantained - while the older versions of Windows are not..\r\n\r\n    I run DSL on a Compaq LTE5300 (P130) with 32Mb memory and 2Gb HD. As this laptop does not has a CD-Rom player, I had to use ftp setup (using the TOMSRTBT mini-linux on floppy), but within as little a one hour I've got everything installed and running. Everything works really nice (tough I would not advice to use the included Firefox because the memory consumption of this browser makes it very slow).\r\n\r\n    All in all I'm impressed...\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>Comment from: David Sugar [Member] Ã‚Â· http://www.gnutelephony.org</strong>\r\n\r\n    03/01/06 @ 11:59\r\n    This means that, beside the fact that Linux is more safe than W95/W98, DSL is actively mantained - while the older versions of Windows are not..\r\n\r\n    And this was why I wanted to put a current distro on the machine. Certainly, there were older distros that still would work on it, like the Mandrake 7.2 I originally had used, and there is nothing wrong with older distros, except that they are often no longer activily maintained.\r\n\r\n    Maintaining DSL forward is a bit tricky once you do a full harddisk install, however. If you do the special compressed (frugal) hd to partition install, then it is easy to wipe out the 50m root image, since all the personal settings are kept in a separate partition.\r\n\r\n    But if you do the full hd install,you cannot entirely maintain it through apt, since there are parts which are not Debian. That is the one use case where I think it needs further thought, and the right answer, I suspect, would be for them to have a forked repository so that their specific changes and stuff can also be maintained through apt. A hd \"update\" script, along with the existing hd \"install\" one, could also have been a useful addition to the live cd. Or maybe I missed something where they have an option to update after full hd install."
