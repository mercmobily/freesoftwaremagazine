We are currently looking for authors. If you want to have your say about a free software specific topic, or if you’d like to share some of your technical knowledge with the rest of the free software community, please contact us.

You can find FSM’s authors’ guidelines [here](http://www.freesoftwaremagazine.com/write_for_us).

Your writing will gain fantastic exposure. Your article will be professionally edited, and will be released under a free license of your choice (while you keep the copyright!).

Our authors also get to write book reviews and newsletters.

Write for Free Software Magazine—have your say!
