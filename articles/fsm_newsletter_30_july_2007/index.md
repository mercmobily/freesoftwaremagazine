# Poll Results—How do you feel about the GPLv3?

Last fortnight we decided to poll you about the immensely controvertial GPL version 3 license. While there has been a lot of press hoo-haa about the license, a massive 72% of you have no qualms about calling GPL version 3 a fantastic, much needed license. This was followed by a modest 13% of you believing that the license is good, but has some problems. 11% of you didn't have an opinion. Finally 2% of you decided that the GPL version 3 makes no difference, and another 2% of you think it's a bad thing. Read more [here](http://www.freesoftwaremagazine.com/polls/how_do_you_feel_about_the_gplv3) and stay tuned for...


# This fortnight's poll

[The FSF has (among other things) designed the GPLv3 to prevent tivoization. What do you think about this?](http://www.freesoftwaremagazine.com/polls/gplv3_preventing_tivoization)

When designing the GPLv3 the FSF intentionally included measures to prevent Tivoization. Some people think that TIVO-like companies shouldn't be allowed to create hardware that only runs specific software, because doing so renders modified software useless. Other people feel that TIVO-like companies should be able to do so, that hardware and software are two different things, and that the GPL is stepping out of the software boundaries. What do you think about this? Good, bad, in between or neither?


# Reminders

**Comments**

Your comments on articles, issues, and blog entries are very welcome. They provide other readers with insightful suggestions, further information, and the feeling that they are not alone. They also provide our authors with the feeling that they are being heard. So please comment wherever possible.

**Avatars**

Avatars are a great way of expressing your personal identity, whether it be a photo or an image that you feel represents the you you want to be. Read more about avatars [here](http://www.freesoftwaremagazine.com/node/1713). To add an avatar: log in, go to “my account” in the menu on the left, go to the “edit” tab and scroll down to where it says “Upload picture”. Now, hit the browse button, find the image on your computer that you want to upload and go to the bottom of the page and hit the submit button. That's it; you now have an avatar image.
