    body: "As Dave Neary said about OpenWengo project:\r\n\r\n\"The torch has been passed. Finally, in late January, the news was announced. The project has a new maintainer, Vadim Lebedev of MBDSys. Vadim has been involved in the project from the beginning - he was hired by Wengo to write the back-end code for the first prototype. His company has experience providing customisation services on top of the software. Heâ€™s absolutely the best person for the job.\"\r\n\r\nhave fun\r\nhttp://blogs.gnome.org/bolsh/2008/02/05/openwengo-not-in-limbo/\r\n"
