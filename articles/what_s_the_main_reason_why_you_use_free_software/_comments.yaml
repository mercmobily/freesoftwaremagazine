    body: "Definitely \"freedom\". I <em>develop</em> free software because I want to support the community, and I want to support the community, because I respect its fundamental commitment to freedom.\r\n\r\nI do think that cost has to be figured in as well, though.\r\n\r\nThere are no real examples of \"non zero cost but free\" software. When you do pay money \"for software\", you are really paying for media and/or services -- ancillary products, as it were -- not software. Software can't really be \"non-zero cost but free\" because cost <em>is</em> a restriction on your freedom.\r\n\r\nThe closest thing to \"non zero cost but free\" is when you actually sponsor the writing of the software, but then you're really contracting a programmer to do a service for you (writing the program), not buying the program.\r\n\r\nAs an individual, it's usually a much better deal for me to learn how to use the software without paying for support services. Most of the time it's more fun, too. However, if I were to need the software in a mission-critical application in a commercial environment, I'd be deciding between paying an employee to learn the software or \"outsourcing\" the work to the commercial software provider. It's easy to see in that situation why it's generally a better deal to hire the people who already know the software rather than to pay for someone to learn the software on my nickel. ;-)\r\n\r\n"

    body: "I use free software for a variety of reasons.  Of course, it being free in cost is a benefit, but that is not the major reason why I use it.  I think that FOSS is in most cases of a better quality than proprietary software.  It is also a lot easier to participate in  the development of it via feedback.  The worry about losing a registration key no longer exists, and there is less chance of good software disappearing as someone will usually take over development if the original author is no longer able to.\r\n\r\nI've also found that support is a lot better via places like forums than you get with non-free software.\r\n\r\nI really just love being a participant in something that is not controlled by mega-corporations such as Micro$oft."

The next year I discovered OpenOffice and I've slowly been converting over to free  bit by bit ever since. I just spent my first grad school Christmas break converting to an Ubuntu/XP dual boot on my own. I like being able to use programs to do things without having to worry about if a personal project turning into a profit project will violate a EULA I couldn't understand with a BA in English.\r\n\r\nAnd, best of all, I can often find what I need online without needing a credit card number.\r\n\r\nLuckily I haven't had to ask for support yet, but having the forum archives and a user-generated wiki available when I was trying to set up wireless? Priceless, particularly since others had already tried to set up the exact device I was working with."
