    body: 'This argument doesn''t include any analysis -- it merely states conclusions.  For example: "Software patent: it applies to mobile resources: new ways of doing things, or methods. It has unclear boundaries (methods are difficult to define absolutely, and they overlap in horribly complex ways). It uses exclusive ownership for resources (new ideas) that produce much more value when shared. It is poorly bounded (it depends on a set of negotiable definitions such as “technical effect”), and it is very expensive."  Questions: How do you derive your statement that new ideas would produce more value when shared?  You don''t back that up.  How are "new ways of doing things" mobile resources?  How are they more like a "migrating bird" than a "lobster?"  At its core, the idea of a patent is that the creator of the idea owns it.  I think the only problem with software patents is that the USPTO is not yet able to differentiate the "new ideas" from those that already exist.  Once that''s cleared up, and it only makes sense that it will be, I believe that exclusive ownership of ideas will provide more innovation for the economy.

I used my \"invention\" of swing set anchors that I rigged up to keep my daughter's swing set from tipping over.  What I discovered was that I had to create a scaled drawing detailing my invention.  This accomplished two things: 1) it established the scope of my invention, even for a lay-person, and 2) it made it possible to compare my invention with other similar inventions in a straight-forward way.  (FYI, the company wanted much more money up front than I was willing to pay, but the experience was very interesting.)\r\n\r\nAfter having performed a brief search for any patents that might affect my application.  I became physically ill from the stress of seeing the number and scope of the patents that could be interpretted by a non-developer to describe my application and had to stop.  I felt like I was playing MineSweeper with only a couple dozen empty spaces in a 32x32 field.\r\n\r\nThe problem with software patents is that the detailed design is difficult to understand, even for a developer, and probably completely unintelligible for a lay-person.  This makes it virtually impossible to determine the scope of the alleged invention.  And in turn, comparing a patent to an actual program is a case of he-said/she-said.  No judge or jury will ever be able to judge the technical merits of the case.\r\n\r\nTherefore, what this has created is a special privileged class--software patent holders--who have an advantage even beyond other patent holders.  They can claim that just about any program in the very broad category of their patent is in violation.  I would think that there is some legal precedent disallowing the creation of this special class, but IANAL.\r\n\r\nAt the very least, I think the US PTO should require that a prototype of the invention be included with the patent application with instructions on how to run it.  If this could be mandated by the courts, then the number of applications would undoubtedly drop, as well as the percentage of approved patents.\r\n"

    body: "Having recently applied for a software patent I have given this a lot of thought as I am an avid Slashdot reader.  Meaning I am keenly aware of the large misuse of software patents and the growing movement against them.  I am also aware that there have been many patents granted for software that should not have been.\r\n\r\nA part of the problem in the larger debate that is not often addressed is that many patents have been granted that seem to provide the patent holder with a monopoly on achieving some goal, whereas we traditionally think of a patent as providing a monopoly on some *particular means* for achieving that goal.\r\n\r\nConsider the every day goal of providing light for a room.  There are many known ways to do so: incandescent bulbs, fluorescence, LEDs, candles, fiber optics, etc.  Each of these provides some unique means for solving the basic problem of providing light.  Any patents that may have been granted to the inventors of each of these technologies seem (to my eyes) to be perfectly reasonable.  However if the USPTO were to grant a patent for providing light (with no specific implementation) we would have a serious problem.\r\n\r\nIt seems though that many software companies have gotten away with patenting light, so to speak.  The patent office seems to have some trouble distinguishing between the tangible (wires, capacitors, circuits) and intangible (software) aspects of computing and so have granted patents for what (to them) seems to be a specific implementation.  For example, Slashdot ran a piece a while back on patent granted for online testing (http://yro.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=03/02/04/0513214).  Nevermind about the (non)obviousness of this patent, in this case the PTO has granted a patent for the *goal* of providing a plurality of tests online, with little information regarding the specific implementation.  For example, are the tests generated dynamically or are they stored as static files.  Is the test presented in HTML or some other form (XML, RTF, binary, proprietary).  How are the results calculated?  How is the testing information transferred (HTTP, FTP, SFTP, proprietary), and how are the results returned?\r\n\r\nThe only particularly unique ascpect of this form of test taking is that the tests are computerized a coupled to the internet as summarized in the patent: \"the first computer including software means for generating the test and software means for posting the test on the Internet; and a second computer operatively coupled to the Internet, the second computer operative to allow a user to take the test and receive test results.\"  For the patent examiner unfamiliar with the intracacies of software the patent is perfectly valid.  All he knows is that the test is being sent down a wire (there's even a diagram of this in the original application) and that particular (tangible) aspect makes it unique from other methods of taking tests.  He does not automatically recognize the distinction between a custom, encrypted, stand alone, proprietary test taking application and a no brained HTML form.  The distinctions here are basically intangible.  To the examiner one window with test taking buttons on the screen is the same as another.\r\n\r\nI would argue that the particular \"nuts and bolts\" of a software application consist of very specific algorithms (e.g. marching cubes algorithm which is used to trace 3d boundaries) and a very specific collections of user interface elements and behaviours (e.g. the \"Start\" button, and all that lies therein).  Very specific algorithms such as marching cubes generally require a great deal of research to devise and do not make for goal oriented patents.  If for example, I devised an algorithm that achieved the same goal as marching cubes, only using Fourier transformations (as opposed to the adjacent cell checking of marching cubes), then I would be perfectly justified in patenting my algorithm and licensing it to Lucas Arts.  Likewise if I could develop a set of interface elements that provide convenient access to my computer files and applications (but did so in some manner distinct from the \"Start\" button) then I could again file for patent and license the invention to Microsoft.  The goals (tracing 3d shapes, providing access to applications) however, are not nor should they be patentable.  The lamentable fact is that patents for *goals* such as these have been and are being granted.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    body: "Hintjens' criteria for what is good property are interesting and sensible, but philosophically they are no less arbitrary than any other.\r\n\r\nThe concept of property is intuitive to the human mind. I think it is fair to say that it originally applied only to things that you can carry with you. The concept is useful to humans because we are a social tool-using species.\r\n\r\nMany civilizations have made use of the intuitive understanding of property, extending it to things that you cannot carry, such as land. This seems to come rather easy. The possibility of owning land makes sense once you get used to it. However, it is not obvious to all societies. Native americans had difficulty grasping the concept when the Europeans arrived. To them, ownership of land probably made as much sense as the taboos and magic superstition of foreign societies do to us.\r\n\r\nA peculiar thing about our civilization is that we have extended ownership to encompass abstracts, things that only exist in our minds. Someone can be the owner of e.g. a story or a judicial proceeding. You have to admit that this is rather strange. It is a large step closer to magic than owning land. On the other hand, it may be a key factor for well-functioning economic and judicial system. Ownership is the key concept of capitalism, and this magic is part of the foundation of our civilization.\r\n\r\nOf course, this says nothing about whether software patents are good or bad. Hope you enjoyed it anyway.\r\n"

Namely, with software, it is very easy to create a different way to achieve the goal.  For example, if I replace an algorithm with one that just adds some redundant steps (read a dataset from XML instead of relations, for example) is that now a new \"invention\"?  With physical items, making a new type of propellor takes more research, effort, etc, but with software it would be very easy to get around patents like this.  This makes the existing patent system much weaker for software.\r\n\r\nThis is probably what justifies the PTO and courts making software patents more general, but that's probably a poor workaround to a fundamentally flawed system wrt software.\r\n\r\nThanks again for giving what seems like a strong foundation to start the argument with."

A copyright protects the particular arrangement of words in a book, for example, just as a copyright over a particular arrangement of source code in a program might be appropriate. But to claim patent over a particular software solution is an inappropriate use of a particular tool. Patenting an invention, a design for a physical device or a clearly specified solution to a particular engineering problem based on a physical object is slightly different but still needs to be rigorously investigated any time an infringement is alleged. Even in the realm of such inventions, patenting is not always a flawless means of protecting the creator/designer/inventor. In software engineering this flawed nature is magnified.'

Society grants me a patent for publishing this new knowledge/product because it would otherwise not gain the benefits were I to keep the knowledge secret.\r\n\r\nHowever if the manner of doing something is obvious and can be easily done by others, such as writing a variety of programs to say achieve the outcomes of an online shopping trolley, then what is the advantage to society of giving exclusive rights, and thereby increasing the costs in return for no benefit to society, to the first person that comes long with the idea?\r\n\r\nThere is no societal advantage in this latter case and society should not lend its weight by granting patents when anyone in society can by their own endeavours achieve the same outcome ..... this is why software patents are a nonsense. ... and why people should be rewarded with a patent for truly non-obvious and truly non-replicable ideas where society at large would otherwise be incapable of doing the same for itself.\r\n\r\n"

    body: "Q: How does one conclude ideas generate more value when shared?\r\nA: An idea that is not used cannot produce value.  Useful ideas are valuable to anyone using them, and the fact someone else is using an idea does not diminish its value to you except in the sense of competitive advantage.  Example:  I know how to add numbers.  Everyone who knows how to do this task derives a benefit from it.  The fact you know how to add numbers in no way deprives me of those benefits.  However, if I am in competition with you, it would benefit me to deprive you of that ability so that I might have significant advantages over you.  In the case of ideas, you can hurt someone else by prohibiting use, but you are not directly damaged or prevented from using it when the idea is shared.  Thus, the more people with access to the idea, the more benefit a society can obtain and the more value is rendered.\r\n\r\nQ: How are 'new ways of doing things' mobile resources?  \r\nA: A mobile resource is one that travels outside controllable regions.  A fish pen is a controllable region.  An ocean is not.  Ideas 'travel' by finding utility in unpredicted areas.  The same software that might identify faulty widgets by shape might also be applicable in uncounted other areas, sorting mail, picking Lotto numbers, etc.  Code re-use is of enormous benefit to a programmer.  Making it illegal hampers their productivity by orders of magnitude.\r\n\r\nNote: The USPTO is _NOT_ charged with protecting 'new' ideas.  It is only charged with protecting the first non-obvious creation brought to their attention.  'Obviousness' of an invention is so ill-defined that patent challenges normally require a minimum of $50,000 merely to consider fighting it.  'First' is similarly problematic.  So much so that a major feature many patent reformers want is removal of the inconvenient 'first to create' criteria and replacing it with a far simpler to prove 'first to file' option instead.  The stated purpose of patents is to encourage the creation of new inventions by insuring the first creator will gain a profit from it.  Software is incredibly cheap to make, but a lawsuit over it is expensive out of all proportion to the original benefits.  There existed no dearth of new software inventions before patents applied, but now that they do programmers and researchers explicitly AVOID many areas just so they won't have to worry about it.  There is provably less innovation and useful product produced as a result."

If there was little or no benefit in discovery/invention the rate of discovery/invention would drop. If there was a big or huge benefit it would rise. This 'benefit' is normally the economical gain through exclusive rights, monopolies, but I can easily see rewards that are more fit to maximize the beneficial effect for sociaty as whole. First thing to understand here is the fact that monopolies and economically models have a use for restricting the distribution of said invention/discovery, and that such a restriction can slow or weaken the benefit for society. Rewarding patentholders, not with the exclusive right to control the innovation and/or discovery, but with the right to gain an amount of money according the how beneficial the said discovery/innovation is.

Open standards do not have to waste time enforcing protection rights, open standards enhance and are enhanced by sharing models which make bad economic sense.\r\n\r\nSo, for me, we should not allow software patents precisely because doing so  makes absolutely bad economic sense and great socialogical sense. Perhaps if we stopped software development from being such a \"business\" oriented field we would find those left behind after the mass exodus would be those actually doing it for the sake of making things better.

Now we have a housing market onto which out of control, private rented accomodation is extortianate and first time buyers cannot afford anything without first borrowing five times their combined salaries. In the past these people might have rented from their council whilst saving a deposit but - thanks to the right to buy policy - there are virtually no council properties left! The local councils have lost huge amounts of revenue that would have come from their rented accomdation and as a result local services have suffered.\r\n\r\nNo I think I would say that it is far from clear that private home ownership is a \"healthier\" model.

And it cost you nothing (except the time it took to produce the code).\r\n\r\nNow, an objection to my argument might be this:\r\nconsider a generic, abstract algorithm (say, the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm for finding a maximum flow in a connected graph). An implementation of this algorithm in <a href=\"http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/\">Ruby</a> would have given its creator a copyright for <em>that code</em>. Another person implementing the same algorithm in <a href=\"http://www.python.org/\">Python</a> would not infringe on the Ruby copyright (perhaps depending on how it was implemented; the languages are quite similar).\r\n\r\nAny (patent) system that aims to attribute exclusive ownership over pure mathematical ideas (or, simply, discovered truths) must somehow include a way to define scope. That's what the hypothetical objection above is all about afterall. The inventor might have come up with the algorithm when solving a particular problem coding in Ruby. On the other hand, he or she might have studied the problem of finding a maximum flow in a connected graph in the pure mathematical, abstract sense and simply implemented <em>a</em> solution in Ruby.\r\n\r\nAn exclusive rights system would want to grant the forementioned inventor exclusive rights over her \"invention\". It is my opinion that, granting the inventor exlusive ownership of the algorithm in the second sense (preceding paragraph), is equivalent to granting her ownership of the <em>goal</em>, which we don't want to do. Granting her ownership in the first sense (i.e. right to the algorithm to solve a particular problem) is readily handled by copyright.\r\n\r\nThe objection might still hold though, but, considering the alterative, it is the best solution for all involved; the inventor can write software solving particular problems (or very general problems for that matter) and make money on it; she can publish the source code (but doesn't have to) and still make money on it, because she holds the copyright; she can publish articles describing the generic algorithms used by her software and still make money on the software; others can read what has been published (if anything) and try to write better software, forcing the inventor to improve her software.\r\n\r\nHence, there is no need for an exlusive rights system that differs from what copyright has to offer today."

Before you jump on me, let me explain.  I realise that the \"dismal science\" may have a bad reputation, but I'm not speaking about politics here, simply the mechanics of wealth creation through trade.  When we trade things, be they ideas or products, we can both benefit.\r\n\r\nAnd on this basis, some property systems create common wealth, while others reduce it.\r\n\r\nFree software is based on rules for exchanging ideas and work that are more efficient than previous rules.  That's why I say it succeeds because of economics.\r\n\r\nYou may prefer government-owned houses, but I lived in Britain during the 70's and early 80's, and I remember very clearly the time when councils started selling houses.  It turned grey estates less grey, and made a lot of people a little wealthier. I doubt these rents were very important to councils, they were always pretty low.  Council income crashed (iirc) because of changes in the distribution and control of money from Westminster (more direct spending).\r\n\r\nThe reason for basing the argument on economics is to provide a non-ideological argument against software patents.

So you have exclusivity for the patent for its terms, and then, in theory, everyone else and his mother can begin producing the invention.\r\n\r\nWith copyright, that's hasn't really been an issue until software because artwork, books, etc. receive their value from being perceived... e.g., nobody would pay for a painting they couldn't see, a book they couldn't read.  With software, though, it seems that the source code can sometimes be kept secret -- but still copyrighted -- and the user still receives its value.  The creator gets to keep his codes secret BUT STILL receive copyright protection in the event it's hacked or otherwise becomes transparent.  I think this is a weakness of using copyright to protect software ... (not to mention the ridiculous duration terms.)\r\n\r\nIf it could be adequately policed by USPTO, and I do agree that up until now it hasn't been, I think that patent is a much more appropriate vehicle for software.\r\n\r\nThe other distinction that I'm not sure you took into consideration above is that copyrights only provide exclusivity against those who \"copied.\"  That is, they saw your work and copied it.  With patent, the owner has exclusivity even against someone who came up with the implementation independently.  (The assumption being that there was no need to do so, since the applications, patents, etc. were on file at the PTO)\r\n\r\nTherefore, the person who writes code that's protected by copyright can only protect against someone who copied his source code.  Someone else who thought of the same idea and did it in the same way is free to use (but not patent --(at least currently under the first to invent rule)) his invention."

    body: "It's pretty clear to me that patents have both positive and negative impacts on innovation. The question is when and under what circumstances the benefits outweigh the costs.\r\n\r\nSome argue that they never do, others (like the developing world quote mentioned above) that they always do, and it seems to me that the most probable case is that there are different regimes where one or the other effect dominates.\r\n\r\nRegretably, it's impossible to do real science on this problem, because you can't set up identical circumstances (no control cases!).\r\n\r\nYou can observe that there is less innovation in developing countries and that developing countries have less patent protection, but concluding that one causes the other is hopelessly naive. There are so many different variables involved that all you can hope to do is talk yourself into believing more strongly whatever it was you already believed.\r\n\r\nThe closest you can come is to find pairs of countries which are as similar as possible in all ways except patent law, and then compare objective metrics of innovation in them. Of course, this is very hard, because the most common \"objective metric\" for innovation is \"number of patents granted per year\"!  (I do hope it's clear why that won't work for us here!).\r\n\r\nThat means we're left with hand-waving theoretical arguments (which regrettably is what most of economics is based on). So I don't claim to have a strong scientific basis for my belief, but I do believe that patents have a net benefit when:\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The material cost of bringing an idea to market is high (requires lots of monetary capital).</li>\r\n<li>The material cost of duplicating an idea and marketing it is very low (copies are easy to tool-up for).</li>\r\n<li>There are very limited network effects: no standardized interfaces or formats to worry about.</li>\r\n<li>Reverse engineering is easy (transparency of implementation).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nIn the 19th century most new, patented technology had to interface with the natural world, not other pieces of technology. Reverse engineering of mechanical devices was pretty easy (anybody could look at a new wagon hitch or brake and understand how it worked). While tooling was somewhat difficult, most mechanical systems could be built with more or less the same tools. Thus, it cost a lot to start up a factory, but once you did, that factory could probably make just about anything that could be made then. That meant that \"stealing\" an idea and making copies to undersell the original inventor was a pretty successful strategy.\r\n\r\nToday, the picture is very different. Most technology today must interface with other technology, so any \"patented interface\" is a major hinderance to new innovation. Reverse engineering is now a very difficult and specialized discipline with either software or electronics, requiring a considerable investment in tools and skills. There are also many different manufacturing processes, so it's not so easy to be \"tooled up for everything\", which makes being a copycat artist a bit more difficult.\r\n\r\nWhat these factors together accumulate to is that patented technology now has a much stronger negative effect in that it impedes further progress, while the benefit is increasingly obviated (the patented ideas are so complicated that the process of reverse engineering them is itself protection to the original inventor). And while copying, once you have the original plate, is easy in any printing-derived process (chips, PCBs, software, etc), creating the plate is a lot of work, no matter whether the ideas implemented are new or not.\r\n\r\nIn fact, of course, this means that we are closer to a printing and copyright model: it's not the ideas that are such an investment, but particular implementations of those ideas. It's just fine to have 15 different novels which all tell basically the same story (or many genre writers would be in a lot of trouble!), but not to copy the exact same text. Likewise, it should be fine to have 10 different video cards that all do basically the same thing, but have different chipsets and firmware.\r\n\r\nThere are other industries where the situation is still close to the 19th century case, but IMHO, these are a small minority, and those negative impacts are simply not worth the burden that the patent system is on other industries. The strongest pro-patent case today can probably be made in the pharmaceutical industry, but given the kinds of abuses this system has led to, I can't help but think that we're better off with a non-patent based approach, even there.\r\n\r\n"

    body: "The article initially states that \"the process of turning common lands into shared property, and then into private domains\" is what is meant by the tragedy of the commons, and then conversely goes on to imply that private property is understood as the solution by Hardin, the idea's author. However, this is an inaccurate usage of the idea of the tragedy of the commons. Thus, I'd like to offer a bit of clarification.\r\n\r\nThe idea refers to the overuse and thus diminishing (and possibly the ultimate destruction) of a shared good (e.g., a pasture) when all parties who can access it have no limits placed on their individual use. The tragedy is that without any limits enforced on individual use, the commons will be overused by individuals seeking to maximize their own benefit at the expense of the larger public good. There are concentrated benefits to an individual exploiting the commons, whereas the individual doing the exploiting distributes the costs of his/her exploitation across the commons, thereby harming society as a whole. While Hardin discusses privatization as a possible solution to the tragedy, he concludes that resources are commons and as such are best served by management in the public interest. Indeed, one of the main points of the original academic article is that government is necessary in order to regulate access to public goods. Thus, government must establish limits on logging of forests, emissions from automobiles and power plants, automobile access to urban centers, and so on; ultimately, the point is that humans must be forced to limit their reproduction in order to save the planet, but that's beside the point here. As the Wikipedia entry points out, Hardin's focus is on resources that are unmanaged, and so his article is not an argument for privatization and private property, per se."
