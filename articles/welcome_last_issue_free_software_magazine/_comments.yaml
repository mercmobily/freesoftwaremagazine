And Linux users are much more likely to care about articles than Windows users--a lot of people just use Windows because they have to, and don't really care about learning more.\r\nAnd note that Linux Journal is doing fine as a print publication..."

    body: 'Timmy already hit on the point that I was going make.  Linux Journal is doing just fine.  Linux Magazine left the print market but is still very popular online, as well.  FSM will be fine.  I used to read a couple of other online magazines and quickly became bored because I received an email each week telling me that there was a new edition online.  Unfortunately, most of the articles were written on subjects that I read about months earlier.  Keeping things fresh is hard to do.  Like many Linux distributions, release an issue when it''s ready.  Keep up the good work, FSM.'
