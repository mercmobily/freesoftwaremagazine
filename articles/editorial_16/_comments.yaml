Yes getting forms from the IRS in PDF format may not be sexy but I wouldnt have it any other way. Also, I can't stand printing webpages -- like the ones at your site -- where there are 3-columns and the priting is all screwed up and contains superfluous material. \r\n\r\nAlso, many desktop search engines, including Google, index PDF files fairly well. \r\n\r\nWhile I'm not touting Adobe format specifically, I sure hope that PDF or something like it is around for a while. And personally, I miss your PDF download magazine. If you do even a small amount of research on marketing in general, and online marketing specifically, you will see it always a wise move to give your \"customers\" more options in tead of less; especially when it doesnt really cost you much. The more ways you put yourself out there (PDF, podcast, online, traditional media) the more people you attract, and then they WILL go to your website and read and click on banners, etc.\r\n\r\nAs far as paper being dead in general, I'm not sure that will ever (i.e. our lifetime) be the case, but I have big hopes (and interest) in companies like ePaper. I consider it the Clavinova of paper - it has the same look and feel as the real thing, but all the advantages of electronic media. \r\n\r\nKeep up the good work. "

Sorry - I just don't see that in the current format. Yes - I would read some of it online but the bulk of the reading was offline - carried around on a flash drive or emailed. Another big advantage of the PDF format was that, even when the FSM site was being hammered by folks wanting the new issue, one only had to put up with the sluggish response until you had the issue downloaded and then you could get out of the way! If today is any indication of the site response to online only access, I don't see how many would have the patience to repeatedly go throught the wait and \"server not responding\" messages to read each article. \r\nJust wish you would reconsider.\r\nThanks!\r\n"

I was once an avid reader of TUX, once distributed for free in PDF format. It wasn't that they started charging for it, I could care less about that, as I still maintain paper magazine and newspaper subscriptions. ( The WSJ ain't cheap!) It was more akin to their own arrogance. You see, they didn't listen to their own clientele. The letters to the editor were littered with complaints about their obvious KDE bias and all they did was denigrate those who would espouse any other GUI and proceed with elegant flourish about how great their pompous asses and their \"magazine\" was! When it came time to ante up for a paid subscription, I simply let it fall by the wayside. Why on earth would I continue to use a resource that doesn't serve me, let alone pay for it! You think I'll be paying for it by seeing some banner ads on your site? Phhhht! Adblock is always on! I am always connected (When the computer is on.) but I don't necessarily want my browser open all the time, nor do I find it convenient to print out a web page. That says nothing about the royal pain of editing out the GARBAGE that doesn't pertain to the information I'm seeking to print.\r\n   I remember comparing lines of code in FORTRAN from green and white, continuous feed paper to beige punchcards that actually fed the program into the the computer for my father when I was twelve. That was back in the '70's, before any of you nitwits had the first clue what a computer was , let alone Pong, videogames and free software! Most simply put, an OS is an OS, software is software (I have more linux machines than windows) and a magazine is just a flipping magazine! TV didn't kill radio anymore than computer access to the internet is killing print. What will eventually kill print and make online magazines like this one nothing more than another website to Google is the same thing that is now killing radio. Listening to the whining of a few fat cats who aren't making quite as much of your money as they are used to stealing from you! All that counts is living, loving, laughing, learning and putting out a product that actually serves you and those you are seeking to serve. Bring back the PDF!"

While I will now occasionally stumble upon your web site as a result of searching on a specific topic, the incentive to put forth an effort to visit (to download your content in its entirety) is now gone.  I have a few thoughts about the advantage to you that the PDF brought.  Personally, I have become conditioned to ignore ads online.  Generally, the only ads that get my attention are the ones that annoy me to the extent of producing negative emotions about the subject of the ads.  Print ads, however, seem to grab my attention as they are part of the flow of a magazine as opposed to the interruption of a web page.  Therefore, I notice all of the ads in the PDF version, whether they refer to something that is relevant to me or not.  They actually give your content more value as far as advertisers are concerned when my eyes are taken into consideration.  Also, with the online version of your magazine, I will be likely to leave shortly after arriving, usually going off on a tangent from a topic you have covered or to see what others have to say on the same subject.  With the PDF version in hand, I would proceed to the next article (and the next ad) after reading an article, thus adding value to the ads in the PDF version.  To end, I''d like to thank you for the content you have produced.  I enjoyed it all, whether relevant to my needs or not.  I''m sure I''ll enjoy the content you produce in the future--just a lot less of it.  '

    body: "The thought that PDF is dead really makes me wonder how out of touch the editors at FSM really are.  I've disagreed with many of your articles in the past but always found somthing in each magazine for me to really digest and think about.  But if your declairing the end of PDF when there is so much evidence to the contrary then I must begin to question more then just the ocassional content in FSM.  What relivence does FSM have if they can't even understand the power of PDF's?  What else are they wrong about?  \r\n\r\nPDF is not dead.  I can't even begin to tell you how many of my magazines I wish i could get in PDF format.  It's easy, it's portable, it looks great, and best of all, it allows me to keep many articles together in very little space.  Now, if I want to archive FSM, I have to download every individual webpage and sort it out myself.  I'm not that intrested in FSM.\r\n\r\nOf all the people in the magazine business, i assumed FSM would understand that a few megs of space on a server is not that big of a deal.  In an era where people are downloading hundereds of megs and even 4 gig distros at a time, you would think that 4-6 megs of a PDF would not be that big of a deal.  Apparently it is to you.  So, instead of having the convience of downloading your magazine in a few minutes and reading it when I wish, i now have to boot up my computer and get on the net to read it.  \r\n\r\nAnd for those who don't have great internet connection...it's much more convienient to just download it once, even if it takes longer, and read it off line then hope your connection will get you back on when you want.  It's a total matter of convience.\r\n\r\nI looked forward every month to my PDF download of Tux and FSM.  Now I suppose I don't have either.  I do come to FSM and read the few articles that get put up...but they've only been to satisfy my craving for the PDF mag...you know, somthing to chew on until then.  Now that there's no PDF 'hook' to get me to return every month I don't know what will remind me to come looking for FSF anymore.  Beleive it or not, some of us acutally memorize the URL's of what sites we visit. I don't bookmark any sites.  If your site isn't intresting enough for me to memorize why should I clutter up my hard drive with another file telling me where you are.  Besides, I'm on multiple machines everyday and they are running diffrent OS's.  Just becuase I have it bookmarked on one machine does not mean it's on all my machines.  If I have to use a flashdrive with a portable FF on it, I much rather just have the PDF to begin with. \r\n\r\nThere's been a few times I've decided not to come back to this site becuase I don't always agree with FSM's viewpoints.  But I've always come back and I've always appricited the fact I can download the PDF's and get current again.  Now, if I decide to not come back for any lenght of time, I can't do that.\r\n\r\nI agree with everyone here who wants a return to the PFD articles.  PDF gives the best of all worlds.  You can read when and where you want.  You don't need a connection to view it, and you can even print it when you want too.  HTML files can't say that.  \r\n\r\nI wish you the best of luck with FSM.

However, not many people seem to be willing to print their PDFs.\"\r\nThe comments above should make it pretty clear how utterly stupid this reasoning is.  Did you ask anyone outside of your own organization?\r\n\r\n\"It's easy to point to a specific web page. It's not straightforward to do so with PDFs‚Äîand even if you do, you will have to download the full PDF document to read a specific page.\"\r\nIt's actually very easy if the PDF is put together with links in the table of contents and it's not hard to do.  What's worse is that you have now created a system where you can easily jump to one article, but it will take you 5 print commands to print out the whole article.  I'll take downloading the entire PDF file any day over this alternative.\r\n\r\nThe shame of it is that it's so easy to use CSS to create web pages that will provide the entire article in one printable format.  When you dump PDF using bad reasoning and faulty research, then compound it by not providing an easily obtainable alternative, you end up damaging your credibility as a mouthpiece for free software.\r\n\r\nIt really makes me wonder about the previous comments about Tony's association with Tux and this site.  Tux never listened to the \"subscribers\" who kept saying that their landscape PDFs were bad compared to a traditional portrait format.  Tux never believed either that people prefer to print this stuff.  It's really sad.  The spirit of Open Source is supposed to be about listening to people's needs and responding to those with tools that are actually useful.  This reminds me far too much of the arrogance and fraudulent reasoning of that gang in Redmond."

The PDF version made it easy to keep past issues; web pages make it virtually impossible for individual readers to keep back issues.\r\n\r\nKeep with the new format for a while; I'm sure readers will get used to it.

    body: "Ok, HTML based documents are easy to be built, indexed, modified, etc. On the other hand, pdf's are designed to be read either online or offline, and have the glorious advantage that they can be printed yielding a general appereance that is much more pretty than a printer-friendly HTML.\r\n\r\nBut please remember, as far as i can remember, the issues were produced via TeX/LaTeX and then converted into a pdf version of that document. And to produce a document with the quality that we saw in the former issues of FSM required a very long time, specially at the beggining, when they had to create the TeX macros and in general to set up the beatiful layout of the magazine.\r\n\r\nTony, you and your team really did an amazing job. All of the issues were beatiful. I think that this REALLY was an advantage that FSM had against another magazines about Free Software.\r\n\r\nSo, remember that both HTML and TeX are markup languages. In particular, HTML evolved from the original SGML specification. XML appeared as an alternative to formatting HTML pages, because you can specify the structure in XML and give it different appereances with CSS.\r\n\r\nThen I suggest that instead of creating HTML only and to put a printer-fiendly version, FSM can have it's content's structure specified into XML and then translated into HTML (for your site convenience) and TeX/LaTeX --> PDF for the many readers that REALLY LOVED the PDF version of FSM.\r\n\r\nAlthough the parsing/translation is not exactly a straightforward task, i hope that the community can help to get this done. In that way, you can have your high pageranks and the readers can have all of the advantages that pdf can bring.\r\n\r\nFinally, I don't think PDF nor paper are dead, it's just that their uses are changing as time goes by and as technology and our lifestyles evolve. Even though nor paper nor pdf's are useful for every situation, i think they are to be with us for a long time still. If anyone have doubts just read the comments about those who don't have permanent broadband connections to the Internet, or don't have the time/will to read FSM on a computer screen.\r\n\r\nRegards."

Ofcourse on other OS's pdf isn't used at core but Acrobat Reader & maybe some other solutions brings support for the format with ease.\r\n\r\nEven if not for magazine's, pdf support on your system will at some point be needed cause you downloaded a manual from a support site or from a software cdrom/dvd that you want to read.\r\n\r\nPDF offers password protection, digital signiture & a possibility to control what the reader can do with it (allow/dissallow printing, cut&pasting) & a one file solution. \r\n\r\nHTML could/SHOULD be, if used instead of pdf - as you dicide this, offered for download aswell (preferable zipped) but will exist of one or more html file(s) & a folder containing all other files (ex. gif's). (HTML would be source readable/editable so protection might be possible but easy disabled by someone with html expierience, i think)\r\n\r\nOne more thing about magazine's in pdf format, i think most printed magazine's use if they offer pdf versions & online subscriptions use the same -as printed- adds in the pdf as it will be an ecxact copy of the printed version which had to be composed with Quark or Adobe software anyway. Well maybe google can add support for printed versions of their banners somehow in the future. (Ex: as a Mac user the best axample of such pdf versions of a magazine i have seen is MacWorld US & UK which are darn good magazine's if i may say so )\r\n\r\nWell folks , that's it , hope it wasn't too long\r\n"

(I'd missed the original announcement because I had stopped coming back again and again to Issue 17 in hopes of successful printing. Without printing, FSM has little value for me regardless of how great the content is.)\r\n\r\nI can't get either of these features unless I have enough \"Karma\", but I have no way of knowing how much I need to get these.  I also have no idea how Karma is scored even though the system for recording scores is described.  To add insult to injury, I cannot post a comment to the article that tells us about Karma (or to the forums - apparently I have no Karma).\r\n\r\nI rarely have any comment to add to articles even though I may find them tremendously helpful.  It just isn't a good use of anyone's time to have a page full of comments like \"helpful article\" just so that people can hope they'll accumulate points.  I don't care about the ads, and I'm actually quite satisfied with printing them as long as I can actually read the article text around them.  What I find both interesting and objectionable is putting in place a system that prevents me from obtaining what is offered because it is so convoluted and unrealistic.\r\n\r\nI'd be willing to <strong>PAY</strong> for FSM to get these features.
