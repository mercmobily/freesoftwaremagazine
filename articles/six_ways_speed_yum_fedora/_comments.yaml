    body: "I've used Fedora, RHEL, CentOS and Debian for years and I don't really notice much difference between the speed of apt-get and yum.  No, no... really.  I did find your tips interesting though.  I think skip-broken is on by default in Fedora 10 but I could be wrong.\r\n\r\nI do know that yum does take up a lot more RAM than apt-get/aptitude does... so on machines where RAM is an issue, yeah... it can be a lot slower.\r\n\r\nFor some machines I run local repos.  Why?  Well, I do a lot of package installs and even custom remixes of Fedora... and I maintain OpenVZ OS Templates for CentOS and Fedora... so I find myself installing lots and lots of packages per week... so having a local repo saves a LOT of bandwidth.  It also makes pulling the package headers a lot faster too.  With local/LAN based repos, yum is a lot faster... which leads me to believe that a significant amount of the perceived slowness with yum is just a slower/lower quality mirror system.  In fact I've seen quite a few file not found errors when I use external mirrors... but it doesn't happen very often.\r\n\r\nIt would be interesting to do some timing tests with yum and apt-get using like... the scientific method. :)\r\n\r\nAlso, why does your article repeat itself?  After the conclusion, it starts all over again.\r\n\r\nThere is an apt package in Fedora 9 and 10 but last time I tried to use it, it just segfaulted and didn't work.  smart is also available as a stock package but I haven't tried that one yet and I don't think I want to."
