    body: "Hi all,\r\n\r\nI don't know what Ippi means,but I do know that this thing has really taken off in the months that I've been using the service.\r\n\r\nThe interface is clean and easy on the eye,<what does 'vapidly' mean?:-)> it's NEVER been down since I signed on, it has a cracking 'fwd' facility and of course acts as webmail; I travel a lot so it's handy.The search facility on Ippi's front page is powered via Google, so it makes perfect sense to make it the homepage on my browser.\r\n\r\nI don't normally do this kind of blog thing,but I'm starting to become addicted. I've a sneaking suspicion that I'm becoming an evangalist on Ippi's behalf; if this is so I make no apology!\r\n\r\nI support a couple of charities dear to me, which is fine because whilst I'm an open-source fan and all round lefty,I am flat busted broke! This way I can contribute to the charity of my choice and the open source community at someone else's expense!\r\n\r\nI use Ippi as my main account now, and think of my address as a 'badge of honour'. 'I took some time to make the switch, my e-mail provider is rapidly becoming as important as my choice of wine, but I've never regretted taking the plunge.\r\n\r\nI don't need virus filters, as I don't use W*indoze (can't even type the word yet alone utter it) but Ippi has them anyway for those poor M'soft powered souls.  The Spam Filtering tool is useful too. Oh, and they've just opened a 'shop' so if you buy a DVD for Xmas, a percentage of the sale goes to charity just like the advertising revenue from the site.\r\n\r\nLike they said, it's e-mail for the good guys (and gals) so get on and tell yer mates. I told both of mine(!) and they use it now too\r\n\r\nHappy Xmas!\r\n\r\n\r\n"
