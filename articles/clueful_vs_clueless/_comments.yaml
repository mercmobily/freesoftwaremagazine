As a newbie, one of the most difficult things for me was to get someone to answer a question on the forums without being shouted at and RTFM'ed out of them. And I asked my questions AFTER SEARCHING the forum about the subjects.\r\n\r\nSo, maybe, Linux advocates don't realize what a rabid, angry and uncooperative crowd the \"linux people\" can be. And when it comes to \"little people\" contacting open source developers about their products, the usual reaction, at least in my experience, is to treat the user as a parasite that's taking advantage of their art. Not good.\r\n\r\nIn terms of support, I preferred the indifference of Microsoft to the anger of open source. We have a VERY, VERY LONG way to go in this regard.\r\n\r\n"

    body: "In general I agree with your comments.  However, the problem goes beyond the IT world.  It has been my experience that many of the failures of IT projects can be traced to IT burn-out caused by having to deal with brain-dead lusers in other departments.  Eventually, most IT people, who have to deal with users outside the IT world, end up feeling as though they are repeatedly banging their heads against a wall and simply go through the motions of project implementation instead of trying to actually solve the problems that crop up.  I can't say that I blame them for reaching this point.\r\n\r\nI know of no other profession in which the practioner is supposed to learn everything there is to know about someone else's job, so as to be able to help that person do his job better, while the person receiving the help is allowed to believe that they shouldn't be required to learn or do anything new.  There were too many times in my career when I ran up against this.  End-users seem to believe that they shouldn't be required to know anything about how to use the tools that IT gives them.  It's as though they expect to instinctively know how to use any complex tool or perform any task more complicated than opening their mouths to eat.  \r\n\r\nI think that IT departments need to recognize this phenomenon and develop some sort of rotation system to reduce the day-to-day stress of dealing with stupid end-lusers.  Perhaps something akin to a baseball team's bull-pen should be put in place wherein any given developer/analyst/prograammer is only required to directly talk to end-lusers once a week.  It's my experience that most IT people do want ot expand their knowledge, increase their ability to solve problems, and genuinely want to help others.  It's the continual exposure to end-lusers who can't be bothered to learn that the data they see resides somewhere other than on their PC, or won't learn that randomly deleting files \"because I don't know what they are\" is a bad idea, or who won't understand that email sent from home won't be in their \"sent-mail\" folder at work, etc. that eventually drives most IT people to despair.  Personally, I think it says a lot for the intelligence and restraint, of most IT people that we don't frequently hear of programmers running amok and LARTing every end-luser they can find.\r\n\r\nNow, none of this is to dispute your contention that IT management can often be extraordinarily bad.  I put a lot of the blame for that on the business schools of this nation which teach, by and large, that you don't have to understand anything about technology in order to be able to \"manage people\".  The number of IT managers with MBAs who have no clue about what they're supposed to be running is far too large.  It's those managers, who seem to think that people are little identical \"functional blocks\" that can be plugged in and out of projects without affecting the outcome, that need to be weeded out and sent into the darkness where there is \"wailing and gnashing of teeth\".  IT managers who have come up from the ranks, provided they have the necessary inter-personal skills to deal with others, seem to be the most effective.  \r\n\r\nIt's the MBAs who parachute in from outside an organization, have no knowledge of the corporate culture, no regard for the individuals whom they manage, and view their current position only as a stepping-stone to bigger things, that are one of the prime problems with IT today.  They're the ones, with the grandiose visions of \"let's integrate everything using MS IIS, SQLServer, and Access\", that cause the problems - because they don't understand the technology.  This lack of understanding makes them easy marks for the glitzy sales presentations, the opinions of the Rob Enderle's of the world, and the FUD that MS puts out about any competitor.  It's these types that cause the biggest morale problems among IT departments because of the hare-brained decisions they make in the vacuum caused by their lack of knowledge and the echo chamber of their egos.\r\n\r\nIf IT is ever to be truly useful then business must make an effort to do three things.  First, require that all end-lusers go through some sort of educational process that will teach them the basics of the technology they need to use to get their jobs done.  They don't need to be experts, but they do need to know that the CD drive is not a frigging cup-holder, that unplugging network connections will cause their applications to fail, and that there is no \"Any\" key.  Next, businesses must make an effort to relieve the stress caused from IT people having to deal day-in and day-out with lusers.  This may require, gasp, staff increases - it's unreasonable to expect that IT people can continue to absorb new tasks and responsibilities with every staff cut or change in technology.  IT professional burn-out is a serious problem and needs to be dealt with.  I wonder if anyone has ever done a study of how much it costs to continually bring in new IT people to replace the ones, with experience in an organization, who have burned-out and left?  My gut tells me the costs are significant not only monetarily, but also from loss of knowledge and the inefficiencies that result because the new people need to re-learn the skills the veterans took with them when they left.  Finally, businesses need to develop career-paths within their IT organizations that will retain experienced people and allow for the development of IT managers from within the ranks of those who actually know what the they are doing with technology.  If the necessary management people cannot be found in an organization then that organization needs to make a serious attempt to hire outsiders who have actual hands-on technical knowledge and not be content with hiring an MBA \"because they'll be managing people, not machines\".\r\n\r\nJust my $.02,\r\nRon\r\n\r\nThe problem with the U.S. is that the people fear the government\r\nmore than the government fears the people. - Me\r\nGnuPG key available at: pgp.mit.edu"

I also use open source software, quite a bit.  I know Windows better than 90% of my colleagues, but most of this knowledge is nice-to-know, not need-to-know.  On Linux, it seems like I need to devote much energy learning system-level stuff, while I really care about application-level stuff.  Yes, apt-get and the like are much easier to deal with, but the gist of my remarks still hold - you have to know/tweak too much stuff for the average user.  Not for the average sysadmin mind you.\r\n\r\nThinking that other people who aren't up to speed on Linux are idiots, as your post indicates, is symptomatic of why Linux on the desktop is not happening yet, despite its impressive capabilities.  And also hints at why I know a number of open source programmers who prefer Macs.  Most of the non-Linux users are not interested in dealing with system-level issues.

Which basically means the 'clueless' (which you described) are the ones who shout the loudest, play the political game - and then they take the credit, and the hard work of the talented goes un-noticed and un-rewarded. Also, they may make it difficult for newcomers (with a clue) by denying them the essential knowledge they need to get the job done for which they have been hired.\r\n\r\nWhilst you may know everything about a particular programming language / framework / application / network service / networking stack (or could pick it up overnight, given the opportunity), there are those who don't (who you have quite rightly branded the 'clueless'). These people are apt to feel their position threatened by those with a clue - which is kind stupid in itself, as management are almost always in the worse position to judge who is worthwhile, and who is full of BS. Management, in a fit of ignorance, may judge this person as under-performing.\r\n\r\nWhat's even worse though, is that if a talented person leaves, most of the time the project carries on 'as normal' until something gets forgotten about, and it's only then that people start saying \"we need so-and-so to do this\". Then, of course, in come the expensive contractors.\r\n"

    body: "I posted the following on the Birmingham article.\r\n\r\n###\r\nThis wasn't about Linux v. Windows. There is no competition there among the competent.\r\n\r\nThis was about incompetent leadership.  In the early 80's, I attended a Mensa meeting  in Iowa. The man who helped found Parson's Technology came out of curiosity. He told us something about the computer industry.\r\n\r\nLater, a national company, by memory Westinghouse but I may be wrong, made a big change to its national finance computer, which meant they had to frantically hire a lot of temp programmers, who told  us the same thing.\r\n\r\nIf you take the computer programmer who can write and document the minimum number of lines a day, and set that number equal to 1, the best programmers are 25's. That is, the best programmers can do as much in one day as the worst can in nearly a month.\r\n\r\nHere are two strange things connected with this.\r\n\r\n1.  Almost all supervisors of programmers are 3's.\r\n\r\n2.  No one over a 10 can keep his job working for a 3. They either become temp programmers and come in when the nincompoops fail and fix things. Or, they start their own companies. Or they tend bar. But, they don't work in large organizations.\r\n\r\nClearly, that was the case at Birmingham, proved by their failure even to google for help.\r\n\r\nThey could have had a good system rapidly and free, by simply contacting the Computer Club at the local high school and asked for help from the smart kids there.\r\n\r\n###\r\n\r\nAs far as Linux being hard, there are different distros. Any newbie who starts out with Debian deserves everything bad which happens. I am here right now with Puppy 2.10. It is a small live CD, and runs in RAM with only 71MB size. I can watch videos, listen to audio feeds.\r\n\r\nAnother problem is, people buy their Windows computers pre-installed, all set up by the vendor team. Then, when they try to install a Linux distro on that same computer, they say, \"Gosh, it's harder to install an entire distro than to turn a switch to ON.\" Yeah, I suppose so.\r\n\r\nThe real problem is not with Linx technically, but the market. Most really good apps aren't ported to Linux simply because the demand is small, because the good apps aren't ported to Linux, ad infinitum, ad nauseum.\r\n\r\nMost comments on the future of Linux are related to the English speaking rich nations, as if they were the only users in the world.  Increasingly, poor nations are moving, albeit slowly, to Open Source, as a matter of resistance to seeing billions of dollars flowing to the US, and their young people having no programming jobs at home.\r\n\r\nThere will be more, and as a result, either good apps will be written for Linux by those nations, OR the vendors of good apps will be economically forced to port.\r\n\r\nAs far as rude and surly Linux people, the answer to most newbie questions will get hundreds of thousands of hits via google.  Yet, day after day, newbies come on forums with the same exact questions:  How do I install my tar.gz file?  How do I shut my computer down?  I am very patient, and when I have time, I will answer the same question a hundred times, which is why before I retired, I spent a lot of time at work teaching assembly operators, almost all their first contact with a computer, basic computer usage. As long as I got paid, I could repeat myself all day...\r\n\r\nAnd, there are forums who are nicer. But, most have Stickies at top, telling newbies how to search first, and how to post. It is much faster to read a google hit, than for another person to spend fifteen minutes typing in letter at a time, the same information just for you.\r\n\r\nTry a live CD first. Ubuntu or Kubuntu or Pclinuxos are real popular for newbies right now.  When they become stable, Freespire will be a really good alternative.\r\n\r\nThough competent people can save a lot of money with Linux, the real advantages are: virus free (not because no one writes v. for Linux, they have written 800, they just can't get past the permissions); trojan free; no licensing or auditing problems;no restrictions on free speech (your MS license prohibits you from making comments about benchmark comparisons with other OS unless you run their approved tests!!!!!!! Look it up.)\r\n"

    body: "This article and the commentary with it was very interesting.  I would agree that IT is in a bit of a bad state especially given the fact that I have had to repair everything at my location due to 10 years or more of neglect and the hiring of individuals who had no clue what they were doing.  I am currently seeking employment however every single job requests certain qualifications aka MSCE or some such nonsense which is the biggest joke I have ever seen.  I interviewed for one position with a supposed fortune 100 company that could not even figure out how to network their printers and had purchased a software aka cups and samba that was not working.  This corporation had a ton of IT people yet they could not figure out how to add a network printer or use cups, at present they are still working on the problem.  The best part are the recruiters and the interview process, clueless would be an understatement, how can someone who has no idea about IT be in charge or interviewing for an IT position.  In agreement with a previous comment the individual who can talk a big game is often the one what does not know what the hell they are doing needless to say most IT individuals especially in an elevated position have an extremely minute understanding of what systems they have or how to operate them.  In my previous position I have had to literally chew out every single management individual because they had no clue about what to do when a problem presented itself.  I often sit at my office and go through the myriad of proposals to outsource this and that, or buy this and that, not once have I approved any of these purchases or even given them the time of day.  I prefer to describe the IT landscape as extremely ubiquitous, the majority of  IT agents are drones and the truly gifted individuals who actually can think outside the box are often reprimanded rather than given the tools they require to innovate.  It takes innovation and critical thinking to come up with new ways of doing things and to also create wonderful things that is of course the nature of the open source world.  The majority of individuals never being satisfied with the banality of the normal world have endeavored to create something different which requires that individuals apply themselves and LEARN new things instead of the constant repetition.  The key word in this equation is one's ability to learn, if  you cannot learn from your mistakes or do not wish to better yourself then yes \"linux\" aka *nix can therefore be considered hard.    You may critique this distro from that distro, however in the final analysis the failure and success of your learning endeavor solely rests on your own shoulders.  If an individual chooses to remain in the dark and refuses to LEARN then they are inevitably doomed to their faith.  I personally could not imagine my life if I just sat at my desk being happy with the status quo, say what you will about the open source community, good or bad, I love the fact that we can have these debates and do the most important thing in the world which is to COMMUNICATE.  Agree, disagree, it is all good, just remember to be thankful that we are afforded the opportunity to express ourselves and that we all have a choice in life.\r\n\r\nDoppelGanger"

It was said they should better google their way to the answer so not other people would have to spend a lot of time writing the same answers. \r\n\r\nBut unfortunately, If you don't know the right terms to google it can be difficult to get to the right page. I think it would be nice if there existed a more central, generally acknowledged, database for most of the computer/GNU/Linux questions. I kind of a wikipedia on how to use GNU/Linux and other common free software. It could be edited by anyone and the guys who know would write the info only once.\r\n\r\nBecause knowing how to find information is knowledge too. Let's make it easy."

Yet it is not necessary for the law to be expounded upon at length nor is it necessary to insist on specialised vocabulary in order to explain someone's rights and duties, to assess a claim, or sell an asset.  Presumably I am a fool.  I have also worked on selection committees for a wide variety of jobs.  Again, procedures and terminology might be glorified or good sense may be applied.
