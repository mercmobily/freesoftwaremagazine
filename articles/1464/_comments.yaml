    body: "I would like a pointer to an article, or to suggest an article topic, that explores precisely for what we use, and could be using, computers.  In the article linked above, \"2006 is NOT the year for Linux on the Desktop\", the author bemoans the fact that it is a challenge to get a variety of codecs or proprietary data systems or hardware to perform under Linux at the level at which they perform under Windows.  \r\n\r\nThere is something about that (to which you refer) similar to why children in non-Western cultures generally perform poorly on IQ tests, i.e. the IQ tests are as much an examination of culture as they are of any metric of intelligence.  Just as in the case of those tests&mdash;which bring to light not the deficiencies of non-Western cultures, necessarily, but the deficiency of the expectations and their fundamental principles&mdash;the relatively poor performance of hardware designed for a befuddlingly bad and popular OS under F/OSS systems should focus attention not on the shortcomings of the F/OSS system, but of the status quo of computer and software usage.  Do we really <em>need</em> every desktop system to be as easily converted to a jukebox as a firewall/router for a home network?  Why should Linux or BSD hope to bloat to encorporate everything for everyone, a motivation that doesn't scale well at all?\r\n\r\nI would be shocked and nigh dismayed to learn that this very approach to the smouldering war hadn't been thoroughly explored already."
