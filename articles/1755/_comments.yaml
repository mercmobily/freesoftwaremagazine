As long as you break everything down to simple steps (and it looks like that's what you're doing) you can't go wrong. \r\nSometimes it can help to do a little mini project like a proof of concept or something on the side, so jou don't get bogged down too much. I know it helps me when working on long projects. Nothing motivates like success.\r\n\r\nDennis"

    body: "> Trying to decide on the best language.....thinking of perl.\r\n\r\nIf there was the slightest hint that you were joking I'd let that go, but as you seem to be serious about it... FOR THE LOVE OF GOD DON'T DO IT! Perl is a horrible hack that happens to work mostly ok for one-liners or throwaway little scripts, but will suck your brain and make you regret the moment you decided to write your first over-hundred-lines program. You know, programs are read far more often than written and perl has been fairly described as \"write-only\" language. Trust me on this, you don't want to decipher a non-trivial 3-months-old perl script, even if you wrote it (let alone someone else).\r\n\r\nSame holds at a lesser degree with PHP since it's more or less a dumbed-down version of perl aimed at web \"programming\". It's the easiest to learn compared to the alternatives if you want to hack a few dynamic pages here and there but as a language is inherently flawed, ignoring all modern language design principles and leaving with you a mess of program logic entangled with presentation (html).\r\n\r\nIf you're looking for a language that keeps a healthy balance between elegance and practicality, learn Python and/or Ruby. Both languages are fairly high level and have more  commonalities than differences; most people's preference to one or the other usually comes down to personal taste. Ruby seems to be somewhat more orthogonal and elegant, Python is currently faster and has much larger standard and 3rd party libraries (though the gap may shrink in the coming years after the hype around Ruby on Rails). My personal preference is python (love the clean syntax and the included batteries) but I'd certainly consider Ruby as a reasonable alternative should I decide to leave python behind sometime in the future.\r\n\r\nHope this helps,\r\nGeorge\r\n"

This is because biology does not run on clockwork (who am I to tell you this? you know it already), so there will be some drift, and your predictions will get less and less accurate further out.\r\n\r\nIt would also help if, instead of calculating the average from all your records right back to whenever, that you only kept a \"running average\", going back say, a year or two at most. That way your calculation will adapt better to drift, and your prediction for a particular date in the future will become more accurate as it gets closer.\r\n\r\nLawrence D'Oliveiro"

John Montgomery has a set on writing Java applets, it'll be a 10-part set when finished (but using Java, so not so useful to you) - but a great example of where we're heading.

    body: "I don't understand this \"hate to read documentation\" mentality. Documentation is <em>vital</em>, if only because there's no way you can hold in your head all the information you need.\r\n\r\nFor instance, while doing any Python programming, I have two pages permanently open in Firefox: the <a href=\"http://docs.python.org/lib/lib.html\">Python Library Reference</a> and the <a href=\"http://docs.python.org/ref/ref.html\">Language Reference</a>. From here I can hop immediately to a relevant page that explains further some point about some code I'm working on.\r\n\r\nIf you're not doing this, then chances are you're not using the language to its full effect. This can manifest itself in code written in a long-winded, roundabout fashion, that could be rephrased much more concisely. In Python, at least, the concise version is often easier to understand and easier to maintain, as well.\r\n\r\nLawrence D'Oliveiro"
