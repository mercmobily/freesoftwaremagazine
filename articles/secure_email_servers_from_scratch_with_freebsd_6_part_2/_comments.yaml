    body: "The problem as I see it with portsnap is that you can't upgrade your src tree -- and seamless upgrading from release to release via make buildworld && make buildkernel is one of FreeBSD's strongest points -- and with one extra line to the cvsup config file it (cvsup) can pull down source and documents -- so it's still more attractive in my eyes\r\n\r\nThough there are strong advantages to portsnap: faster update, no portsdb -Uu after pulling down the ports tree, more secure (signed with keys...etc)\r\n\r\n-Yousef Ourabi"

Naturally, one would stumble across this even at first go, but then again, it might serve well changing it if one wanted a spotless and correct version for print.\r\n\r\nGood day to all, and thank you Yousef for your great article.:)"

    body: "Hello all - I am a complete newbie to FreeBSD and any Unix/Linux based systems.  My company has been a Windows only shop until a change in management.  I followed this article to the \"T\" and am having problems.  When I start Postfix, I get an error that it cannot perform a lookup using the mysql_virtual_aliases_maps.cf file.  I was thinking that maybe the SELECT statement within that file is causing the problem?  I do know that I had to insert my own mail_admin password, which has been done.\r\n\r\nI am fairly certain that the other components are working.  Squirrelmail's \"configtest.php\" comes back stating that the system is working fine.  I can also telnet to amavisd and issue an EHLO command, which returns data, making it seem as though it is working.\r\n\r\nOne last item - can you give some examples of what data actually goes into the database \"mail\"?  I have added users, a virtual domain and aliases.  But some examples would give me a starting point of what the syntax actaully is.  Not the INSERT string to add data to the database, but the actaul way the data is setup to be read.  For example:  if I have a user that has a username of \"jdoe1\" what would his alias be?  And, if the server is currently \"server1.mydomain.com\" which IS the domain that I am looking to receive mail on, what is the virtual domain?\r\n\r\nThe ultimate goal of this server is to make it an external smarthost for an internal Microsoft Exchange box.  I would appreciate anyone willing to give me some pointers there too once the mail system is actually up and running.  I've seen that there are ways to actually pull the AD information using OpenLDAP."
