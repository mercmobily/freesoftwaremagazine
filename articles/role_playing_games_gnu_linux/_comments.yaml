It was released before Nethack, and in some ways is its precursor. I have played Nethack (a.k.a YASD generator), angband ,Tome( a.k.a NPK <i>newbie player's killer</i>) and some other RL, but I always return to the dark hole of <i>Moria</i>"

    body: "\"...as well as the science fiction game Traveller and Steve Jackson’s The Fantasy Trip and GURPS.\"\r\n\r\nThe problem with that is that SJ is very touchy about fanware. It wouldn't be possible, under his terms, to write GPL software for his systems. Been there, done that. i've been playing his games since the late 1980's, and the one thing which pisses me off about him is how protective he is about people sharing material based on his games.\r\n\r\nAnother option which is often overlooked is the Fudge Roleplaying System, which, despite its abstractness, has a HUGE amount of potential to turn CRPG on its ears. It gracefully solves a number of tough philosophical problems with RPG rules, such as combat (and damage dealt) between very small and very large monsters (commonly modeled by lower and higher hit points, respectively). Its generic \"scale\" system applies to many areas of gaming which other systems just seem to hose (namely combat damage, but also movement speeds)."

It spawned two sequels, both of which were just as addictive (or even more!) than the original. There were several different storylines that you could be a part of, depending on what you did and where you went. Graphics were top-down.\r\n\r\nI sadly can't find anything even remotely similar for Linux. If my Mac dies, I'll have no way to play those games anymore! (they aren't OS X native, so they don't run on the Macintels). If anybody knows where I can find a similar game for Linux, please leave me a comment on my blog."

That was until I discovered \"Regnum Online.\"  This is a great looking MMORPG, reminds me of the early \"Everquest\" game, that plays great under linux.  The company goes as far as providing a native installer for all the platforms.  Best of all it's Gratis! (no cost).  \r\n\r\nSo far it's mostly Europeans on the servers, but that hasn't hampered the fun of soloing thru many levels.  Much better than the so called multiplayer modes on most games, where games are hosted on players PC's."
