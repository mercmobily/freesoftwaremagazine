If you happen to be around here a lot, you probably noticed that things have changed a little: last month, we released our new web site (which is the one you are looking at right now) with a much more friendly look. If you happen to have a phone or a tablet, you would have also noticed that Free Software Magazine is now _very_ phone and tablet friendly.

That's the dress. What about the magazine itself?

Well, FSM (as we call it) is going through a big transformation too. We are publishing a lot more contents, and are doing anything we can to make sure our favourite magazine is more and more exciting. My objective, and I won't hide it, is to reach 30,000 Facebook/Twitter/Disapora/Goolge+ friends in the shortest possible amount of time, and to multiply the traffic by tenfold. I cannot set a timeframe: there is a limit to how willing I am to be proved wrong! The dream is 3 months, the feasible timeframe is 1 year, the reality... well, we shall see.

I just wanted to take the opportunity to thank everybody here, and to promise that we shall do our best to move right forward.

Thank you!
