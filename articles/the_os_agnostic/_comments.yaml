NeoOffice is improving all the time, and although you can still see it is OOo, it looks and feels like a \"native\" OS X app (whatever that means) most of the time. Didn't have any crashes even in alpha either.\r\n\r\nHerman, Rotterdam"

For a unified look and feel, OpenOffice.org maintains its look-and-feel across platforms.

Remember the days Cool Edit was shareware (heck there was even a free Cool 2000 version) and did so much more than Audacity does in terms of processing a single file. Who needs all those multitracks? Instead of grabbing all sorts of 'best' awards, those guys should think about the future of the app they're writing. For instance, there is no decent free audio editor for OSX. What are they waiting for? doh\r\n "
