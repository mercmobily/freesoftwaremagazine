In my recent series on [Encouraging the next generation of Hackers](http://www.freesoftwaremagazine.com/taxonomy/term/2048) I looked at the concept and ideas behind the (in my opinion) exciting [Raspberry Pi](http://raspberrypi.org) project.

For those who don't know the Raspberry Pi is a project to produce a credit-card sized computer (with some pretty decent specs) which will be available for £15/$25. Following my articles on here I saw a number of comments on others sites bemoaning the lack of availability of the Raspberry Pi itself. As one commenter put it "I'm sick of reading about this - when will it be available?"

# Good news/bad news

The good news is that now you can buy one! The bad news is you'll need a bit more than £15/$25. Raspberry Pi are auctioning 10 (they have resources for 10000) of their beta boards on eBay. You can read more on this at the [Raspberry Pi blog](http://www.raspberrypi.org/archives/489) but so far the auctions are raising a lot more than the finished products will cost.At least one of them is currently at over £2000!

This tells me at least two things:

1. The demand for these boards is there. We could say that curiosity and novelty factor is driving the auction price up but I think there's at least some evidence to show interest in this project is high from a lot of quarters.

2. As the money raised from these auctions is going direct to the project it is looking more likely that it will be around for the future. I for one think this is great and it again shows that people are willing to support such a project (or at least they don't mind paying so much if the money is going towards it).

# Not just for kids?

I am guessing that not everyone bidding on these is doing so with the idea of producing educational computers. The idea of a small form factor - and cheap! - PC like this will be immediately of interest to sectors such as multimedia and portable and/or wearable computing. I don't have an issue with this (nor I suspect do the Raspberry Pi project) but I would like to see the initial vision for this come to fruition.
