  Everyone wishes that free software licences were shorter.  The good  news from  the [GPLv3](http://fsfeurope.org/projects/gplv3/) process  is that by changing the LGPL from being a whole licence to being an  additional permission that can accompany the GPL, the LGPL has  shrunk drastically and the proposed GPL and LGPL texts, combined,  are shorter than the current GPL and LGPL combined.  But GPLv3  itself will indeed be longer than version 2 is.

  Additional words are necessary to protect against additional  problems, to ensure it works the same across national boundaries,  and to clarify the meaning of the licence.  Since FSF started  soliciting comments in January 2006 about how to improve the GPL,  there have been few or no suggestions as to how it could be  significantly shortened.

  But longer doesn't have to mean more complex.  GPLv3 is simpler in  some ways, and I'd like to describe how it was made simpler so that  maybe some people can see other parts of the licence that those same  principles can be applied to.


*   Clarity of wording: When something is not defined, the reader will  have to check their local laws to see what happens in undefined  cases.  For example, "distribution" was undefined in  GPLv2, but re-labelled as "conveying" in v3 to avoid  clashing with existing definitions of "distribution" in  local laws, and it has been defined.  This should make it easier to  comply with the licence.
*   Clarity of intent: Similarly, GPLv3 adds words to clarify what is  intended to happen in new circumstances, such as described in the  recent piece I  wrote [on  GPLv3 and the EUCD/DMCA](http://fsfe.org/en/fellows/ciaran/ciaran_s_free_software_notes/how_gplv3_addresses_the_eucd_and_dmca).
*   Labelling: Each section in v3 has a descriptive title, unlike  version 2 where each section only had a number.  This just makes it  easier to find what you're looking for.
*   Layout: All related things should be grouped together, and each  clause should be in the section you'd most expect it to be in.

  The number of words needed to ensure that software users had  [the four  freedoms](http://fsfeurope.org/documents/freesoftware) in the 1970s was zero.  There were no software patents,  no DMCA/EUCD laws, software generally came with source code, and  there was generally nothing limiting a person from redistributing  software.

  As software distributors started blocking these freedoms by legal  and technical means, it became necessary for software that was  intended to come with those freedoms to be accompanied by licences  granting those freedoms and requiring others to pass them on when  they pass on the software.

  GPLv1, written in 1989, had 1,500 words.  GPLv2 has 2,300 words.  Draft 2 of GPLv3 has 4,000 words.  The most important implementation  detail is that it has to work in court, and this can't be  compromised for the sake of making a shorter text.  But if you can  see ways to make it simpler, that would be very useful because it's  not only technology lawyers that have to read the GPL, it's software  developers and judges too.
