It shouldn't just be a case of drip-drip litigation and extortion as the patent holders pore over the source code of each victim.\r\n\r\nIf we're not careful Europe will want to catch up with the highly innovative US and also legislate software patents."

Under the US system, if you <em>don't</em> know which patents you infringed, then you can use that as a defence that the infringement wasn't wilful. So if you <em>do</em> know which ones you infringed, then that makes the infringement worse.\r\n\r\nA few years ago the FSF, I think it was, sponsored a study to find out which patents were likely to be infringed by free/open-source software. The consultants they hired came up with a list of about 200. But that was all we were told&#8212;just the number, not the details. Because if anybody involved in those projects found out which exact patents they might be infringing, then bang goes their chances of defending a lawsuit.\r\n\r\n<P>Lawrence D'Oliveiro"

There <em>are</em> intelligent Republicans who understand where the future is leading us. We (meaning geeks and free software enthusiasts and free software businesses) need to find out who they are, and work closely with them to help them craft intelligent, forward-thinking (that's a phrase they love) policy.\r\n\r\nMr. Gingrich's quote sums up exactly how we need to approach the Republicans. We need to convince them that software patents increase bureaucracy, which in turn inhibits \"innovation\" (a word that has been co opted by marketers and breathless tech journalists).\r\n"

    body: "Here are some ways of measuring innovation over different periods/geographic areas:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Amount of VC investment</li>\r\n<li>Number of researchers and engineers</li>\r\n<li>Number of new small firms</li>\r\n<li>Investment in R&D by firms</li>\r\n<li>Number of publications</li>\r\n<li>Number of new projects (in free software ecologies)</li>\r\n<li>Number of new standards under development</li>\r\n<li>Number and size of industry events (trade shows)</li>\r\n<li>Number of trademarks sought in high-tech sectors</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nAll these are measurable using modern techniques such as cluster sampling - you take (e.g.) twenty random areas and sample every single firm in that area.\r\n\r\nHowever the patent industry largely drives the debate and it works hard to promote its own studies, which are typically based on interviews with \"stake holders\", i.e. patent holders.  To my knowledge, no-one has done a proper study to measure innovation vs. patents.  It would be a ground-breaking piece of research, and I'm willing to bet that the results would show a \"rabbits and foxes\" pattern, in any given industry.\r\n\r\nSuch a study could also be conducted on historical data, in industries that were heavily patented in the past.\r\n\r\nPoliticians, driven by the easy rhetoric of the patent industry, make the sins of confusing correlation with causation.  Only a few of the above indicators actually has an <em>effect</em> on innovation.  Perhaps publications, and number of researchers and engineers.\r\n\r\nMy thesis is that innovation comes simply from specialisation and competition, the main drivers of all economic activity.  I.e. to get more customers for my bakery, the best way is to specialise, i.e. focus on a particular type of bread or cake, and then innovate, i.e. make that better (and cheaper) than anyone else around.\r\n\r\nSo the best way for governments to drive innovation is to create bigger markets (so that more people can buy my bread), to remove barriers to competition (so that cake making is not a protected monopoly) and to make communications cheaper (so I can exchange recipes with others).\r\n\r\nPatents that cover underlying principles rather than specific products, which includes all software patents, are a barrier to competition, so are bad for innovation.  Patents on bread or cake recipes would be catastrophic for innovation and competition in the bakery industry.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the US patent system is one of the causes of America's loss of competitiveness, falling from 1st place to 6th place last year.\r\n"
