I assume this is just part of the growing pains of moving to the new setup, but just to make sure... a printable view is absolutely mandatory for FSM to be useful.'

You will see ads.\r\nAdvertising is how we pay FSM's bills, and that's how we plan to pay authors in the future.\r\n\r\nNo magazine has ever endorsed the advertising it carries. Advertising is not endorsement, and a magazine with ads is better than no magazine at all.\r\n\r\nBye,\r\n\r\nTony Mobily"

    body: "YES.\r\n\r\nThere is of course, a very simple way to not have advertisements -- produce a version of FSM without ads that you have to subscribe to to see. If people really value eliminating the ads, they'll buy into it.\r\n\r\nOf course, past experiments suggest that such complaints are all mouth -- the previous subscription based models for FSM were not terribly successful. Unfortunately, you have to pay attention to what people do, rather than what they say, in order to know what they really think. That's just the way it is, though -- no worse here than anywhere else.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

I can generally balance my laptop on top of the plastic food so a saveable full copy of the current issue would be magic - I tend to agree with ErnieDV comment on a a \"printable\" version - or full doc in one html page view. \r\n\r\nWould make the journey so much easier - keep up the good work - DaveW"

    body: "Yes, thanks for the lecture on the \"hard rules of business\". You will find, however, that newspapers are generally obliged to label advertising content clearly as such; this site's adverts (in the right hand column) merge into the site content without so much as a disclaimer, so people who don't know what Free Software is might think that \"Shareware Pages - A directory of newest and quality shareware\" or \"Free Downloads - Archive of free shareware and freeware downloads daily updated\" is something related to that topic when we (the insiders) know that this is not the case.\r\n\r\nA simple disclaimer plus some kind of visual separation between the content and the adverts would go a long way to fixing this issue, even if you can't control the adverts on your page. Personally, I can't understand sites who don't try and exercise some control over advertising, but then I'm neither in the publishing business nor looking to subsidise my hosting costs through advertising."
