Thought I'd share, in case there are more people with just half a brain like me reading the article.\r\n\r\n<hr/>\r\n\r\n<strong>From</strong>: Richard Steven Hack \r\n<strong>Url</strong>: www.computerproblemssolvedcheap.com\r\n<strong>Date</strong>: 2006-02-11\r\n<strong>Subject:</strong> At Least One Problem With This Approach\r\n\r\n\r\nBy recommending that you use open source merely for \"incidental\", \"non-critical\" servers, you emphasize in management's mind that open source is not serious software - that it can only be used for minor things.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe simple fact is - this isn't true.  At least some open source software is on a par with commercial software, and certainly a lot of it can do specific jobs adequately enough for most company purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSeoondly, the real issue is convincing management to take a different approach to IT altogether. Almost all IT systems in all corporations are a hodgepodge of thrown-together proprietary systems which don't and can't be made to integrate together, thus reducing the overall effectiveness of the IT investment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is why Service Oriented Architecture is the big buzzword in IT today - it promises to link disparate \"stovepipe\" applications together enabling faster development of new systems, faster reaction to changing business needs, and reduced cost.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut if you use proprietary SOA software - even if it is built to \"standards\" - you're just getting more of the same. Open source is the only answer to this dilemma.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother point is that management needs to comprehend the simple financial point of OSS - that no matter what the cost of conversion, sooner or later the cost of paying for licenses HAS to exceed the cost of conversion. It may be in five years, it may be twenty, but it will happen. You HAVE to pay more for proprietary software than you do for OSS. And that doesn't even take into account other issues such as flexibility, security, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTraining costs for new software are always vastly overestimated by management out of fear of the unknown and the fact that most corporations have no clue how to train employees - which is why they outsource training to companies who also have no clue who charge ridiculous sums to \"train\" employees. Typically, the training occurs weeks or months before the employee has the software on his desk - which means he will forget ninety percent of it when he needs to use it. Thus, the entire \"training\" expense is essentially wasted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe bottom line: as long as management is incompetent and cannot make rational judgements about their own company's policies, open source will have an uphill battle to be accepted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr/>\r\n\r\n<strong>From</strong>: Richard Steven Hack \r\n<strong>Url</strong>: www.computerproblemssolvedcheap.com\r\n<strong>Date</strong>: 2006-02-12\r\n<strong>Subject:</strong> Here's an article equally as useful\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo ways Microsoft sabotages Linux desktop adoption\r\n\r\nhttp://searchopensource.techtarget.com/columnItem/0,294698,sid39_gci1165420,00.html\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMoney quotes:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSix months later,\" 80% of users have and had no problem with OpenOffice,\" Holt said.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the other 20% have fouled the nest. One had some minor issues with a table inserted into a document and others reported number of everyday formatting issues. This vocal minority has rebelled against OpenOffice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe OpenOffice migration is floundering, as, once again, some employees have returned to using MS Word.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMicrosoft's mindshare with some employees has been harder to overcome than the problems with the table and formatting. Holt now knows that the success of an OpenOffice migration can depend on early identification and deprogramming of employees who are fiercely loyal to MS Office. \"Just one person like this may upset the whole project,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow to succeed\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLearning from his own mistakes, Holt offers this advice to IT shops who want to dump MS Office for non-Microsoft desktops:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    * Remove the outgoing office suite and enforce usage of OpenOffice. \"Once someone is used to it, they don't go back,\" Holt said. There has to be a \"no-going-back policy.\"\r\n\r\n    * Talk about success stories to show that others have been able to make the change and like it.\r\n\r\n    * Relate the cost savings to company profitability and potential salary/benefit increases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr/>\r\n\r\n"
