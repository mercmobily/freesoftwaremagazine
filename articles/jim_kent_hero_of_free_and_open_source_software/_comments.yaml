    body: "As an open source developer and former employee of both Celera and it's sibling, Applied Biosystems (ABI), I'm writing to provide a different perspective on both open source and the genome project.\r\n\r\nFor his part, Tony White, CEO of Applera and Craig Venter's former boss claims he fired him because Venter antagonized ABI's customers.  (ABI supplied the gene sequencers used by <em>both</em> the NIH Human Genome Project and Celera).  In fact it was Venter who wanted to give away the sequence and charge only for annotated data on genetic <em>variation</em> among individuals.  It was White who was skeptical of Venter's plan to give away the genome sequence instead of charging for it.\r\n\r\nIn principle we can all agree that nobody invented the human genome, so our gut reaction is outrage that anybody should be permitted to patent it.  On the other hand, it cost Celera half a billion dollars to sequence the genome, and shareholders who fund such ventures have a reasonable expectation of return.  The tax-paying public has other kinds of return in mind when funding medical research, and <em>does</em> expect the data to be made public.  Like it or not though, patent law does provide a financial incentive that in some cases benefits both private and public good.\r\n\r\nBy the way, the public HGP was not founded in response to Celera as the article states.  It was started back in 1987 under the DOE.  However, David Haussler and others admit that Venter's group forced them to retool and complete their project several years ahead of schedule - to everybody's benefit.\r\n\r\nBut back to the question of inventions, IP, and compensation.  At the risk of being crude, let me state two propositions that seem to frame the debate:\r\n\r\n1. All people have a right to make a living in exchange for providing value to society.\r\n2. Inventors (including open source developers) should not be subject to lawsuits over patents of which they are unaware.\r\n\r\nI call #1 the \"quid pro quo\" argument, and #2 the \"presumption of omniscience\" argument.  Both of these propositions seem reasonable in the abstract, yet in a capitalist society, they often come into conflict.  What's amazing to me is that the debate has become so polarized that well-informed people on both sides of the debate act as if the other side's arguments are baseless.\r\n\r\nThose of us who provide their source code at no charge should be aware that it is frequently downloaded and used by \"engineers\" who make six figure salaries, yet wouldn't have a clue how to write it themselves.  We aren't bothered by this or we would stop contributing to it.  Yet open source developers still need to eat.  It's worth noting that Ben Franklin, who refused to patent his inventions invented most of them after he became wealthy from his printing business.  So he made his money not so much from generating information, but for making it widely available.  Would he have been so successful in the Internet age?  More to the point, does the open source movement mean that only aggregators make money, and developers themselves must be independently wealthy?\r\n\r\nAlthough many believe that information should be free (as in \"free beer\"), even more believe that software developers should be free to roam the algorithmic landscape without risking stepping on patent landmines.  The idea that software developers should be presumed omniscient concerning existing patents, and understand patent law besides, is, we all know, lunacy.\r\n\r\nI don't presume to know how to solve the dilemma of \"quid pro quo\" versus \"presumption of omniscience\".  But I do think that no solution is possible as long as either side views the opposing view as illigitimate.  We need to ensure that people who wish to make a living producing useful code have that option, and we need to keep the landscape free of landmines.  Perhaps patent law should be changed to except those who unknowingly reinvent a method or algorithm from patent infringment litigation, with the burden of proving \"foreknowledge and intent\" falling on the patent holder.  However, I don't favor throwing out patent law wholesale.\r\n\r\nHumanity benefits from the Jim Kents of this world, as well as the Tony Whites and Craig Venters, and with such diversity it is indeed a brave new world.\r\n"

However, I don't favor throwing out patent law wholesale.[/QUOTE]\r\n\r\nThis argument is flawed. Patent law as it currently stands is wrong because it blurs the line between idea and implementation. If it can not define that line correctly, it needs to be changed or withdrawn from the realm where ideas and implementation can not be reasonably separated by such patent approval groups.\r\n\r\nNo one is denying any one the opportunity to make money from useful code. What should not be possible however is the ability to patent an idea with no visible implementation. I should not be able to patent \"sorting in ascending order\" without a demonstrable algorithm that performs this function. And the patent should be applicable to my IMPLEMENTATION, and NOT THE IDEA, of \"sorting in ascending order\".\r\n\r\nThis will allow me to sell my fantastic code that \"sorts in ascending order\" while at the same time allowing any one else to develop code that \"sorts in ascending order\" but doesn't use my algorithm.\r\n\r\nThis is real market economics and will facilitate a level playing field allowing innovators to innovate and not allowing me to monopolize the \"sorting\" market place with my sole algorithm. Buyers get to choose which fantastic \"sorting in ascending order\" algorithm they want to incorporate in their product on their grounds - not on mine (the seller).\r\n\r\nYour argument that \"cost Celera half a billion dollars to sequence the genome, and shareholders who fund such ventures have a reasonable expectation of return\" is also simillarly wrong in that it accepts that Celera may want to patent the genome sequence to gain returns for their investment. Any attempt to exploit that which should be available freely for the greater good of mankind is wrong. And Celera wanted to exploit this by getting to the market first. It is good for humanity that tools like GNU/Linux, the Beowulf cluster, the Internet and capable people like Kent are available to take on funded private pirates looking for every opportunity to exploit the ignorant innocent."

    body: "JK work has undoubtedly benefitted all of mankind but I don't believe you can call JK a \"hero of open source\". A \"pioneer for mankind\" would be a more appropriate title for him. I believe that Jim Kent (JK) does not understand \"Open Source\" or the purpose of the GNU's GPL. \r\n\r\nBy releasing his software under a non-commercial licence and claiming to be a proponent of Open Source, he shows me that he doesn't understand Open Source. The <strong>first criterion</strong> of the Open Source Definition states:\r\n<cite> \r\nThe license shall not restrict any party from selling or giving away the software as a component of an aggregate software distribution containing programs from several different sources. The license shall not require a royalty or other fee for such sale.</cite>\r\n\r\nand yet, his actions show that he was willing to forgo this criterion for whatever reason. To me, the failure to adhere to this criterion shows a lack of understanding of the intended purpose of this criterion and therefore it shows a lack of understanding of Open Source.\r\n\r\nJK's responses from his O'Reilly Network interviews show me that he doesn't understand the purpose of the GNU GPL. He says:\r\n<cite>I'm not sure if open source works so well in commercial environments. These days at least, the GPL is absolutely disastrous, since it really doesn't mix peacefully with existing proprietary stuff. </cite>\r\n\r\nNo duh. I believe JK does not understand about giving the user freedom and therefore cannot understand the intent of the GPL. The GNU GPL is designed to ensure the user's freedom. Proprietary software doesn't guarantee any freedom and in fact, it often imposes very strict forms of user subjugation in the name of \"protecting the author's interests\". So it isn't hard to see that GPL licensed software not mixing with proprietary stuff.\r\n\r\nI do agree with his sentiment that the GPL is disastrous to mixing with proprietary stuff. The GPL was designed so people wouldn't impose extra restrictions on top of what was already restricted and therefore ensuring the freedoms that the GPL provided. Proprietary software imposes restrictions that restrict the user's freedom and therefore proprietary software is inherently incompatible with GPL licensed software.\r\n\r\nSo yeah, he's a great guy for doing something that progresses society but he's no posterboy for Open Source.\r\n\r\n"

    body: "First thanks for the kind words.  I was in the right place at the right time with the right skills on the genome project, and ended up with more fame than I deserve compared to other people you don't hear of, like LaDeanna Hillier, Asif Chinwalla, Richard Gibbs, Greg Schuler, and hundreds of other people without whom the public genome project would have never completed in time to avoid wholesale gene patents by Celera and Celera's licensees. I am proud of my role in it the genome project though, and of the work we continue to do to understand the genome at genome.ucsc.edu and elsewhere.\r\n\r\nIt's true that I don't buy the predominant open source models.  I've made money, good money, selling software I've written.  I think writing and selling software is an honorable profession. I think the lion's share of the money in software should go to the people who write the software, not the people who write the manual, since it takes longer to write the software than the manual.  I think that a lot of really good software requires very little support, and in fact in the consumer categories, the better it is the less support it requires. So the model where I write something for free, and Tim O'Rielly makes good money selling books on it, and Red Hat makes money providing phone support for it and burning it on CD just doesn't work for me. \r\n\r\nThe GNU model doesn't work for me, because it's sticky.  After 10 years I think code should go into the creative commons free for all to use.  I think a lot of code should be put there earlier.  However if I spend 2 years writing something that is useful, I think I deserve to profit from it if I want. I don't think that someone else should be able to make a copy on a floppy, or these days a CD ROM or web site, and sell it for 50% of what I'm selling it for.  If I incorperate Gnu code into my code (if I am reading the license correctly at least) I *do* need to open myself to someone who can undercut me in price because they essentially had no development costs.\r\n\r\nThat said, I do think that source code should be freely available for others to read, and for customers to modify in all cases.\r\n\r\nThere are places where the GNU license is useful, where it provides leverage for code to escape from trade secret, or semi-permanent copyright status from a tight fisted company.  Still, personally, I like to divide the world of code I write into that which is given away with no strings at all, and that which I sell to make a living. Now that I'm supported by government grants I can afford to give away *all* the code that I write.  That has not always been true though for me.\r\n\r\nI have been lucky to be my own boss most of my career.  If you are working for someone else,  having to change jobs reasonably often, I can see how the GPL would be extremely attractive. Among other things once the GPL gets it's hooks in, if you contribute to a GPL project, you can keep working on it even after your startup is bought out by Cisco,  even after your enlightened manager gets driven out of the company at Oracle, even after your mature software customization shop gets driven into the ground by the founder's idiot nephew. I've got code I wrote 25 years ago and still use.  Hopefully the GPL will help make it so that the programmers caught in the intellectual property mazes of corperate America can experience the same pleasures of extreme code reuse.  I still think a better solution would be companies that you'd *want* to work for for 10 years at a time because they weren't run by aggressive *ssh*les,  a software license standard like we have with patents that tends to limit royalties on a piece to no more than 3% of the profit on the whole, and copyright laws that expired completely after 10 years.  I guess I'm dreaming.  Maybe in the face of mega-software-corporations GPL is necessary. I'm not comfortable with it's effects on the smaller software shops like I used to run though.  You might ask Walter Bright, Joel Spolsky, or some of the other good small shoppers what they think of GPL. I'm betting their feelings would run pretty parallel to mine, but I've been wrong before!\r\n \r\nTake care,\r\n    Jim Kent\r\n"
