Putting on \"Deer Park\" branding and artwork onto a stable Firefox 2.0 release wouldbe as much work as putting on \"Iceweasel\" branding and artwork and wouldn't be as misleading.\r\nSolution 3)  is hardly what anyone would want - not shipping Firefox-like code?Come on! That's giving up altogether. In fact, Debian's gnome and kde metapackages already do not install firefox but konqueror/epiphany. Still, Debian needs to offer users a firefox-like choice.\r\nSolution 4) is what they though about, since they actually do a lot of backporting work. Certainly the situation would have been better if this didn't come as an inter-project conflict. Still, membership doesn't guarantee one of the essential freedoms of free software: the freedom to modify code at will. The mozilla community might still override their Debian members and disallow them from shipping patches they don't like. Look how heavily patched the Linux kernel is in mostdistros to see why a restrictive patching policy (based on trademark law) wouldn't work.\r\nSo, Solution 5) is the only sane one.

I know, it's unlikely, but still a risk.\r\n\r\nSo while I can understand that some Debian developers don't like being ordered by copyright owners to stop ignoring someone else's licence, they do appear high strung and childish in their reaction: 'IceWeasel' and a sad weasel humping the world put on Firefox' code is not only uninspired, but almost insulting too.\r\n\r\nIt is true however that Mozilla have tightened their hold on the brand name, and done so in a violent manner. However, if they had to wait for all distro's release dates to 'get nasty', they'd never be able to do so.\r\n\r\nI've also read the content of the post made on glandium.org. I'm sorry, but while it may seem logical to link to external libraries when possible, if some of them are kept built-in, it may be because of some stability worries; for example, Gecko may not take as kindly to libpng version 1.13 than it does to libpng version 1.35.\r\n\r\nAs to the libstdc++ requirement, having right now a distribution providing Firefox with its artwork intact yet still linking against libstdc++6, I don't think it stands.\r\n\r\nThe build scripts are another concern, and right there I agree with the Debian developers: if they can be made to support more platforms, then it shouldn't be a factor against them. However, considering build scripts don't ship with final products and actually have no 'real' impact on the generated code, they may not be that important.\r\n\r\ndiff files: well, a 100,000 lines diff may make a lot of sense to the one generating it, but to the developer getting it, it's another matter: why not a diff for the build scripts, one for the actual modifications and one for the Debian tree? Do you expect Mozilla programmers to be intimate with Debian's CVS?\r\n\r\nThe last time such a large patch was posted in a project, it was one supposed to enable 64-bit compilation of Openoffice.org; it was estimated to create so much overhead to QA that they preferred spending months splitting it up. Same thing on Wine when the WineD3D patch was introduced: it was merely copying lines from one file to another, yet the actual integration took 6 months and dozens of patches. Mozdev's objection was understandable.\r\n---\r\nA computer is like air conditioning: it becomes useless when you open windows."

In fact, the GNU project doesn't seem to even provide the graphics used by Debian IceWeasel.\r\n\r\nThe point I was trying to make in my post was that although Debian had several possible solutions open to them, they chose the one that will arguably hurt the most: they created a complete fork and decided to keep it to themselves (don't tell me they keep it 'open', if they did they would do better than provide unstructured 100,000 lines diffs - it's something I'd expect from Apple, not from Debian!).\r\n\r\nDebian ain't GNU; GNU's approach is to reuse the code created by the Mozilla foundation/group/thingie and strip if of intellectual property problems, yet report back modifications they made.\r\n\r\nRight now, Firefox contains 2 non-free components: its artwork (and I made a point about it) and the Talkback extension (can be removed at install or any time after that). Removing Talkback doesn't require a change in branding. Once removed, it's still Firefox. Changing default config options isn't forbidden: they can be accessed post-build through about:config anyway. Adding themes isn't discouraged: several are already provided in the source tarball. What's left? Changing build scripts to support more platforms? Since those are only used to direct the compiler, they are not considered part of the source code anyway - they don't contribute to the binary (nothing prevents you from building the application one library at a time and to pass compile options every time)\r\n\r\nThe artwork. Remove it, it's not Firefox anymore - so don't call it that; however it's not built into the binary, so it could be contained by another package, right?\r\n\r\nLet's say you have 3 packages: deerpark-core-1.8.0.7, firefox-brand-nonfree-1.8.0.7 and iceweasel-brand-free-1.8.0.7; when deerpark is built from unmodified Mozilla tarballs, deerpark accepts both 'brand' packages; when those have been modified, deerpark will require uninstalling of firefox brand package.\r\n\r\nWhat pissed off the Mozilla developers was the 2,345 lines (or something) buried in the 100,000 lines of codes provided upstream; why not provide these lines by themselves? Frankly, if you were working on a multipage record of an extreme importance, someone borrows your copy then gives it back to you saying they made corrections, but without marking them; would you appreciate having markings saying where those corrections are instead of an almost complete copy, with their styles added to yours and polluting your formating?\r\n\r\nWorking on someone else's code is a pain; most projects have different rules of formatting. It's bad practice to take someone else's code and modify the formatting; you provide your corrections in a legible fashion so that, upstream, said fix can be integrated smoothly with the rest of the code and follow their quality insurance guidelines.\r\n\r\nMozilla say that only code that went through their QA can be called Firefox; considering how hard they work to maintain the code, it can be respected. Debian refuse other distributions based off their code (even unmodified packages) to use 'Debian' in their naming.

I think   though that Debian's boatload of package licensing problems (binary blobs, \"source code\" for artwork, kicking out By-SA documentation, etc) is really just proving Creative Commons' point: content really is different.\r\n\r\nAnd if Debian never realizes that, then they'll probably just become increasingly irrelevant until someone else takes over the flagship position.\r\n\r\nI think the reason why Ubuntu will be able to keep the Firefox name is because they will keep the logo, and so they'll be able to seek approval from Mozilla and get it.\r\n\r\nDebian developers complaining about this situation are insensitive to this very real point that Mozilla has about controlling their brand image.

    body: "\"No\", because Ubuntu is based on Debian.\r\n\r\nHowever, \"yes\", because should Debian become too extremist, it's quite possible that Ubuntu could in some sense \"become\" Debian (that is, inherit its pivotal role as the largest \"deb\" distribution or become the most important fork—something like this happened to XFree86 recently when it adopted a license some developers thought was \"non-free\", resulting ultimately in the new X.org fork of X).\r\n\r\nOf course, that isn't really necessary, and Debian would probably continue just fine, even if no one actually used stock Debian on their computers (or only Debian developers did). It might persist solely as a  distribution from which others are derived.\r\n"
