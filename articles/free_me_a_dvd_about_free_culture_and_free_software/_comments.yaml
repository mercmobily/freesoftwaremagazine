    body: "Great idea! I feel very much the same as you about 'Free Culture'. It really is a broader movement, but sadly most of the participants don't know what all the rest is doing and thinking. e.g. CreativeCommons not using free software... or Free Software advocats not valuing OpenAccess...\r\n\r\nActually, I'm writing on a smaller project which's aim it is to give a good and simple overlook over this movement, especially suited for newcomers. If it turns out well, I'm going to publish it on the 'Net and possibly set up a wiki, so participants from all over the movement can bring in their knowledge, change the text and maybe form also a parallel, more comphrehensive version."

    body: "This sounds like an interesting idea.  I would like to say a <strong>great</strong> idea, but the fact is that I am ignorant enough of the broader free culture scene that I wouldn't be able to say that until I actually see the DVD.  Which I would like to.  Since you wish to be paid for cost of postage, perhaps on your web site you could list estimates of what this would be for various areas.  (Perhaps some ranges for each broad geographical region.)  I live in the U.S.A. and I have no idea what postage might be.  I would imagine there would be others over here who would also be interested in your DVD.  You also might publish on your site acceptable payment methods.  (Not everybody has Paypal or credit card.)  I would think posting this info might cut down on the amount of email you would need to handle.\r\n\r\nThe other thing I would like to see addressed is the legality of duplicating and giving away copies of this DVD.  I am guessing everything on it has no issues with noncomercial redistribution.  But my impression (which may be wrong) is that just because all of the content may be redistributed, that does not necessarily hold for the DVD as a whole.  (This may also vary by country.)  If you wish to grant the right to duplicate and distribute, publishing it on your web site as well as having a file on the DVD stating this would be great.\r\n\r\nGood luck with this project."

    body: "I completely agree that anything which doesn't allow commercial use isn't free as in freedom. However, I don't agree that that's an unpopular position. I know that Lawrence Lessig says a work which bans commercial use is free, but I don't think the majority of people in the free culture and free software movements agree with him. I definitely hope they don't. I also don't think that any work which doesn't allow derivative works is free.\r\n\r\nThe Definition of Free Cultural Works (http://www.freedomdefined.org) is more or less identical to the free software definition, and it seems to be becoming the most popular of that type of definition. Richard Stallman has even added a link to it on the free software definition page.\r\n\r\nI think that including partially free stuff in this DVD is OK (as long as it at least allows noncommercial distribution) if you think it's useful to do so, as long you make it completely clear which works are completely free and which works aren't, and you include a definition of what you think constitutes a free cultural work (whatever that may be).\r\n\r\n--\r\nGNU - free as in freedom"

    body: "I looked over that wiki page and I think from my intentions that I should be OK including NC stuff from the point of view of legal issues.\r\n\r\nThe moral issue however is trickier. \r\n\r\nI recognised this problem when I started and gave it some thought; the conclusion I came to was to include the NC licensed materials because I believe they add genuine value to the DVD and to our culture as a whole - but I felt it was important to let people know that other people have different views of what constitutes a Free work, hence I've added a paragraph on the welcome page dedicated to this point and recommending that people look around the sites I've linked to, including Free Software Foundation and Freedom Defined. \r\n\r\nThe reason I feel these works add value is because even when licensed non-commercially they facilitate a massive expansion of what is available for the public to access: they allow people to learn from them, they allow people to be creative, to create derivative works, and they allow for a true historical record of our society as it is now and what it will develop in to. The other point is that even NC licensed material, from looking over that wiki page, allows you to charge for the costs of distribution under certain conditions and so doesn't restrict people's access to this. \r\n\r\nThis is at least my take - I hope I've expressed myself clearly but I doubt it!! Feel free to e-mail me or keep posting replies, discussion like this is good I think :D \r\n\r\nJon\r\n"

    body: "<cite>I also don't think that any work which doesn't allow derivative works is free.</cite>\r\n\r\nIt's probably not. But even Richard Stallman argues that derivative works aren't always a good thing. He devides works into functional ones, works of personal opinion and creative works. Many of his texts representing his personal opinion aren't under a derivatives-allowing license, but only verbatim copying is permitted. I think this does make some sense: he doesn't want his text completeley changed and still be made responsible for its content."
