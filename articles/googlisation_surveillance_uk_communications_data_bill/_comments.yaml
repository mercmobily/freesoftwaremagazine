    body: "Couldn't agree more with this article, it has long been obvious, to us Brits who have left the UK for a better life elsewhere, that this is the direction the UK state is going.\r\n\r\nOne error though, you say 'The government will tell you that the primary object of the bill is, of course, the monitoring and detection of paedophiles and terrorists. No British citizen, including this one, has any problem with that at all.'  Of course some British suspects have problems with it, the paedophiles and terrorists, but they probably already take measures to circumvent tracking."
