I started it in 2001. Since then I've tried/used/scrapped somewhere near 50 different systems. Most of them suck in one way or another. If you already know you like drupal, then find a host that'll deal with it. 25 simultaneous connections isn't unreasonable, but I *would* love to know which routines are causing all the connections. One stupidly written 'foreach' loop could be enough to make 10x the number of required DB connections :-) \r\n\r\nbrian."
