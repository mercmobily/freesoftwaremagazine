I would suggest a focus on what linux does better and not how much MS is perceived to suck.  This behavior is not productive at all.  I also agree that install.exe does not seem suited to a corporate setting.  Companies have policies to protect their data, intellectual property, and anything else others might want.  \r\n\r\n  However, install.exe would surely be more beneficial in a home environment.  I do run linux exclusively on my computers, ny wife has a laptop running XP.  However, if we were sharing a computer, using something like install.exe would seem ideal as it would allow me to play with linux without permanently altering the computer.  It would also give me read AND write access and be much faster than any liveCD.  Used as a tool to get windows users to try something else, it can be great.  However, trumpeted as the savior of linux it will never live up to expectations.  People really need to see it for what it is and don't treat it as the holy grail."

Large numbers of people in the Linux camp are refugees, they didn''t end up here because of ideology or technical merit, they simply hate Microsoft, and will use anything that doesn''t support Microsoft, those people are going to have bad things to say about Microsoft at any given opportunity. The idea that the Linux community needs to "grow up" and stop bashing Microsoft is odd, since the daily defectees are often only coming over to be able to more meaninfully bash Microsoft. Mature members of the community probably shouldn''t be touting overly simplistic ideas like "M$ sucks", but they should probably be explaining why taking money from end-users to reduce their freedom is evil. While introducing a click-installer to the world without specific plans to support them after they do actually click and install might be irresponsible, but since we have only recently gotten remotely stable access to NTFS and its been shipping by default for a while now (maybe as much as 7 years) I don''t think the specifics can have been worked out, but noone is advocating orphanning the people who try this out.

See how to do this below.\r\n\r\nDisclaimer: As a safeguard you should always perform a backup of your system to an external source prior to performing any changes such as outlined below. I am not responsible for any data-loss or other issues you may experience when using the information below to install Linux.\r\n\r\nAbout GParted: The GParted utility is an easy-to-use yet very powerful graphical Open-Source partition editor that is available in \"LiveCD\" format(meaning that it boots from CDROM).\r\n\r\nTo use a \"LiveCD, download the *.iso file and then use your favorite cd-burning software to burn the .iso image to a cdrom disk (My favorite cd-burning app for Windows is DeepBurner Free 1.8 from http://deepburner.com/?r=download for Linux use K3B).\r\n\r\nHere are the steps that I used to \"Shrink\" my Windows partition with a nifty utility called \"Gparted\". I was then able to install KUbuntu 7.04 in the free space that was left over.\r\n\r\n1.) Download and burn to cdrom the free Gparted Partition Editor Utility in LiveCD format http://gparted.sourceforge.net/download.php (direct link to the gparted-livecd-0.3.4-7.iso file: http://tinyurl.com/24ph7r)\r\n\r\n2.) Boot into Windows, perform a full disk cleanup (checkout www.ccleaner.com for a good cleanup utility for this), then run a full defragmentation of your Windows drive(s) to move all the physical data on your hard drive and provide room to \"Shrink\" the Windows partition.\r\n\r\n3.) Boot up your computer to the GParted LiveCD (from Step #1 above). Upon booting into Gparted, try pushing Enter to accept the defaults at each of the configuration screens - this will get you into the GParted graphical utility, which is very simple to use.\r\n\r\n4.) To \"Shrink\" your Windows partition, simply right-click it from within the GParted graphical utility, then select \"resize\". From the resize dialog simply use the slidebar to adjust the size of your Windows partition to a smaller size (slide to the left or enter a number). Be sure to leave some free space for Windows (4GB or more would be great)to avoid Windows performance problems. For Kubuntu you can set aside 4GB of free space for the install. I suggest that you free up 20GB or more to have plenty of space for using Kubuntu.\r\n\r\n5.) Click \"Apply Changes\" and watch the magic of the GParted as it performs a \"Shrink\" of your Windows partition. Note: GParted may not work properly if you have any type of RAID array, so you're on your own for testing that.\r\n\r\n6.) After all changes are applied, reboot the machine without the GParted disk in the drive. Windows will then perform a \"chkdsk\" - this is normal, let it complete. Note: Be sure to let the chkdsk fully complete and then login to Windows to test to see that everything changed properly. If you look in \"My Computer\" it should show that your Windows partition is now smaller. If you were to run Start>Run>diskmgmt.msc , you would see that your drive now has the free space you created in steps 4 & 5 from above.\r\n\r\n7.) Reboot with the Kubuntu LiveCD in your drive, once you get to the point where you can install Kubuntu you can install the linux partitions (swap, and / (e.g. ext3 root)) in the free space you created. Kubuntu will automatically detect your Windows partition and will add it as a selection for the GRUB Boot loader.\r\n\r\nHave fun using Kubuntu - I use it on all my computers and I think it's great!!\r\n\r\n\r\nShannon VanWagner\r\n"
