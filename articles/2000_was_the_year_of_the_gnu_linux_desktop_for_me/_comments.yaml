    body: "The GNU OS as envisioned by RMS was to include everything and the kitchen sink, which led to the creation of the glibc library, gcc and a bunch of other stuff by the Free Software Foundation. The GNU kernel is officially Hurd (in development), but it couldn't be finished soon enough. Right now, working implementations of Hurd are referred to as 'GNU/Hurd'.\r\n\r\nInitially, Linus Torvalds designed Linux (the kernel) to replace Minix' kernel (it couldn't do virtual terminals at the time, or something), and he added the working pieces from the GNU project (pretty much everything - but the kernel, obviously). Many GNU elements have been replaced or rewritten, still there are a few remainings: glibc and gcc (grub sometimes, too) at least - and since RMS basically wrote the original implementations of these programs himself, he may have a right to defend his work - thus the occasional use of GNU/Linux.\r\n\r\nConfusing? At first, but not as much when you know the reasons. Just consider that a desktop/server Linux environment using parts of the GNU project may be called GNU/Linux (Linux for short), while Linux by its lonesome can refer to the kernel, a standalone micro-OS or be a nickname for a complete system. At least it's not as virulent as the Net/Free/OpenBDS wars...\r\n\r\n(Auth. Note: the above part was in answer to the first published version of the article. Since the article has since been modified and made the first part look out of place, I've re-edited the comment to reflect the change - Thanks to Dave Guard for allowing it).\r\n\r\nNow, to the 3D desktop in Vista: I tried it. I found it:\r\n- a resource hog,\r\n- a very slow piece of code,\r\n- a non-innovative interface (there is very little practical use coming from the 3D stuff).\r\n- a confusing addition (the useful content is buried under eye-candy, lacks legibility and is non-instinctive).\r\n\r\nCompared to 3D managers such as Compiz on Xgl, which was:\r\n- fast,\r\n- small (10 Mb RAM footprint at most on a 64-bit system),\r\n- innovative (transparency can be used to read text from a window underneath your text editor, a simple key will convert the desktop into a mosaic, cube-shaped desktop switcher etc.),\r\n- non-intrusive (you can use your desktop environment the way you did before, and make use of the new stuff as you see fit).\r\n\r\nWell, I was drooling on my keyboard all the time I used it.\r\n\r\n---\r\nA computer is like air conditioning: it becomes useless when you open \r\nwindows."

    body: "Actually, I'm familiar with the derivation of \"GNU/Linux\" and I've read the justifications for it, but I do have some problems with it. Though my real problem is not with the expression itself, but Richard Stallman's draconian and hypocritical assertion that it is \"incorrect\" not to use it every single, bleeding time you refer to the O/S.\r\n\r\nHypocritical? RMS? 'He never does that!', you say.\r\n\r\nBut consider -- the GNU system is basically a clean-room implementation of someone else's basic idea (the Unix operating system utilities, as represented in both proprietary and free Unix versions). Furthermore, the graphical environment is provided by X, which pre-existed on the Unix platform, is not and never has been part of the GNU project, but is instead under a non-copyleft free license.\r\n\r\nBecause of that, the GNU project was free to appropriate the X environment to solve a very big need -- which is the graphical workstation or desktop environment.\r\n\r\nAnd there are other examples.\r\n\r\nCollectively, what they mean is that \"GNU/Linux\" is not especially more correct than saying \"Linux\".  Both are refering only to a tiny part of what we really mean, which, if fully enumerated, would be totally unusable as a label: Debian GNU/Linux 3.2 \"Sarge\" contains far more than 10,000 packages -- most of them maintained by independent developers, not associated with the GNU project or the Linux kernel developers.  Perhaps I should write a Python script to generate an appropriate label by concatenating them with slashes?  I certainly wouldn't try to do it by hand.\r\n\r\nNothing is wrong with any of that, of course. Those things were made available as standards or placed under free licenses with the intent that they should be 'appropriated'. And of course, RMS is extremely vocal and demonstrative about his  gift to the intellectual commons. He would have us believe that he's a selfless crusader for software freedom.\r\n\r\nBut whereas he's argued extensively about the need to eliminate burdens on freedom such as the BSD advertising clause, he's got no qualms about waging a propaganda war to hang the GNU advertising label on everything that uses it.\r\n\r\nIn the end, it's just a juvenile popularity contest. RMS is trying to use all his wiles to promote his 'brand' over the Torvalds 'brand'. Which is just dumb. Free software is just as free, no matter what you call it, and RMS needs to get over his obsession with controlling the language of discourse, and realize that the world is bigger than that. \r\n\r\nPeople speak hundreds of languages on Earth, and thousands of dialects and trade-specific jargons. Making an idea heard outside of a tiny core of like-minded individuals is not an easy thing to do, and you don't get there just by being stubborn. You do it by speaking people's language, and thinking carefully about how to get the uncorrupted message through in that language. Sometime's that's tricky. Sometimes things get lost in translation, and you have to explain something. You have to be open to learning, as well as teaching.\r\n\r\nMaybe I'm just sensitive to this, because in many ways, my entire professional career has stemmed from crossing social lines: race, gender, class, profession, academic discipline, ... whatever -- and making ideas from one side of the line understood on the other. So when people start trying to play the \"Them vs Us\" game, it really pushes my buttons.\r\n\r\nWho's hurt by all this? Is it the real enemy -- the purveyors of DRM and EULAs and 'Trusted Computing'?  No, it's the people who the GNU project really had better be hoping are on their side when the hammers fall. Once upon a time, the GNU project was a shining steel fortress standing for a right idea in a world of wrongs -- but today, it's just one bastion in a great empire of city-states that have sprung up over the plain. And if they don't get over their differences and get their spears pointed in the same direction, they are not going to survive very well.\r\n\r\n"
