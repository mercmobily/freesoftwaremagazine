    body: "<cite>Hilf: When people buy commercial software, really what they’re buying is a guarantee. You’re buying a guarantee that what you have will perform, and has been tested and there’s someone you can call up, and if things go really bad someone’s liable if something doesn’t work. You’re buying this ecosystem of accountability. One of the challenges of open source and really the challenge with the open source business model is: it’s hard to replicate that ecosystem of accountability and that guarantee.</cite>\r\n\r\nNo ulcer for me with that one - it just took me a while to stop laughing. The sad thing is that a lot of people will actually believe this kind of tosh. In fact they will adopt it and repeat it.\r\n<ul><li>Accountability: Since when is Microsoft accountable to anything or anyone except their shareholders? They certainly do not act as if they are accountable to their customers.</li>\r\n<li>Guarantee: of what? Guarantee it will work? Well only for 90 days after date of purchase (not installation mind). And even then if it fails because of a virus which attacks a hole for which say MS have yet to release a patch? Well then you get a guarantee of nothing (talking of Windows XP here)</li>\r\n<li>Liability: See guarantee - the EULA specifically mentions their *limited* liability which is limited to a refund. Not much good if you've lost thousands of dollars worth of documents because they're locked into a product you can't get to work.</li>\r\n<li>Testing: All I can say about their testers is: why would we trust people who having tested it, still left Clippy in MS Office!</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nAnd finally ...\r\n<cite>The two most important ones, Canonical and Red Hat, said “no”. They keep on saying “no”. And they will keep on saying ”no”.</cite>\r\n\r\nThat refusal shows why they are the two most important."
