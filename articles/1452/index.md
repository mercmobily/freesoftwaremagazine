Thereâ€™s a nice, lengthy interview with Richard Stallman at [ZNet](http://www.zmag.org/content/showarticle.cfm?SectionID=13&ItemID=9350). The interview goes into depth on a number of social and political issues surrounding the free software movement. While most of this is well-known to the freedom fighters here at FSM, you might be interested in Stallman's comments about capitalism and identification as an anti-Bush liberal.
