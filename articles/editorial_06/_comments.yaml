    body: "<strong>From</strong>: Karl \r\n<strong>Url</strong>: \r\n<strong>Date</strong>: 2005-07-22\r\n<strong>Subject:</strong> c\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm currently in the middle of a course in Computer Animation in the UK. The course there has a very technical slant, and of course Linux and C programming come up time and again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm sorry to say it, but your story of being put off by a bad teacher is all too familiar to me. Our programming lecturer for the first year was excellent - not only did he teach pretty well but he's also a really nice guy. I took to programming, and genuinely expected it to become my job and livelihood once I'd finished the course. Sadly, our second year programming lecturer was the complete opposite. A complete geek and free software fanatic, he quickly came to epitomise everything we hated about programming. When we found something difficult and asked him a question, he'd always begin his reply with \"But it's sooo eeeasy!!\". His teaching was at best questionable, and many of my class mates were really struggling. He started to refuse to give out answers to his assignments until every single member of the class had completed them. Tensions grew, and it all came to a head a few months ago when one member of the class was having real problems grasping a concept. The lecturer grew more and more frustrated with each question the students asked him, until he eventually exploded \"Just look it up in a book!!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo one took him seriously after that, and attendance at his lectures plummeted. My class started to depend on me more and more for programming knowledge, and I ended up holding my own informal lectures for my class to cover for our lecturer's inadequacies. Whilst I'm pleased to say that many of the people I helped did really well at the end of the year(and some are even looking at persuing programming further), I'm not so lucky. The damage has been done, and I no longer enjoy programming like I used to. I look at the free software community and I see an ideology and a community that I could really have enjoyed just a year ago. Sadly it's too late for that now, and I just have to hope that teachers like this are few and far between."

That's really strange. Because the Free Software Philosophy is all about sharing knowledge and that's what a teacher should do. So this guy did not understand either of them.\r\nBut what Dave wantet to say in his Editorial was, I think, that in many schools there's beeing notthing told about Free Software and sharing knowledge. That's why many great minds get lost  and don't like to program anymore, not only because they had a bad techer. But because they don't like the proprietary software developping world and don't know the Free Software world."
