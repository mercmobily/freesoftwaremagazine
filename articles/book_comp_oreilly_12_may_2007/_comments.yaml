    body: "Every Oreilly published book that I own is a pure gem.  Clear and easy to understanding.  I am very fond of the 'Learning' Titles (Learning Python, Learning Perl, etc.) as well as the 'Nutshell' Ttiles (Linux in a Nutshell, PHP in a Nutshell, etc.).  I will soon be venturing into a few 'Cookbook' Titles and a few 'Programming' Titles as well.  I am looking forward to the writing style and being able to understand what I'm reading 'the first time around'\r\n\r\nOreilly, keep up the excellent work!!"
