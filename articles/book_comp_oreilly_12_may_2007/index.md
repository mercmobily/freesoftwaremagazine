Why do we love O'Reilly so much? It's not just new, quality books like [bash Cookbook](http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/bashckbk/index.html) by Carl Albing, JP Vossen, Cameron Newham (coming out May 24, 2007). It's also the fact that O'Reilly have generously offered to send the _first 10 copies off the press_ of bash Cookbook to 10 of our lucky readers! So not only will ten of our readers recieve a copy of this book, they will recieve the _first_ copies of this book! Go on, get in the running to be the envy of your friends!

Interested? You should be! Here is what you do. If want a chance to get your hands on this book, we want you to log in. That's it? Yes, that's it! During the next week we will be choosing ten subscribers at random who log in between Saturday May 12th, 2007 and Friday May 18th 2007! You must be logged in for more than five minutes to go in the running to win this prize.

During the course of the week we will be emailing ten subscribers at random to tell them they have been selected. You may need to turn off your spam filters. If the subscriber does not respond to our email within 48 hours they will forfeit their prize and an alternative winner will be sought. Please note that we will only send one book per address, and one book per city in any specified state. For our general terms and conditions, see [here](http://www.freesoftwaremagazine.com/terms_and_conditions).

**Remember, you MUST LOG IN to be considered. If you are surfing the site anonymously, you won't be considered!**
