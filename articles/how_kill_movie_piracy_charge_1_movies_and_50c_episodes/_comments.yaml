    body: "Historically, televisions shows have made money through advertising, using ratings to gauge the value of shows/time-slots. I wonder how many people would download 'legal' episodes that include commercials. Estimating the number of downloads of a certain file should be more accurate than previous methods. The transaction costs of millions of 50 cent purchases may become prohibitive. Furthermore, with a download, there is a possibility of the episode being re-watched, possibly doubling (or more) the exposure to the commercials. Rather than charging for the shows, would adding commercials not be a more viable option.\r\n\r\nAs for one dollar movies, perhaps charging a bit more would be acceptable. For a big blockbuster movie to break even under this system the would have to sell ten millions of downloads perhaps extending into the billion dollar range."

    body: "Amazon.Com is sort of following the model that you suggest but charging much more for it.  I'm certainly not willing to pay $80/year plus an additional $3/month just to watch a 30 year old film!   (Look up Romancing the Stone on their site for one such example)\r\n\r\nFor me, the need to own a copy of a movie or TV show is much less important than it used to be as long as I can stream what I want to watch at any time for a reasonable cost.  Several companies here in the U.S. are exploring ways of doing that now.  Better yet, you can do so on several different platforms.\r\n\r\nNetflix (http://www.netflix.com) has a decent sized and growing repository of movies and TV shows available for streaming for just $8 a month.  So far as I can tell, it's roughly 20-30% of their total available library of DVDs.\r\n\r\nThe only major Hollywood studio that is currently releasing first run movies through Netflix is the Starz! consortium, but that's not Netflix's fault.  They're doing the best that they can with the material available.  OTOH, Netflix does have a pretty good selection of older movies and foreign films if you're into that kind of thing.\r\n\r\nThen there's HuluPlus (http://www.hulu.com).  For another $8/month, you can watch first run TV shows (plus a small collection of movies) that most of the major U.S. OTA TV networks own distribution rights for.  The only one that refused to join is CBS, which means that first runs of a handful of good shows like the Big Bang Theory aren't available.  But guess what?  It's available on Neflix one season behind so it's not THAT much of a loss.\r\n\r\nThose two services barely begin to scratch the surface of what's available either cheaply or for free, though.  Crackle (http://www.crackle.com) has a tiny repository of movies (about 300), but it's free.  They use embedded commercials instead of a subscription model.  Then there's stuff like all the major news outlets, specialty channels covering outdoor sports, tech, music, public domain archives of old movies and TV shows, you name it available.  \r\n\r\nBetter yet, there's at least one vendor out there who has figured out how to package all of this stuff in one fairly easy to use interface.  I'm speaking of Roku (http://www.roku.com).  For just $50 (including shipping) you can buy their low end unit, plug it in, and have access to more than 300 online sources playing at 720p.  (The list of sources includes everything that I've mentioned above, btw.)  \r\n\r\nFor just $90 you can get their top end unit which includes full 1080p playback (if the source supports it), an Ethernet jack in addition to the wireless b/g/n NIC, USB port, a microSD slot, and a full version of Angry Birds.  They've got a couple of intermediate models, too, but I don't think they differentiate all that much.\r\n\r\nOne way that Roku has grown their channel list so quickly is that they encourage people to create and publish their own, so-called private channels.  As Roku verifies that those channels work well and don't infringe any copyright holders' rights or Terms of Service of the online providers, they get added to the list that everyone sees.\r\n\r\nTo me, this is a much, MUCH better way to consume movies and TV than renting individually.  Nor do I have a desire to create a huge collection of DVD ISOs any longer.  I can instead just focus my purchases of physical media on the really hard to find stuff that I really like.  In the meantime, I can finally sit down and watch the entire run of Stargate SG:1 for the first time since it first started running.  (Currently at episode 104 out of 213!  :-)  )\r\n\r\nRoku's not the only player in this space.  There's Apple TV, Boxee, and others.  Roku is currently the number one provider for a reason, though.  I think it has the best combination of price, convenience, ease of use, and selection currently available."
