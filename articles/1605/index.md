Do you need another reason today to love GNU? Check out Ed Bott's [Microsoft Pushes the Stupid Button](http://blogs.zdnet.com/Bott/index.php?p=76), which outlines some pretty horrific consequences of the big M's new plot to annoy lamers into ponying up for storebought copies of Windows. The only problem is, the system is as buggy as a Louisiana summer evening in the bayou. The  "Validation Tool" assumes you're guilty until proven innocent, and, what's worse -- Microsoft violated its own user agreement to get this malware installed on its users' systems. This is heavy stuff, and I wouldn't be surprised if we don't hear of a class action soon (assuming there isn't one already).
