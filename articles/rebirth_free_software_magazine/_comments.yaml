It's great that the magazine is free and it will make even greater sense to include news of free software alone. Hotplate should definitely figure there.\r\n\r\nThe only addition I can think of to your list of content is tutorials!"

I'm pretty comfortable using Linux and looking to move to an Intermediate level and beyond!  One suggestion I can make is definitely go ePUB if you can.\r\n\r\nSheridan"
