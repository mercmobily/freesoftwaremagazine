When I started Free Software Magazine, over 10 years ago, it was a very different world. Magazines still mattered, Facebook was a primitive site for university students, Digg was about to become a huge new site (before disappearing a few years later), and... did I mention that Magazines still mattered?

Fast-forward to 2015: it has been 11 years. While I can say that for the first time I have contributed to an exciting free software project with a few thousands lines of code, [Hotplate](http://www.hotplatejs.com/) -- and believe me, [I've been keeping busy](https://github.com/mercmobily/hotplate/commits/master) -- I was forced to put Free Software Magazine in hiatus in order to complete Hotplate.

At this stage, now that I am spending most of my time documenting Hotplate, I feel it's time to reboot Free Software Magazine -- and would like to involve you in the process.

# What should Free Software Magazine be?

So, "What should Free Software Magazine be?" is my question. And it's my question to you, asked in the most humble -- and yet excited -- way. I have some ideas, and would like to hear your honest opinion and suggestions

Please reply to this email, and let me know. I am not sure how many people will respond, but I can assure I will do my best to answer to _everybody_. 

## My idea

I think Free Software Magazine should focus on... free software. That sounds obvious, but it's surprisingly easy to be derailed when trying to decide a route.

In particular:

* Interesting desktop software you might not have heard of 
* HOWTO-style articles on how to achieve something specific (cast to your Chromecast, etc.)
* Comparisons and current status of development tools and libraries
* Legal: Implications of current laws on free software
* Games: great games to play with in GNU/Linux, and news in the GNU/Linux gaming landscape

# Can you help?

At this stage, every kind of input will be most welcome. After about one week of gathering ideas, suggestions and (hopefully) offers to help, I will start rolling out articles from the "new" free software magazine.

Will see you here!
