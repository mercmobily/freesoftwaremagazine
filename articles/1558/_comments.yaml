    body: "The last time I tried Wine, it was really lame and a lot of stuff I tried just didn't work.  But that was a long time ago (maybe 2000 or 2001?).  Since then, I've heard enough to know it has really been evolving. I think I probably should try it again and see if I can get some of my kids' old Windows games running again.\r\n\r\nIt was a real shame when they lost the ability to play them, but it was hard keeping a Windows machine running for them, and I can't understand how people manage with dual-boot systems -- they're so fragile: it's just one too many layers of complexity for me.  Over time, though, it just became less and less important, and my kids got more interested in Linux games, so it's become something of a non-issue.\r\n"
