We all know the advantages of <a href=\"http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html\">Free Software</a>, <a href=\"http://freedomdefined.org/Definition\">Free Content</a>, <a href=\"http://www.earlham.edu/~peters/fos/overview.htm\">Open Access</a> and the like (if you don't, read  ie. <a href=\"http://www.free-culture.org/\">Free Culture</a> and/or <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wealth_of_Networks\">The Wealth of Networks</a>). The striking problem however is how the 'creators' get payed.\r\n\r\nFree Software developpers usually don't get payed by selling software, but by selling support services or programming individual requests. As a writer you get revenue over advertising. As a scientist you get payed by the state. Musicians can make money on live concerts. In all these ways of earning your daily breath you can make your output availlable as Free Content so that everyone can share it with his neigbour over the internet or make changes and improvements to the software, the text, the scientific theory, the music, whatever. \r\n\r\nHowever, the internet is still very young, and we have to find out how it's economics work most effectively. I think a standartised, open, secure micropayment system that would work over the whole 'Net would be a great tool to improve a right revenue stream for free content creators.\r\nHere an interesting article about donating and microdonations: <a href=\"http://www.donationcoder.com/Articles/One/index.html\">When do users donate?</a>"
