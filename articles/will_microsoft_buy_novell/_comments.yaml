    body: "From my calculations Novell lost about 1.8 millions in identity-management but gained 4.7 millions from its Linux business. How come the 91 millions from invoicing into play? If they are what Novell earned through the coupons bought from M$, they are a Linux-related gain. I guess they are; because what else could that huge growth figure (659%) mean.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately there are no figures that would let us calculate how much net loss there is in 'combined revenue from OES and NetWare'.\r\n\r\nWhat really rained on Novell's financial report are the restructuring expenses et.al. that summ up to 23 million US$.\r\n\r\nIt really, really is far-fetched to speculate that Novell's Linux-strategy, including the MS-deal, resulted in a net loss for them. Novell has acquired a couple of really big customers this year, like Peugeot, Credit Suisse and Deutsche Bank, and many organisations consider for the first time using Linux on their desktops, now.\r\n\r\nAlthough Novell still rejects the notion that Linux contains any IP-violations, the reassurance that customers won't face the threat of legal actions seems make the small but decisive difference when it comes to the decision whether or not to use Linux for many."

Why a win win. \r\n\r\nNovell has realized that it can't go head to head with MS, MS simply cannot be outmarketed or outfoxed with the user base it has.  Microsoft has finally relaized that they are no longer a boxed product company but indeed a solutions and support company (at least in the server and corporate desktop realm.\r\n\r\nWhile the \"Open Source\" world indeed has always wanted MS in the crosshairs the simple fact is the business world wants solutions that are secure and productive.

    body: "Patents agreements are common between all companies in the same line of business.Companies realize that they always infringe on someone else's patents. Example, all car manufacturers have patent agreements among themselves. Why? Because there is no way they can manufacture a car without infringing. Do you think an automatic transmission fuel injection, air bags, anti lock brakes, blah blah was not patented by some companies and that the rest just cross license their inventions? Unfortunately in the US we have allowed software patents (the Supreme Court might or might not support strike them down, too early to tell). it means that companies must cross license their patents and they all do, so Novell doing it means nothing about the status of Linux infringing or not. What bothers open source community is that Novell had made a pledge to use THEIR patents against any company that tried to assert their patents against Linux. now with this agreement between Novell and MS, they cannot do that against MS if they decide to get nasty with Linux. That would be HUGE!\r\n\r\nThe author and his friend fail to take really discuss why MS would be interested in buying Novell and with what purpose and the chances of actually being able to do it:\r\n1) What would MS gain? they will gain Novell very valuable patents (if courts allow them to stand) in networking. They will not gain much in the sense that they already have the right to use those patents, but at the same time it would add to their arsenal against Linux\r\n2) Buying Novell means SuSE would be dead, not because MS will discontinue it but because their developers will leave SuSE. Don't forget that SuSE is mostly open source and MS cannot do with that code as they please. Any modification to the original SuSe GPL code will have to be open sourced. \r\n3) Novell has over a billion dollars in the bank, that makes it attractive to many other companies, not just MS.\r\n4) IBM owns part of Novell. they made some strategic investments with Novell when hey purchased SuSE. I am not sure if they own 5% or 15%. in any case IBM is not going to let MS purchase Novell and break that strategic alliance without IBM making it \"painful' monetarily or legally. it would be easier for IBM to buy Novell because it fits them strategically in guaranteeing Linux succeeds. IBM makes a ton of money ($3 billion dollars a year) on Linux related activities and they are not going to let MS ruin  that cash cow.\r\n5) HP makes over $2 billion a year on Linux. i am sure they will not stay on the sidelines allowing MS to destroy another cash cow.\r\n6) Sun/Oracle? They also have an interest in thwarting MS, not because they love Linux, but because they are aware Linux is a big thorn on MS side. Don't forget, \"The enemy of my enemy is my friend\"\r\n7) MS being a convicted monopoly is not free to purchase any company they want. Other competitors will raise hell and go to court if needed to stop it. Can MS afford to be scrutinized again. I bet dinner at Peter Lugar steakhouse in Brooklyn, NY  that they will not want to go through that again.\r\n\r\nI can go on with a zillion other reasons what this article is so dumb, but let it stop here for now"

Have a look at insider's blog MSFTExtrememakeover latest post, which discusses, among many others, changes about MSFT's Linux strategy:\r\nThe phrase \"The Novell SUSE distribution thing is a step in the right direction, but MSFT needs to do more\" is scary. Nonetheless, the post is highly interesting:\r\nsource:\r\nhttp://msftextrememakeover.blogspot.com/2007/03/for-want-of-shoe-or-time-for-new-rider.html\r\n<cite>\r\nThe LBU - Linux Business Unit</cite>\r\n<cite>\r\nYup, time to face the music and stop pretending Linux isn't here to stay. Not only is it, it's likely to eventually gain a significant share of global desktops (read: eventually much more than AAPL). So why is MSFT resisting it so hard versus simply embracing it as yet another opportunity to sell software a la the Mac Business Unit? IMO, MSFT should be focused on what it can still sell accounts who go this route. At a minimum, that could include Servers for legacy support of Windows apps. But maybe MSFT should even develop it's own \"customer-friendly\" linux distro (or, if GPL exposure of that code is an issue, maybe a non-GPL licensed library to run on any distro, or a BSD-based distro)? BTW, if they haven't taken steps to at least determine the engineering feasibility of that and effort required, then they're not doing their job. Additionally, why make it a religious battle? Like any OS, Linux does some things very well. For one, it's much more modular than Windows. So why not empower an internal group to promote it where it might make sense - like say in a set-top box or audio device? The Novell SUSE distribution thing is a step in the right direction, but MSFT needs to do more. Heck, if it can't convince itself that the Windows kernel and architecture is superior - and I can't find a single analysis that argues that's the case (company published or otherwise - if you have one btw, I'd be interested in a link) - maybe it should do an AAPL, hop on board a Mach/BSD kernel, and add value at higher levels only moving forward? </cite>"

How many times have you seen an offensive patent suit from each of the following  companies: IBM, SUN Microsystems, Microsoft, Adobe, Oracle. The ability to exchange patent protections and extend them to customers is a valuable commodity.  It is a sad commentary on the  concept of software patents, but thats another  rant. \r\n\r\nMicrosoft is reaching out to the OSS community.

Everyone seems to think that it's one-sided, with Microsoft getting the upper-hand. I'm not convinced. I think it's quite possible that Microsoft needed to get protection against Novell. I'm sure that Microsoft have seen the SCO source code, possibly long ago. They may even have been using some of it inside Windows. If they discovered that the code had been written by Novell and GPL's they could lose control of their source code, because it would be GPL'd.\r\n\r\nSecondly I think that Microsoft knows that if Linux finally gets accepted as a reasonable desktop alternative then they will have to embrace it (as in embrace and extend.) The obvious thing for them to do would be to fork the kernel and enough of the main packages to create a complete distro pretty much incompatible with everyone else's. Released with a native version of some key Microsoft systems (Exchange, SQL Server) they could do to SuSE what Oracle just tried to do to Red Hat.\r\n"
