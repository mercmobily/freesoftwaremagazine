I also think Gaim's good when using GNOME, but I find it slightly less nice than Kopete. I particularly like how you can set custom names for the contacts in both, which as far as I know you can't do in the official MSN/Windows Live client.\r\n\r\n--\r\nGNU - free as in freedom"

    body: "Good article. My 3 daughters (14, 11, 6) and my wife all use Linux at home as I have removed Microsoft products from the house. We use OpenOffice.org, Konqueror, Thundebird and Firefox running on Slackware 11. My eldest comes home from secondary school (a Windows environment) complaining about the number of crashes the PCs had that day and wishes she had Linux there. My 11 year has hassled the IT guy so much that he has now installed OpenOffice.org and The Gimp (albeit windows versions) as standard programs. I have found by showing my kids the  alternative and stable software available they won't put up with software that doesn't perform. When given a choice, they choose OpenOffice.org and Firefox everytime.\r\n\r\nKids are the future, show THEM what is available, they will set the standards for all software and only that which makes the grade will survive.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    body: "Hi,\r\nI'm a college student from China, and also using Ubuntu. Nice to meet you here who has a chinese wife. ^_^ That's very good you've converted your children to GNU/Linux, although it was caused by a game.\r\n\r\nI'm 22. When I was a child, I remember that the only thing we could play what has some relations to electronics is GBA， and it's even not colorful. When I went to high school, the only OS we had is Win98, I never heard about Linux or Unix before I went to the college. This might be the big difference in China. However, I think we need Linux and free software much urgently than west countries, for our falling behind in IT developing and lack of enough money into research. \r\n\r\nBut that's odd, few people in China knows GNU/Linux, let alone contribute to this great project. I think the main problem caused this is education. People at my age have no much knowledge about it, and as a result we would teach the new generation only Windows, from 9x to NT and now Vista. And our children will teach their children Windows, and so on and so on......\r\n\r\nFinally, I would to say sorry for my English, hope I've made myself clear. Thanks for the great post!"

    body: "\"does not have the bells and whistles such as \"emoticons\" and other gizmos that make it look like someone has vomited on the screen. Personally I think one of the advantages of GAIM is that I am spared from these horrors, but my children have informed me that such paraphernalia is crucial to their generation's ability to share internet experiences with others.\"\r\n\r\nMy experiences on forums (some thing, only asynchronous) with a lot of teens seems to show similar behavior which isn't actually that surprising if you think about your developmental psychology.\r\n\r\nImage is extremely important to teenagers. They're at a stage in life where they are actively trying to define their ego and super-ego (to use psych terms I'm not qualified to use ;-) ), and the image they portray to their friends is an important part of that experience.\r\n\r\nFor them, conversation is just as important as display behavior as it is for actively seeking information. This is why you'll frequently see posts like \"Oh that is SO true!\" (basically NO denotative content), but this post has an avatar, a tagline, a \"location\" (frequently comically fake), and a 500 word signature quoting their favorite song lyrics, anime characters, or whatever. On some sites, it may also have gender, sexual preference, astrological sign, favorite band, favorite anime, or whatever else you'd be frightened to imagine.\r\n\r\nThis is more about establishing presence and making peer bonds than it is about communicating in the technical sense. It's what substitutes online for \"face time\". And just like teenagers spend hours on what decorative T-shirt or earrings to wear and whether their hair should be long or short and which popular accent they should attempt to fake or what slang words are cool, they spend just as much time on these electronic accutrements.\r\n\r\nThey'll grow out of it -- sort of. Most adults still care about the status impression that their car or house makes. Even choosing to \"dress down\" or \"look nerdy\" is often really a signal, used to link to certain peer groups.\r\n\r\nOf course, I went to a high school with uniforms, so some of these behaviors are held in check -- but we still found ways to push the envelope. An online communities I moderate for has a similar set of restrictions -- limits on avatars and signatures, for example. That actually works pretty well at maintaining a sense of balance -- but I'm sure there are a lot of kids who don't find that comfortable and so go elsewhere.\r\n\r\nI think the \"younger generation\" (queue Lawrence Welk) has a lot of fun with these things, and so they do matter. We should definitely not delude ourselves about that: free software needs to provide these kinds of tools as much as serious communications channels, applications, or games. I'm glad to hear that it hasn't been that much of a problem.\r\n\r\nI myself have been treated to the forbidden pleasures of flash animations -- my kids have discovered apparently endless collections of parody animations based on video game characters and the like. The volume of this kind of work that exists is really stunning: I bet amateur flash animators are producing more total animated cartoon output than the entire commercial industry did when *I* was 10.\r\n"
