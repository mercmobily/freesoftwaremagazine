# Poll Results—What’s your distro of choice?

This was a VERY popular poll; lots of comments, lots of votes... the winning distro was Ubuntu, which flew into the lead with 46% of the vote. Then came Debian with 13%, Fedora with 10%, OpenSUSE with 9%, and Gentoo with 6%, then the “other” option with 5%. A lot of people talked about why they liked certain distros, and it helps us too—so we know the kind of things our readers are interested in with regards to their distros.
