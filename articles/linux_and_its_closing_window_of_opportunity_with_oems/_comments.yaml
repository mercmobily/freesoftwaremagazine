It is the way it works with offer following demand.\r\n\r\nThis can be done through showing that Linux is built with freedom in mind, that its users always own the music they might buy on the system, that they will always be able to read their documents in 10 years from now, that they won't ever be tied to a specific harware platform or closed proprietary formats. This last point will particularly be efficient on corporate users, who value total cost of ownership, are risk-averse and flexibility-oriented."

There is only One Microsoft Way and they intend to keep it that way.\r\n\r\nUntil some heretofore unknown OEM becomes the darling of those purchasing Linux pre-installed and claims a significant share of the market, the Dells of the world will only pay Linux lip service.

But are we not right now in a situation, where just like the early days of the internet, in which some people have a general idea what Linux is but most are relatively uneducated as to how one could benefit from using it? What if there is a company that would be willing to take this approach; offer people a free operating system via mail. They possibly could use an advertising approach such as an operating system that is more secure, has the ability to display a 3D desktop, lets you surf the web, burn CDs and DVDs, write documents and spreadsheets that are compatible with windows, and send e-mails and much more all on this one free DVD or CD. It would be a backward approach starting not with the enterprise but the people who make up the enterprise. Thus more enterprises would be more willing to adopt an operating system that isn''t so foreign to their workers. And as more enterprises and home users start using Linux naturally these big corporations would reconsider supporting Linux as it would become more profitable for them to do so. Yes, I realize that AOL has since failed but you know at one point their advertising scheme worked on a lot of Americans. Where are the Linux commercials on television? Why do most people not know that they have an alternative that is free and a lot better than Windows? The answer is no one has seen it on the boob tube or have had it come in the mail so frequently that it has turned into a nice set of coasters.

Everyone and their grandma can run a windows machine, but linux is so different, so weird. Linux is amazing. It has potential. Ubuntu has made it stronger and more user friendly.

As other OSes become more and more expensive (and require more and more expensive hardware), Linux becomes more attractive to those who just need a computer to do the average things (email, browser, some games, photos, music, word processing ...). Not everyone can afford, or needs a bleeding edge system.

And this will only happen if people begin to rebel against the 'trusted computing' and 'DRM' features of MS Vista and OS X.  But people will only understand these draconian limitations after having experienced them first hand.\r\n\r\nI think the computing world will continue to be split into two groups for the foreseeable future - the free (FOSS) computer world and the encumbered (MS, Apple) computer world.

    body: "SuSE Enterprise and OpenSuSE work well on most Lenovo Thinkpad models which are, in my opinion, also the best overall notebook PCs. They are very sturdy, hard to break, have superb keyboards, and displays, and they last forever. I'm using OpenSuSE on an 8-year old Thinkpad with a 300 MHz Pentium II, 384 Megs of RAM, and a 4 Gig slow 4200 rpm hard drive. It takes a while to boot up, but it runs fine once its booted. I've installed various versions of SuSE on dozens of Thinkpads, including current models and it runs well on them.\r\n\r\nLenovo also will sell you a Thinkpad without an operating system, so you don't have to pay the Vindows \"tax\". Last I heard you actually have to call them to order one. You can find references to them on the www.lenovo.com website, but I think you have to call to order one. Tell them that you want to buy the Thinkpad T60 models that are certified for SuSE Enterprise Linux that come without an operating system. OpenSuSE will also work fine on these model Thinkpads.\r\n\r\nAnother great way to buy a Thinkpad is to buy an IBM certified used Thinkpad. These are mostly Thinkpads that IBM has leased to Fortune 500 corporations. They come back from the lease, are checked by IBM technicians for proper operation and are sold for 1/4 of their new price, as little as %300 to $500. Many of them are deluxe T-models with Titanium-coated cases that, when new, sold for 4 times the price. They have a 90-day warranty and I've bought dozens of them for friends, coworkers, and companies I've worked for. Never had a bum one and they make great Linux PCs. I put OpenSuSE on them. The only caviat is that because they are in limited supply and are such great deals, they tend to sell out very rapidly. If you see a model you like, buy it right away, tomorrow they will probably all be sold, although they're always getting in new supplies, so there will always be some available. \r\n\r\nhttp://www-132.ibm.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/CategoryDisplay?storeId=1&catalogId=-840&langId=-1&categoryId=2576396\r\n\r\nThis Lenovo webpage has a link to Novell's website in the lower right hand corner:\r\n\r\nhttp://shop.lenovo.com/SEUILibrary/controller/catalog.workflow:category.details?current-catalog-id=12F0696583E04D86B9B79B0FEC01C087&current-category-id=19C791A03AF24034A0011B825513BCED\r\n\r\nHere is Novell's webpage with references to the SuSE certified Thinkpad T60s:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.novell.com/partnerguide/product/204602.html\r\n\r\nThe Thinkpads that come with Windows will generally work well with SuSE Enterprise or OpenSuSE, but you will be getting a copy of Vindows that you will be throwing away.\r\n\r\nCheck out the excellent Linux on Laptops webpages for reports by Thinkpad owners on distros that worked for them on specific Thinkpad models:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.linux-on-laptops.com/ibm.html\r\n\r\nNo matter whether you buy a new or a certified used Thinkpad, tell the order taker on the phone or put in a comment in the online form telling them that you are going to be putting Linux on your Thinkpad and would like them to sell them with Linux installed. They will log these sorts of comments and if they get enough interest, they will respond to it."

Easy enough to link the two and jump in with a fair bit of market share, right? Wrong.\r\n\r\nWhy? Simply because Microsoft arm-twisted EVERY hardware device vendor - printer manufacturers, sound card manufacturers, you name it. Result? ALL drivers had to be written by IBM. Not a single hardware vendor chipped in. O well, a few did. But they were niche manufacturers and didn't matter. Not one mainstream hardware vendor wrote a single OS/2 driver.\r\n\r\nResult? OS/2 didn't have good hardware support. Sound familiar?\r\n\r\nSo here is the truth. GNU/Linux has only got where it is because of a huge, invisible movement. IT people are pushing Linux by investing the time to install, configure and support these installations on their own machines, as well as their colleagues machines. GNU/Linux took over the server room because of administrators disgruntled with Microsofts heavy-handedness.\r\n\r\nGNU/Linux has taken over the developer workstation because of developers disgruntled with Microsoft's heavy-handedness.\r\n\r\nGNU/Linux has taken over the graphical workstation because of graphics workers disgruntled with single vendor lock-in.\r\n\r\nDo you see a common thread here? I do. It is vendor-lock-in, awareness of a monopoly hurting creativity and innovation, and becoming unhappy with Microsoft dictating hardware and software upgrade cycles that is pushing people to move to GNU/Linux from the bottom, up.\r\n\r\nSo what you say will never happen. No OEM (except niche OEMs or mainstream OEMs on niche products) will pre-install GNU/Linux on their products. No OEM will supply drivers for GNU/Linux. They may make it a little easy by collaborating and sharing specifications, or writing to open standards.\r\n\r\nWhat you say can only ever happen when the monopoly that Microsoft has is broken down completely. And that can only happen after a long time. Moving from the bottom, up has been hard and painful. But many have done it. Many continue to do it. And for every one who move over to GNU/Linux, there are at least five more who are positively affected by the move and they begin trying a dual boot configuration. Every one who has made the shift is only to happy to help friends and family shift.\r\n\r\nThat is where we must concentrate. Helping people around us make the move. That's the only way GNU/Linux will become mainstream."

This means that I can't look at or browse how they work before I buy. \r\n\r\nDon't get me wrong. When I do purchase my next computer, I will definitely order a computer with Linux pre-installed, however, this will happen in a few years. Until then, I would love to go to my local shop and play with the laptop until it's time to make the purchase. This in itself, will make me more excited and eager to buy, maybe I'll buy early.. but not with the status quo.\r\n\r\nWhat we need is someone to open a shop that doesn't sell windows computer, but only Linux computers alongside other gadgets. This way, M$ won't be able to up their OEM licenses and screw me over, and the Linux community will definitely make all their purchases (gadgets as well) from this shop. Put it someone accessible, central London for instance and you're off.\r\n\r\nI reckon there is a large enough community of people who would shop from there to make it profitable, all is needed is startup capital.

    body: "Too many distro;s.... Well, I am not so sure. Be aware of what you are comparing. Saying that MS only has one distro is a bit far-fetched in my view. I consider a distro to be a bundle of software consisting of the base-OS, necessary drivers and a few more or less useful programs put together by a distributor. MS has one base-operating system, which in itself does not really include much. Drivers and other software are up to third-party manufacturers to produce and contribute. These distributors (manufacturers or other OEM's) collect all these necessary items for you, streamline the installation process, create an image, and with a bit of luck you even get a recovery-cd... In this way you actually talk about Dell-, HP-, IBM-, Gateway-, and Acer-\"distro's\", just to name a few. A fresh OS-only installation from retail windows-cd's will probably not work very well on hardware from these manufacturers either. Not to mention using the distribution-specific install media on a system from another vendor. Ever tried to install from a Dell recovery-cd to an HP-system or vice versa? Did it work?  \r\n*Any* manufacturer or OEM can easily do this to a linux system as well. If they want to. Or if the hardware-manufacturer wants to. Not enough drivers is really not a \"linux\"-problem, but a manufacturer-problem. If the manufacturers release the specs or produce the drivers themselves, everything works on linux as easy as on windows.\r\n"

    body: "The biggest problem in working with OEMs is their product schedule.  Every three to six months they put out a completely new line of machines, incorporating the latest chipsets.  By the time a Linux vendor obtains this machine and gets the new drivers working in the mainline kernel the product is already nearly obsolete from the OEM's standpoint.  Sure, it will serve a user's needs for another year, but by the time Linux is fully supported on a brand new system it is too late for the OEM to push it into the sales pipeline.\r\n\r\nThe only answer to this is to work with the chipset designers.  But even the ones that actually produce Linux drivers do not usually work directly with the core kernel developers, and they don't have the skills to produce code that meets all the standards and can be directly integrated into the latest kernels.  Generally, you get a mess of code that modifies some other driver to handle this new device, probably disabling other similar devices.  It is generally a tarball of code which might compile against some not quilt current version of the kernel, rather than a patch.  All this means even more time slipping by before a working Linux distribution for a now not-quilt-so-new laptop can be shipped.\r\n\r\nAll this applies less to the top tier hardware producers like Intel which often have core kenrel developers on staff.  It applies more to the ones producing the tiny, inexpensive components like USB keys, modem chipsets, low end graphics chips to be shipped on low end machines, and they companies that grab handfuls of these components and make them into inexpensive notebook computers.  These companies that make $10 per machine if they are lucky, and they are the ones that stand to gain most if they don't have to buy a Windows license for every machine they sell.\r\n\r\n-dsf"

He will spend hours to send you letters to confirm that he will only take the whole PC back, and give you your money back (even 6 month after initial purchase, because sending letters back and forth takes time...).\r\n\r\nSo the question is: why would HP (for instance) spend so many yours with legal teams, and buy back an outdated PC, instead of writing a 100$ check?\r\n\r\nWhy?\r\nProbably because Microsoft demands that the OS price never appears, and that ALL PCs are sold with Windows. \r\nWhat if it is not the case?\r\nWell, when \"HP recommands Windows\" shows on you screen, you may be sure that Microsoft pays for this. And the amount of this ad depends purely on MS good will... In this low-margin world, I suspect no hardware vendor would fight against Microsoft, they have too much to loose.\r\n\r\nAccording to me, Microsoft pressure is such that they prevent OEM vendors to sell Linux-PCs by all ways (except some outdated expensive PCs that nobody will purchase, in order to \"prove\" that there is no end-user need...)\r\n"

    body: "The problem with free software is that most of it is written to scratch a particular itch. Sometimes that same itch if common to several developers, some may coopoerate, some may decide on different ways of curing said itch (they may get a rash if they scratch) and some may not even notice someone else is scratching the same itch they got.\r\n\r\nUnder Windows, you just don't scratch an itch: you may need a new skin graft to repair the scratch, so it's too scary: you live with the itch, and you get used to it, and the next, and the next...\r\n\r\nThing is, nowadays most people think about a computer as being an oversized and somewhat smart toaster: they think it should Just Work (tm) when they set the dial and push the button. If it doesn't, you overhaul it/throw it away.\r\nThe Linux users and makers, 'unfortunately', are more of the 'fix the toaster's spring tension' kind, or more into the 'hand-painted toaster job' that got dissatisfied with Windows' 'you can only put approved magnets on it' policy.\r\n\r\nSuffice to say, most toaster makers don't cover self-repair jobs and home-made paint jobs. Those who do will sell you more expensive yet sturdier toasters.\r\n---\r\nA computer is like air conditioning: it becomes useless when you open windows."

    body: "I have had a number of PC's since 1990. During this time I have had to struggle less and less as I have installed Linux. I started with Slackware 3.4 and then Red Hat ( 5.2 I think ). I soon decided that I would check that a printer, video card etc would work before I bought it.\r\nI would tell the salesman that this was why I had bought it and insist that they would refund my money if it didn't actually work ( which might be because the manufacturer had changed the chipset ). I then started to email manufacturers >>> both the one who's product I bought AND the ones who I didn't buy from.\r\n\r\nThis way all knew that their product might be used with something other than MS O/S's.\r\nFor example an epson printer ( C62 I think ) did work\r\nI saw little support from canon, lexmark so they got to know why I didn't buy theirs.\r\nI realize things are changing but if we all do that it will show them just how many of us there are.\r\nAt present I don't see how they will get that information.\r\nI believe this is one way each one of us can contribute."

    body: "Here is a simple problem that I'll build my idea on: \r\nI personally like the num lock key to be switched on by default once I’ve logged in to KDE.\r\nHow do I change that setting? (Answer is here: http://www.fsdaily.com/EndUser/KDE_Tip_Switch_NumLock_On_at_Startup )\r\n\r\nSo how does a user having this simple problem express it in order to find help?\r\n * He calls for a more knowledgeable guy (not available always, perhaps never)\r\n * He searches the net (frustrated by not receiving relevant results)\r\n * Posts it on a forum (someone may answer, after a while).\r\n\r\nThe problem has been solved before, it is easy to solve, but it's hard to express it in a way that brings relevant results. \r\n\r\nWe need to stop our tech support volunteers from reinventing the wheel every time such a simple question is put! Such questions are put more often than we like and piss off everyone who's more experienced with this new ecosystem. They generate the RTFM reaction from our geeks. Automate this, make it as smooth as possible. Should someone be able to deal with this simple problems, it will be a lot easier to deal with the more difficult ones.\r\n\r\nLots of end users have this kind of simple problems (actually simpler!).\r\nCurrently Ubuntu Forums (I picked it because I use it daily) has less than 600.000 users generating a little over 5.000.000 posts (in the whole existence of the site!).\r\nThe estimated number of internet-connected computers is around 600.000.000. Hopefully that translates in 1computer:1user, but I think the rate is actually 1 computer:more users. \r\n\r\nSo say that 10% of those internet connected PC have Ubuntu installed - that makes 60.000.000.\r\nEach of the users of those computers do have different small problems. Can you imagine half of those users posting their problems on the forums? Imagine the frustration on each side, one being end users who just want to use their PCs, the other tech support volunteers running the forum. I think it's a nightmare! Yes, \"Check if already posted\" button has made wonders - but it's not enough. It doesn't do semantics, it doesn't suggest alternative ways of expressing an idea. Searching for the problem in the chosen example in the forums yields no results. Think that nobody has had this problem? No, I think lots of people do have it, but don't ask it. They don't get answers and come to the conclusion that Linux is unsupported.\r\n \r\nMy solution:\r\nWe need a tech support search engine - a distributed techbase - a Google for TechSupport if I may. Maybe semantic web will help, who knows? What would you say about having a <techbaseQuest tags='NumLock, default, KDE' difficulty='easy'> How do I turn NumLock on by default? </techbaseQuest> and several <techSolution votes='9' useful='8.3'>Click here and here. <screenshot/> Press this button</techSolution>\r\n\r\nWhat are your ideas? Could this keep the Linux window of oportunity as open as possible?"
