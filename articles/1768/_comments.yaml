    body: "Over the last few months, the school I work at has been struggling with a company that produces a *proprietary* software program.\r\n\r\nAbout 2 years ago the company that we now deal with bought out the software company that produced our Student Information System - support went downhill fast.  Then at the beginning of this year this company also bought out a program from Apple Computers - Now they are requiring all of their customers to transfer to this new program. I immediately opened a complaint to the FTC (as if that would help anyway). They are killing off the program that we use, no support, no updates, no source code!\r\n\r\nThis upset just about everyone in the school, but no one understood why I was so \"grumpy\" about it (I even re-read Free Software, Free Society) - I knew that this was unethical and was a gross misuse of copyright - now I can send everyone a link to explain to them why.\r\n\r\nThanks for putting it into easy to understand concepts."

    body: "I can't believe you actually said that! ;-)\r\n\r\nBTW, you describe in phrase the \"American\" idea of 'a pre-written contract between the public at large and an individual.'  That's pretty much the meaning of the expression \"social contract\". Is that actually an American idea? We certainly took to it with enthusiasmâ€”in fact, it is the terms of a \"breach\" of \"social contract\" that the US Declaration of Independence used to justify the revolution against English rule. So we kind of <em>have</em> to believe in it.\r\n"

    body: "I only meant the idea of copyright being expressed as a kind social contract, in reference to U.S. style copyrights, given that some nations do formulate copyright based on different principles.  I did not mean to imply the concept is either originally or uniquely American, however.\r\n\r\nAs to sociopathic companies, I applied the definition \"...these people are at least temporarily very successful in society. They achieve their success by socially unacceptable means and at the expense of the community and its citizens...\"  Seemed very applicable.  Maybe I should add a [8] :).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    body: "With the advent of desktop-oriented distributions like Ubuntu, SuSE, and Linspire (there are others, I know), why anybody would subject themselves like a Microsoft or Apple EULA is beyond me.  I have been using exclusively GNU/Linux in a dyed-in-the-wool, and fairly large, \"Microsoft shop\" for over three years now.  At home, I formatted my last Windows 98 box four years ago.  Thus, I personally have been \"Windows Free Since 2003\", and I don't worry about EULA's anymore.\r\n\r\nNo, I do not use Microsoft Office; OpenOffice.org is a wonderful suite and actually supports ISO standards, not to mention Microsoft's ridiculously proprietary file formats.  Evolution allows me to connect to the MS Exchange Server at work (sadly, I don't control email there).  Can I play Windows games?  No.  Do I want to?  Nope, I've got an actual life to live and a girlfriend to kiss.  :-)\r\n\r\nMy computing life without Microsoft Windows--or Mac OS--has been a relief and a joy, and I encourage everyone to do so."

Copyright laws in America differ from other countries, will this affect the user when used in other countries? Better to use Linux so as not to be snared in this web of confusion!'

Some programs I have bought have a system that doesn't allow one to make copies of the support the software comes on. Maybe we should implement this on downloadable software as well. \r\n--- \r\nMary-Anne Davis"
