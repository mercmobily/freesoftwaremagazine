Everything from mega-smartphones (my term for \"desktop killers\") to apps that run entirely on the web (like Google Apps) are supposedly making the desktop and laptop obsolete.\r\n\r\nPeople who say that overlook some things, IMHO. \r\n\r\nI spent most of Memorial Day weekend at my in-laws' house. I had my laptop, and my cell phone with me (yes, it is still a cell phone, not a smartphone, although this one does have a built-in camera, I don't use the camera for anything other than changing the picture on the phone screen). My in-laws live deep in the woods and hills out in the middle of nowhere. Cell phones don't get a signal out there, or at the very least, are unreliable. They don't have a computer, but even if they did, they live far enough out that they probably can't get broadband internet. Cable isn't offered in there area (although they can pick up TV signals from two different cities... three when the weather conditions are good).\r\n\r\nThe point is, my laptop was completely cut off from the outside world for that weekend. But other than losing the Internet connection, I didn't lose any capability. I could (and did) write a couple of letters and other documents using OpenOffice.org Writer, crunched some numbers on a personal spreadsheet using OpenOffice.org Calc, I played some of my favorite games, I processed some photos my wife and I took over the weekend using GIMP, and I burnt a couple of FOSS CDs. I even did some searches for old emails from my POP3 account which were stored on my computer, even though I couldn't access new emails.\r\n\r\nIn short, I had no trouble doing my \"work\" on my laptop. If I relied totally on Internet apps, I would have been out of luck. And while mega-smartphones aren't totally reliant on the Internet for applications, the Internet does play a heavy part in their capabilities. \r\n\r\nSo until a mega-smartphone can do most of the work of a desktop without having Internet access, I don't think laptops and desktops have anything to worry about."

Easy, because you cannot realistically display large scale network drawings on a small screen no matter how good the resolution.

    body: 'What you''re saying is definitely true for a lot of people, particularly for ''casual'' users who just go in for games, surfing and email.  What''s important though, is not which device a particular person favours, be it desktop, laptop, console, handheld, thin google client or chip-in-the-brain (they all have their applications and I personally don''t believe there is such a thing as ''dead'' technology, someone, somewhere will always find a use for it); the main issue is how these devices will interoperate with each other.  With manufacturers churning out different devices, each with their own slightly differing methods of talking to other devices you end up with the kind of problems we currently see on the desktop; and the success of any particular device will ultimately depend on its ability to successfully communicate with other devices cleanly and without problems; beaming data from my phone to my LCD (or surround sound system, or TV, or coffee-maker) is great, but only if it works everywhere and not just with a subset of devices made by the same company or by a partner of the company.  The Linux kernel is the undisputed king of interoperability, it works and works well on more hardware than any other operating environment, free or otherwise; it can and has been adapted for everything from TVs through consoles to washing machines but the issue remains that none of these systems can really talk to each other except in the most basic and specific of ways (copying photos, sending emails etc).  Yes I want the ability to dynamically switch between my phone display and TV and I want it to be effortless (and resolution independent :), but I also want the rack of processors in my back cupboard to share the load if I''m doing a lot of intensive work on my phone (or desktop, or laptop).  I want my oven to tell my phone (or my TV, whatever I happen to be looking at) it''s finished cooking my dinner or my entryphone to reroute to my mobile if I''ve had to pop out for a few minutes, and I want full and easy control over the whole process.  So many appliances now have processors in them, and so many of them run Linux, but none of them really talk to each other.  In my opinion the Linux community really has to capitalise on its interoperability advantage and design a good solid protocol so that all these upcoming (and current) devices can work together, and ensuring that the centre of our computing world is based upon non-proprietary standards that can work for free for any device, and compelling enough that even proprietary device manufacturers will gain value from implementing it.  Then we''ll start seeing the really cool stuff.'

For my job in the engineering branch this solution would be by far to unreliable besides the fact that no mobile hardware can live-up to the hardware I have to use in my job and will never do in the forseeable future ( it always comes down to power consumption and waste heat ) . The thing that big screens and keyboards are never going to disappear ( maybe they'll be replaced with some equivalent useful technologies ) is out of question. Moreover it's a proven fact that mobile devices have a much shorter lifetime, lesser resistance to mechanical stress and get stolen by far more often. Those arguements may seem ridiculous to you but for the company I'm working for those are the reasons why they stopped experimenting with different mobile solutions and stayed with a combination of desktop and laptop ( that's usually used as a stationary pc at home by most of the employees :) ).\r\nReliability and security.

    body: "<em> It will start in 3 or 4 years: there will be a technology to send the signal from your phone to an LCD screen. (This is, in my opinion, the real missing piece in the puzzle.)</em>\r\n\r\nThat I totally agree with. The PDA screen (I use PDA in this, meaning PDA, smart phones, etc.) is almost useless to write anything other than simple text messages, and to read long passages is difficult at best. You got to have a nice screen, and a normal sized keyboard (at least the qwerty keys) to type.\r\n\r\nFor PDAs to even be considered to replace laptops, not to mention desktop, requires several things. \r\n\r\n#1: Laptops have been said to be the desktop killer. But it hasn't happen for one major reason; open architecture. Want a new video card? Open the case and plug it in. Doing that is almost impossible with a laptop. \r\n\r\nGoing into a PDA, your even MORE limited. Want a new OS? That may be nigh impossible. Add a new program? Has to be specially made for PDAs limits, which limits you even more to the amount of software. \r\n\r\n#2: Phone companies want you to subscribe/pay for every little thing. I've thought before it'd be nice to have at least cell phone internet to get e-mails while on the road. Uh uh. The cost would be prohibitive. Last I checked, it was like $30 a month for 28.8kbps. Then your also paying for every byte you download too. It could easily run into $100s a month. \r\n\r\n#3: The biggest thing. DRM. This is another thing that's blowing the foot off music players. Well known fact that even Itunes/Ipod is having problems because people are sick and tired of being told what they can do with devices they buy. I refuse to buy an Ipod because of DRM. I refuse to buy anything though Itunes because of DRM. \r\n\r\nI will not buy a book reader (like Sony's) because of DRM\r\n\r\nThe main thing is; if you want people to buy your devices, stop restricting what they can do with it. Desktops and laptops aren't restricted.\r\n\r\n#4: Proprietary architecture. If you want a particular PDA, you have to buy (for example) Cingular. Go to a different area, you'll need a Sprint phone. \r\n\r\n#5: My main gripe. Hardwired batteries. I've ranted about this before, and it's still a burr in my shorts. I wont' buy a brand new device in 6 months to a year because the batteries died. If you need LION batteries, then allow them to be replaced like regular AA type batteries. Laptops have such, why can't PDAs? \r\n\r\nThe bottom line: Cost, and restrictions. Solve those two problems, then you MIGHT replace the laptop. Until then, I'll keep my trusty T22 Thinkpad.\r\n\r\n- Kc"

The printer is wireless, the keyboard and mouse on the desktop are wireless, the only wired network in the house is for the crusty last-gen console game systems, and if I need to sit down for some serious typing, it only takes a second to hook up a keyboard to my laptop. If I really wanted to, it would only take a few minutes (and less time after the first) to hook the output up to the living room television. The idea that the same could be done with a smaller device is not in the least bit outrageous or unrealistic, it's simply a matter of time.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the bigger systems will still have their places, but not on administrative and editorial desks, rather they will be on the desks of developers and tucked into people's closets or sitting where their DVD players do now. When everyone's using their own computer it should be a relatively short time before they realize they need a good solution for their data to be backed up, and also have a central place to share data with one another (not to mention performing the functions of the DVR and storing the household movie and music collections)."

Certainly, PCs will evolve along with everything, and my cellphone may some day hook as easily into my PC, my TV, my WiFi network as my DVD player, my digital camera, or my camcorders do. Well, in fact, it does, but I don't have much use to dock the RAZR today. \r\n\r\nThe problem with every Phone++ idea is that, while they add cool PDA, PC, or MP3 player capabilities, they wind up being crappy phones. Back in the days of the fixed-function phone, I had a tiny flipphone that fit in my pocket, and I got a week+ on a battery. Today, the RAZR does a few additional things, it fits my pocket, and the battery lasts two days.. assuming I just use it as a phone. If it's my MP3 player, it'll be common for me to miss calls because the battery died. \r\n\r\nMost PDA/cellphones, while not as large as a PDA and a cellphone duct-taped together, aren't far from it, and may well drop capabilities along the way. If the PDA/Phone doesn't fit my pocket, to me it's not a useful phone, because I'll be leaving it home, just as a left my PDA home back when I used it (I have a Sharp Zaurus, running Linux, but battery life is so bad as make the whole thing pointless... it's collecting dust on a shelf here... and it's too large for the pocket, anyway). \r\n\r\nAnd of course, every cellphone has to run from batteries, or maybe fuel cells some day, but it's inherently a low power device. The cellphone ten years from now might achieve the kind of CPU power my PC has today, but it's never enough, at least in some field (video, CAD, etc)... my PC of the future will still be 250x faster.  Same with display... having a 320x400 pocket display is pointless for virtually everything I do on my PC, it's even painful reading email. I have dual 1600x1200 monitors on my PC, and will certainly upgrade to something HDish (both) once the prices drop a little. The useful work I do is marginal with 100MB storage... I have 2TB on my home computer. So something very revolutionary has to occur in storage to make it pocketable... and I'm not talking hard drives here, since that'll kill your battey life. Probably something like MRAM, and tons of the stuff. \r\n\r\nUntil then, sure, there are some web-based things people do that may play on small screens. Some today maybe real, most are likely just Gee-Whiz, ain't this cool stuff. Anyone using an Web application is not really PC-dependent today... they could do that same thing on a smart terminal or the Nokia pad or anything else that can run a Web browser... so moving them to a different web browser isn't really displacing the PC in the way being suggested, unless you someone imagine everyone's going to give up the security of fast, local computing and storage for something remote and slow. When I can edit my 50GB video files over a wireless internet connection as fast as I can locally, independent of any activity-based slowdowns (eg, all the problems the net has today), let me know.\r\n\r\nAnd there's big resistance to change for change's sake, or even for good reasons. If you're just using the Web, maybe that Nokia tablet is a good idea... but who's using it. Much of corporate America today could dramatically reduce office costs going to cheaper PCs running Linux and, in fact, run functionally more reliable systems as well... but what little of this has happened is slow, piecemeal stuff. The fact of not needing a Windows PC today doesn't automatically make people change to something else... they need a dangling carrot, something that makes that \"something else\" better. \r\n\r\nOnce you solve the battery power issue, the having to run trailing edge CPU power, the display problem (4K virtual display in my eyeglasses.. sure, I'll have that), the storage problem, etc.; once you have something actually useful that fits in the pocket and replaces the PC, you'll discover that thing in your pocket IS the PC. Here's the simple reason: making a PC into a cellphone is a simple matter of adding a simple baseband chip and some software -- PCs are starting to get this already, with built-in EVDO modems (that's what Verizon uses for their VCAST sevice). You can't begin to add a $10 part to a cellphone to make it replace you PC. So while the PC may mutate, and you may in the far distant future carry it in your pocket and make cellular (or, more likely, cellular VoIP calls over something like Skype.... once it's a PC in your pocket, it's all just data)"

The only thing limiting it from being as useful as a laptop is the limited program selection and memory.\r\n\r\nA more valid critique would be in regards to the fact that you need a larger box to house faster and hotter processors, as well as more ram, hard drives, tv cards, etc etc etc.  Your general average person that doesn't do anything with a computer other than treat it like a typewriter that does email and web may not care, but there are very many who do processor intensive activities that will always require more computing power.  Such as graphics people and people who like 3d games for a short list.   There will always be something more that can be done with a faster computer that many many many people will want to do.  The 20% to 30% of computer users that do strictly text and similar activities may very well abandon a larger faster system for what is being suggested by palm...   but I question that too.\r\n\r\nIt will be only a matter of time before someone makes an application that syncs with a smart phone and a desktop/laptop in a similar way.

In most instances, you cannot replace the component. When this component goes bad, you have to basically trash your laptop/phone and buy a new one. Buying new computers/phones is expensive.\r\n\r\n-2 \r\nHard drives provide cheaper memory than what cell phones use. Users have lots of files and documents that will not fit onto the phone memory. Furthermore, the phone is more proned to get lost or take damage than a desktop computer. Its not practical to store important things on your phone. Think about this: How many times have you misplaced your wallet or keys? \"Oh shit, I lost my computer\"\r\n\r\nThere are more but I think these alone are enough.\r\n"

Let me expand on what Tony is suggesting. \r\n\r\nThere will still be desktops but not as they are today - stand alone machines. Instead, they will become simply docking stations for portable devices which everyone will have. Basically, these portable devices will be very powerful (by today's standards) PDA/phones.\r\n\r\nThe portable devices will be carried around by people and will be used independently - mini PCs in their own right. But when mobility is not required - at home or at work - they can be docked, probably wirelessly, into these desktop docking stations and can be used to drive them.\r\n\r\nThese docking stations would consist of a monitor, keyboard and mouse (or whatever I/O devices we are using by then) and would probably have additional hardware like more RAM, processors, better sound and graphics cards etc. The portable device would hold all of your personal/private info and preferences and the OS. It would control all of this extra hardware, once docked, gaining additional processing power, memory, etc. \r\n\r\nPeople complaining about only having dial-up connections and poor reception or none at all will be moved out of the stone age by the time all of this happens. \r\n\r\nThis all sounds like it would work with the plan another author, Matthew Roley, has <a href=\"http://www.freesoftwaremagazine.com/articles/a_revolutionary_idea_for_tomorrow_s_pcs\">here</a> at FSM. The PDA/Phone would be just another hot-swappable component of his \"distributed desktop\".\r\n\r\nOf course, we are only theorising from our current paradigm.

In fact, a mobile or PDA could serve as the 'kernel box' that I describe in the article, this would be intuitive and actually add more to the system in that the mobile could serve as a 'univeral remote' for the other devices.  But it should not be a requirement, what the replies to this article clearly show is that (unsurprisingly) different people have different uses for technology and have preferred ways of working with said technology.\r\n\r\nMy main point is that there will always be different ways of doing things, desktop, smartphones, consoles etc., with more and more ways appearing as technology evolves. Rather than focusing on how a particular component would work (and hence disregarding all those who don't (or can't) use that component, I feel it is essential to focus on the interoperability between devices; it won't then matter what the user prefers as their computing weapon of choice because it should work transparently with other devices.  What I hope everyone can agree on is that whatever technology you're using it needs to be able to talk to other technology (literally in the case of mobiles).  No-one can predict what devices will emerge in future but we DO know that they will need to talk to other devices, so why don't we nail down a protocol for doing this; then when those new devices do emerge they will just work with everything else, rather than us having to go through the whole hassle of *getting* them to work with everything else, which is pretty much what we're forced to do now everytime a new gadget comes around, be it a TV, phone or console.  Backward compatibility is a big issue that has hounded all systems for *decades* now, I really think it's time we started thinking more about forward compatibility.\r\n\r\n"

If I make changes to my PDA or my phone, those need to be \"hotsynced\" back to my desktop.\r\n\r\nI was tired of my old, free cellphone, and dived in to the PDA phone concept.  I bought a XV6700 (aka HTC Apache or PPC6700) back in October.  It's served well as a cellphone, but it also does a good job at syncing my contacts.  For calendar events, I found an application that will sync my events between my phone and Google Calendar.  It's pretty slick.  I don't mind the idea of the hotsync, but the availability of hotsyncing someplace and having the data available for multiple devices goes a long way towards the elimination of the \"desktop\".  Another nice feature that I have on my PDA phone is a mobile web interface to <a href=\"http://www.mp3tunes.com>mp3tunes.com</a>, which is a free, online storage for my MP3 and OGG files.  I can play them back over the Internet on my phone.  I can also listen to them via my Motorola bluetooth stereo headphones with a slightly degraded quality, or via any normal pair of stereo headphones.\r\n\r\nWhat would really help for Tony's concept to take off?  I think massive coverage, wireless Internet coverage would do the trick.  The cell phone companies have that cornered right now, and charge pretty high rates for access (my XV6700 cost $45/mo for \"unlimited\" data access).  Wifi 802.11b/g will be around a while, but the inclusion of WiMax or some other longer-distance wireless service would be key.

    body: "I continue to use desktop computers for 3 reasons:\r\n\r\n1) Interoperability of components. Because of the large form-factor and relative simplicity of hard-wired buses, it is easier to assemble a desktop out of separate components from separate manufacturers. I almost never buy a computer as a single purchase. This requirement of flexibility and pluggability of components is also one of several good reasons why I use free software. I have a much finer degree of personal choice when I use both desktop systems and free software applications.\r\n\r\n2) Ergonomics. The size of keyboard and position of your hands becomes important over time. When you're young, you can handle uncomfortable positions even when typing, but you pay for it later. Since I'm starting into the \"paying for it\" stage, I'm even more concerned about it now. Laptops can be okay, but they'll never be as comfortable for long duration sessions.\r\n\r\n3) Price. Desktops are still cheap. Especially when you buy them the way I do, which is in pieces, often of slightly-out-of-date used equipment when it is being liquidated. My last computer purchased cost about $150. $500 is more typical for me. I go through CPUs and cases faster than monitors (which tend to be the limiting factor in cost for me) and keyboards -- so I often get away with paying only for the CPU, motherboard, and peripherals as separate, small expenses. This monitor has been used on at least 3 different computers and is at least 6 yrs old. I like LCDs because they don't get fuzzy when they get old like CRTs do (they also aren't as environmentally hazardous to dispose of when they do fail).\r\n\r\nOf course, there is a higher price paid in effort when you do things this way -- lots of stuff doesn't integrate well, and sometimes installation is a real pain. On the other hand, with a desktop, if you don't like one of the expansion cards, you have the option to just buy one that works instead of spending (as I once did) 2 weeks trying to get the sound to work on a laptop (I was stubbornly trying to get ALSA 0.5 running on an HP ThinkPad running Debian -- it did finally work though).\r\n\r\nI'm still interested in getting a laptop or a PDA, though, because it is a real lack when travelling (I was really at a disadvantage when covering PyCon 2007 because of this -- I was the only person I noticed taking notes on -- horrors! -- <em>paper</em>). I've been contemplating the difficulties of installing Debian on that $500 laptop that Walmart has been selling lately.\r\n\r\nStill, I don't travel that much. So the anchoring effect of using a desktop just isn't that much of a hassle for me.\r\n\r\nIn any case, though, I don't think the PDA or laptop will be replacing my desktop system. When I upgrade, it'll be to another desktop.\r\n"

Electronic books are still a pain in the ass...and speaking of asses...I can enjoy a book in the ...ahem....\"reading room\".\r\n\r\nI do see the role of the desktop PC and notebook declining...but for certain types of applications users will still need the computing power of these devices for quite some time."

    body: "I think I can wait for both this \"revolution\" and the overly complicated mobile devices that are supposed to drive it.\r\n\r\nAfter all, it would be nice to get one that you can set up and use with relative ease without having to read a huge manual or search for days on Google for information.\r\n\r\nSay what you will about them, at the moment these things are more hype than practical and are, I submit, likely to stay that way.\r\n\r\nWhile these \"Death of\" articles are interesting, as others have pointed out the so called \"futurists\" get it wrong close to 100% of the time and are likely be now.\r\n\r\nBefore we get carried away with the possibilities let's pause to consider a couple of things.\r\n\r\nOne of the increasing health and safety issues in the work place is the crackberry..oops..blackberry and it's ilk.  It demands attention to the extent that people actually do suffer asymptomaic withdrawl when they don't work, batteries die and so on.  I've personally had to send two twenty-somethings home because they were a danger to me, themselves and others because their phone/PDA wasn't working for some reason and they were stressed so much that they were unfit for work.  Not to mention in one case not having slept of 72 hours.  Extreme case to be sure but very real.\r\n\r\nFinally:\r\n\"People complaining about only having dial-up connections and poor reception or none at all will be moved out of the stone age by the time all of this happens.\"\r\n\r\nNo they won't.  Particularly in rural and semi rural settings communications companies move with the speed of glaciers and that's getting worse, not better.  The markets they're interested in are urban, better yet, urban with populations of a million or better where they can drag the profits in with a conveyor belt.  I'm not being critical here but remember that cablecos, telcos and power companies exist to make money.  The cost per customer in a highly urbanized setting are tiny compared to the cost per customer in a highly rural setting.  The cost goes up, of course, when the rural setting in question is mountainous as it is on the west coast of the Americas where even that impressive mountain you can see out your window becomes an issue for wireless up to and including satellite communications.\r\n\r\nHey, Toto...this isn't Kansas anymore.\r\n\r\nttfn\r\n\r\nJohn\r\n\r\nThis begs the question about people who have a life away from the office, for example, and would like to turn the thing off for a while or do something that won't end up everywhere they go.\r\n\r\nI agree that processing power of hand held devices is increasing but so is the \"soon-to-be-possibly extinct\" desktop.  Laptops are also very powerful now and will continue to become more so.  Adding a PDA/Phone docking station for whatever needs will be trivial.  \r\n\r\nI'll remain rather, more than less, skeptical as long as the world continues to become more increasingly split between MS style proprietary systems and FOSS.  Do you need anyone telling you what you can and cannot do with your device or is that a decision you want to make for yourself?\r\n\r\nThe target, of course, is something like Matthew Roley's \"distributed\" desktop once all the bugs are worked out though I'd suggest that it's more like 10 -15 years down the road before it even becomes practical and univerally usable.  That prediction, of sorts, has more to do with looking at the world now with both open protocols and proprietary protocols, document formats and a host of other things to trip on that have nothing to do with hardware itself.\r\n\r\nA question, though, do you really have to be connected all the time?  Is it necessary to take the office to the washroom with you?  (You'd be surprised how many people actually do answer their cell or crackberry in the loo.) Don't you ever want to turn the noise off?  Keeping in mind that it's healthier than leaving it on consuming power, adding stress and contributing to global warming and all. :-)\r\n\r\n\r\n"
