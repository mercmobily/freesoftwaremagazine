See [our website](http://www.cafamily.org.uk/oss) for more details.\r\n\r\nIn a little bit of self-promotion, those interested in the relationship between Free Software and NGO or non-profits might like to take a look at my FSM column which discusses these things.\r\n\r\ncheers\r\nRyan\r\n[Ryan Cartwright's column](http://www.freesoftwaremagazine.com/columns/8833)"
