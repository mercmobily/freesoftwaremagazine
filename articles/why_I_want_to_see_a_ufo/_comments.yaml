    body: "If you need to believe \"there is something else\", I suggest you try lucid dreaming (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucid_dreaming), if you didn't already... it's really a big booster, for all kind of theories and thoughts (notably on reality), and as an added bonus, though seemingly a \"more serious\" subject, you'll be seen as even more crazy than ever :P (the next step being, imaginary friends ^_^ -and lucid dreaming helps a lot, in defining what about these).\r\n\r\nWell of course, when you are talking about lucid dreaming, to people who seldom, if ever, remember their dreams, who think they \"don't dream\" (well, not that it is inevitably false), who find them irrational, or annoying (and/or scary), and who think they are \"mostly dead\", when sleeping, or that sleeping is \"a waste of time\", and who've been told all these things, since childhood, and it has mostly never been contradicted, since then (contrary to other subjects, like UFOs), in a society like today, you'll obviously not be seen as quite sane ^_^;\r\n\r\nAs for Microsoft vs. GNU/Linux, things are evolving progressively, in favor of GNU/Linux (and xBSD and some other UNIX-like), and in favor for free software, both in the individual, and professional sectors, whatever will Microsoft be doing (except if software price -be it MS softs, or from any other companies- really drops... -because this is why most \"normal\" people, and companies, migrate to GNU/Linux (in addition to trying \"new things\" -not that they would test any new things, however)), so I don't think there is a strict requirement, for OEMs, though it sure would help a lot, to boost adoption/migration.\r\n"
