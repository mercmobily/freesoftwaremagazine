    body: "I just wanted to mention that for many users, Hibernate on GNU/Linux can be even easier. (Especially of interest to those who consider switching from Windows or the Mac and might be scared off by lengthy walkthroughs like this.)\r\n\r\ngNewSense (www.gnewsense.org) and Ubuntu (www.ubuntu.com) both come with Hibernate already configured. So, for the user it's just a matter of clicking \"Shut Down\" -> \"Hibernate\". (I'm sure there are others too, but these are the ones I know.)"

    body: "It was raining heavily with lightning while my lengthy fortran code had been running on my dekstop pc for about a day, I simply hybernated Ubuntu and once the rain stopped I was able to continue from where it's left, This is a very useful feature which really worked and helped me, \r\n\r\nI'm wondering what'll happen if I unplug the computer after hybernating, I'll see if writes the current state to the RAM or to the Harddisk. I'm assuming the latter is true."
