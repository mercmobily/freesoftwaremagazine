    body: 'I am a college student writing an article on the hazards of email interviews.  I would like to know if there is any time it is appropriate?  And, if the loss of face-to-face contact is a problem on the rise for young journalists?  Email me if you would like to respond and it will be in the upcoming Bloomington Source.  Thanks.'
