    body: 'Hi, when you referred to "at least one commercial product", did you mean a proprietary product, or are you saying that we shouldn''t use any software which is produced for commercial purposes, even if it''s free as in freedom? There is quite a lot of commercial free software around these days, and there''s more and more being produced. It''s important not to confuse free as in speech and free as in beer when it comes to software, especially if newcomers to the movement might read what you''re writing.'
