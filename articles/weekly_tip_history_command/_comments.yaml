It will cycle through *only* the commands that begin with 'ssh' and ignore all the rest!\r\n\r\nYou can use this for 'cp' or 'mv' or 'ls' or anything you can think of! Enjoy.\r\n\r\n(I promise I won't write the word 'stupid' again -- oops! i just blew it, didn't i?)"

    body: "Here's another fun one: hit CTRL/R to bring up the \"reverse i-search\" prompt. Soon as you type a character, it will search backwards through the history to find the last occurrence of that character. Type a second character, and now you're looking at the last occurrence of that two-character string. Keep typing until you find the command you want (or you'll hear beeps if the string can't be found). Press Enter to invoke the displayed command, or hit CTRL/G to abandon the search.\r\n\r\nYou can similarly use CTRL/S to search forwards through the history."
