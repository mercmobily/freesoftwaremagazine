Ah, February, the month where the young at heart open their hearts, the older at heart open their wallets and any open magazine has a relationship guide.  In the interest of fostering improved relationships between geeks and non-geeks, this guide lists some common behaviors or opinions according to my non-geek wife (plus some of her tactics for dealing with these behaviors).

And the survey results say.


* I believe there does NOT exist a state of too much RAM, too large a hard-drive or too fast a processor.
* Whatever I'm doing on the computer is important.
* Kids, any liquid substance in your hands and in the vicinity of the computer is evil, very evil.  There are no exceptions.
* GRUB is not a yard pest.
* Long-term efficiency is the two hours I spent working on a project to achieve what could be done manually in ten minutes.
* Forget Vista, I’m busy playing around with [PCLinuxOS 2007-test1](http://www.pclinuxos.com).
* Life is short, that's why I'm in front of this monitor.
* I reserve the right to yell at any idiot who fails to turn off their cellphone ringer during the premier of a "Spiderman" movie.
* Bill Gates may be the ultimate successful geek, but it’s still tacky to post Da Vinci’s Codex Leicester in a Windows only format.
* So many programs, so little time.
* I will forget that my “Eureka” moment at 3am won’t be as exciting for you.
* I am glad to see you, but that's just a USB drive in my pocket.
* It's not news. unless it's on [NewsForge](http://www.newsforge.com/).
* [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/) is more than a gem-stone.
* If the hard-drive makes a screeching sound, take the kids out of the room immediately.  The following language will probably be inappropriate.
* XML, HTML, PHP and LAMP are some of the acronyms that give me a warm fuzzy feeling.
* Life would be much simpler without users.
* After Second Life, I seem to vaguely remember a real life.  Who are these little kids running around here?
* February is a busy month with eight distros to be released according to [Distrowatch](http://www.distrowatch.com/).  Isn't there a holiday this month too?
* That's not music CD's, but LiveCD's on the corner of the desk.
* NewLine Cinema is crazy.  Only Peter Jackson should make "The Hobbit".
* I think “Ubuntu Linux for Non-Geeks” by Rickford Grant would be a great stocking stuffer next Christmas for the extended family.  What do you think dear?
* Bring on the pizza and Dr. Pepper.
* Good lingerie will make you look like a Wii remote.


=ZOOM=“Forewarned, forearmed; to be prepared is half the victory.”  Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra.=

However, my wife has developed responses to these behaviors.  Some of her common coping strategies include:


* Adopting a hobby.  In her case, she took up knitting.  At least we are in the same room together plus she has a sharp stick to poke me if I ignore her too long.
* Using her hobby as an excuse to read blogs and websites about knitting, thus depriving me of access to the household computer.
* Walking away in public areas muttering “I don't know who this guy is.”
* Pulling the main switch on the breaker box and blaming it on a freak storm.

Since we've been married almost fifteen years, it apparently helps to be forewarned and forearmed.  Have a Happy Valentine’s Day.
