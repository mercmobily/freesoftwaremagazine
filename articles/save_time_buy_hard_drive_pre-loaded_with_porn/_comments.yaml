    body: "All I can say is...It's about time. Sextor is definitely on the cutting edge, and I can appreciate their \"no B.S.\" strategy to selling pre-loaded hard drives. I can't remember how many times I'm asked for a \"Midget Pr0n pre-load\" at Best Buy and been given the ol' WTF. I also \"dumbfounded\" the good folks at Dell by asking for a pre-loaded USB \"backup\" drive with the Beatles, U2, and Metallica discographies just in case my 8-tracks melted in the car.\r\n\r\nOn a positive note, I *always* make point of clicking the pr0n ads while downloading Debian ISOs, just 'cuz that's what keeps free software free. :-P"
