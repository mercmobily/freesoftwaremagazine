A long time ago I gave my retired father a computer. Having previously given my mother a computer with Windows 98 on and not being a success for my father I planned things differently and achieved a quite different result.

I wrote my story and ideas down in various places, giving a talk at my local LUG and even getting a short paper published in the British Human Computer Interactions Group "Interface" magazine.

Next month I'll be giving a revised and extended version of the LUG talk to the UKUUG Linux'08 meeting in Manchester. It should be an interesting event - even if it'll be a little less technical than hardcore kernel talks.
