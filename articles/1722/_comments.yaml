If you made a choice to get a card with free software drivers, you've been royally screwed, since NVIDIA and ATI are the only ones who get any real attention from the X monkeys.\r\n\r\nSince modular X and GTK2.6+, my Matrox has gotten so slow compared to Windows (I dual boot) that it is a humiliating experience showing it to anyone -- and no, it's not a configuration screw-up... it's just that the code has gotten slower. \r\n\r\nDespite the Matrox G400+ being popular cards, with capable 3d support (my g550 can run Q3 at a good resultion with a decent framerate with high detail), AIGLX doesn't support it, and neither does XGL.\r\n\r\n"

    body: "Why does there have to be two 3D technologies (GLX and AIGLX)? What a waste of resources.\r\n\r\nNvidia supposedly supports AIGLX over GLX, but their support is confined to words - there is no driver. What sort of support is that?\r\n\r\nThe open source 3D software DRI is dead in the water - no open source drivers for any hardware this side of the year 2000. So either get a time machine or you are stuck with proprietry drivers. An open source framework that depends on proprietry drivers is far from ideal. RMS cannot be pleased. Somewhat of a joke in fact (but only Nvidia and ATI are laughing).\r\n\r\nApparently Intel is opening up its current drivers and is about to release their graphics chip on a card. Not the fastest 3D but probably good enough for the desktop. This might be the best thing on the horizon. Lets hope they get the texture-from-bitmap support to enable AIGLX.\r\n\r\n"

Should we therefor abandon Linux and the BSD's? GLX doesn't depend on closed source drivers. It relies on any driver that has proper OpenGL support. The fact that most of these drivers are closed source is an unrelated, if unfortunate matter."

Moreover, the free nv driver included with Xorg (starting form xfree86) was provided by... Nvidia.\r\n\r\nIt is true however that Nvidia keeps mum about their hardware specs, making developing a free 3D driver difficult (right now, the Utah-GLX driver badly supports Geforce2-level hardware; interesting hardware acceleration started with Geforce3, then Geforce 5)."
