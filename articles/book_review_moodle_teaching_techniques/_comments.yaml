    body: "Absolutely it would be \"free\" to students and faculty. My point is that this is a small feature in the insanely over priced Blackboard 9 upgrade. So... while it is \"free\" to students and faculty, the BB9 upgrade takes a massive amount of time and resources for the given University's IT staff. Hopefully this is not the only thing exciting in that upgrade.\r\n<a href=\"http://fullscreenmovies.net/\">buy dvd movies</a>\r\n"
