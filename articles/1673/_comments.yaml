Later-on they were talking about a dutch tradition where when a mother tells her child a bedtime story and can't come up with an ending, by the end of each story an elephant would suddenly appear out of nothing and with his long trunk, he blows the story away. Then someone in the animation-team said suddenly \"elephants dream\". Well, you know the rest. I guess the ending of the film is quite similar to the ending of such a bedtime story..."

    body: "Thank for very much for reviewing Boy Who Never Slept and for both the harsh and kind words.  \r\n\r\nUnfortunately I think you completely missed what I was trying to say, considering you're well outside my target audience, thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s expected.  You seem to get seriously upset about the moral stance you believe this movie took.\r\n\r\nFIrst, the story in this movie may not be ideal, but the theme reflects reality.  Also youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be glad to know that the story isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t autobiographical.  I would also like to send a clear message to anyone reading this: PLEASE use common sense in your relationships, and I absolutely don't advocate sleeping with underage girls.  IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m releasing the full script this week, I invite you to read it, and you may pick up on some of the subtleties you may miss in the movie. \r\n\r\nIdeally I didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t want to have to explain why I made this or that decision and leave it open to artistic interpretation and just welcome the controversy, but when my film is being mentioned next to Birth of a Nationand described as an advocacy for sleeping with underage girls, I think itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s important to explicitly state what this movie means and what some parts of it represent.\r\n\r\n\r\nWatch any modern chick flick with a teenage girl target demographic (one by Hillary Duff or Lindsay Lohan will do).  YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll find it filled with Ã¢â‚¬Å“fateÃ¢â‚¬? Ã¢â‚¬Å“soul matesÃ¢â‚¬? and Ã¢â‚¬Å“meant to beÃ¢â‚¬? philosophy.  These are very popular movies and represent the beliefs embraced by lots of teenage girls.  I would even say the majority of teenage girls, but I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have the data to back up that strong of a claim.\r\n\r\nThere are many accounts of relationships, (some ending in marriage and children) where the girl met the guy and become Ã¢â‚¬Å“involvedÃ¢â‚¬? before she was the current Ã¢â‚¬Å“officialÃ¢â‚¬? age of 18 (or 17 if you're in Las Vegas).  That is NOT a show of a support, just a note or social comment.\r\n\r\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Love conquers allÃ¢â‚¬? as long as youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re both within the right ages, so if one of you is 17 and the other just turned 18, then it doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t apply.\r\n\r\nIt's interesting how people often try to reconcile beliefs that, in practice, contradict eachother. If you believe in \"true love\" it's obviously not bound by minor age differences. If it makes you enjoy the movie more, think of Daniel as 19.  Very little in the script would have to change.  23 was chosen arbitrarily.  I just needed an age over 18.\r\n\r\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Fate brought us togetherÃ¢â‚¬?, but if everything else doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t coincide perfectly, then itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not fate just ignorance.\r\n\r\nWeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re Ã¢â‚¬Å“Soul MatesÃ¢â‚¬? destined to be together; of course we could just be in a superficial relationship\r\n\r\nOne of the greatest love fantasies in movies, novels, and other artistic works is the Ã¢â‚¬Å“love conquers allÃ¢â‚¬? theme.  Where two people meet by fate and come together despite social constructs, taboos etc.  I gave you what this would really look like, not a beautiful fantasy story with a superfluously happy ending, but a lonely young man who lacked common sense and a normal teenage girl, both lonely and desperately wanting to find \"love\".  Not just any love ,but the magical \"love that conquers all\" they see in the movies and read about in  novels. If you ask an average teenage girl if she thinks Ã¢â‚¬Å“true loveÃ¢â‚¬? between a 23 year old and a 16 year old is possible, I bet sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll answer with a resounding yes.\r\n\r\nOne of the biggest points of my story that unfortunately didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t come through strong enough for many people to pick up on was this:\r\n\r\nI believe fiction highly influences reality, the philosophy ingrained in movies, novels, books etc, affects how people think and influences their character (I'm not saying this is bad or good; I'm just stating my belief).  With this stated, I find it very interesting how people embrace, even love fiction that perpetrates philosophies completely opposed and in direct disagreement with their personal beliefs, and see no irony or hypocrisy in this.  This is not in reference to Ã¢â‚¬Å“realityÃ¢â‚¬? or hyper realistic movies that are a reflection of real life, but fantasy based fiction.\r\n\r\nMelissaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s father loved DanielÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s script, liked the sexuality and the uncompromising emotions and power of the Ã¢â‚¬Å“love conquers allÃ¢â‚¬? theme, but absolutely went crazy when he found out it was about his daughter. \r\n\r\nIt was a great script when it was about someone else, but when itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s about his daughter, it automatically becomes disgusting, and Daniel automatically becomes a sexual predator deserving of statutory rape.  Notice that decision was made before he ever spoke to Daniel or even considered how they met, etc.  So in fiction he endorses that philosophy, but in reality he is automatically opposed to the very idea and instantly labels Daniel a criminal.  I find this somewhat hypocritical.\r\n\r\nWhy would Melissa like a \"loser\" like Daniel? \r\n\r\nIt is difficult to apply all their romantic ideals and notions of love they're inundated with to the average, immature teenage guy. Referencing Hillary Duff and Lindsay Lohan movies, for example, you'll notice that the male actors who ususally play the love intereste are all relatively mature compared to real teenage boys. In fact, the actors themselves are often quite a bit older than the actresses, further cementing the idea that an \"older man\" is more capable of \"romantic\" love.\r\n\r\nWhy did Daniel even start talking to Melissa?\r\n\r\nIf you have ever been in an internet chat room, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll notice that people chat with all kinds of different people and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not uncommon for individuals of all ages to be in the same regional chat room; thus Daniel meeting Melissa online was very probable.  \r\n\r\nYou also mention a lack of substance in Daniel and MelissaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s conversations in your review.  Please check out an internet chat room and you'll see people talking about very normal stuff.  Most people in there are not having award winning intellectual chats - this is about real life, and people are lonely and mainly just want someone else to talk to.  The subject of their conversations is of less importance then the emotional connection of having someone to vent to, to share their thoughts with and who appears to understand them.  That's all it takes to inspire steps towards meeting and seeing if they connect in person.  \r\n\r\n\r\nI made Daniel a would-be writer not to Ã¢â‚¬Å“impress chicks,Ã¢â‚¬? but for the following reasons:\r\n\r\nPeople fantasize about stronger than reality emotions. Perfect relationships, perfect people, perfect jobs, perfect etc.  It seems like a normal part of life Ã¢â‚¬Å“fantasizingÃ¢â‚¬? about the ideal.  Read any romance novel or watch any recent romantic movie.  I find this to be especially true in the case of would-be artists like Daniel. \r\n\r\nDespite the complex drama contained in their everyday life, they continually look to romanticized accounts and stories for inspiration.  Like I said before, they fantasize about the ideal.\r\n\r\nDaniel wants to be a writer, because he wants to experience this super emotional even Ã¢â‚¬Å“magicalÃ¢â‚¬? view of life.  The dark and dreary scenes are on purpose  Daniel is stuck in a rut, and going nowhere, because heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s looking for something Ã¢â‚¬Å“magicalÃ¢â‚¬? Ã¢â‚¬â€œ his fantasy version of Ã¢â‚¬Å“love.Ã¢â‚¬?  \r\n\r\nHeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s lonely and drinks a lot; it makes perfect sense that he would be intrigued by Melissa and what she represents. HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not looking for reality, but wants to find something amazing, to be Ã¢â‚¬Å“blown away.Ã¢â‚¬? Many people donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t look for reality when searching for love, but hold off, at least secretly, for a super mate, or some kind of unstoppable love slike that so often portrayed in cinema. \r\n\r\nAdditionaly, Daniel was NOT trying to meet a younger girl; it simply happened, as it does every day.\r\n\r\nYou call their relationship purely superficial and that bring up two questions from me.\r\n\r\n1.\tCan a teenage girl have a non-superficial relationship?   I don't think most parents tell their children, Ã¢â‚¬Å“all your relationships will be meaningless until youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re 21Ã¢â‚¬?\r\n2.\tWhatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the difference between a real relationship and a superficial one and who should judge that ?\r\n\r\nMany thousands of people have already seen the movie, and they range in all age/gender demographics. I generally receive responses in two categories:\r\n\r\n1) Those that endorse the love conquers all philosophy and bought the characters, meaning they liked the movie and were glad Melissa and Daniel met each other (note that many in this category are female).\r\n\r\n2) Those that don't believe in true love, bought the characters, and enjoyed the movie as a story of someone with no common sense and for its comedic value.\r\n\r\nOut of the thousands of people who've already seen it, this is the first response I've found that so misinterpreted the intention and moral stance of the movie.  It is the most completely negative response I've received, and the first negative response in regards to the story line.\r\n\r\nBecause of this, I wonder how much your own world view, your philosophy on love and morality, and the fact that you have a daughter played into the extremely negative response to the story line of the movie.\r\n\r\nAs for what I believe, I won't say. film is the art of storytelling. I want people to be able to enjoy the story without any more direct influence on my part than I've already given (again, I didn't want to write this article, but it is important to clarify when someone so wrongly interprets the moral stance of your movie). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI invite you all to comment on the movie directly on my website.\r\nhttp://www.solomonrothman.com/boywhoneverslept\r\nJust click on the comments link from the main site and please be respectful!!!\r\n\r\nAs for me, more movies are coming soon and some will contain slightly more traditional themes.  I love screenwriting and filmmaking, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s my lifeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s passion. I have 2 completed scripts and 10 more drafts ( I just worked all night on polishing up a horror script that should be really fun and very scary).  So far IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve received a very positive response to Boy Who Never Slept.   \r\n\r\nLast Note:  Boy Who Never Slept was designed to be a movie anyone could made ($200 dollar budget all amateurs, etc).  I wanted to inspire would-be filmmakers and to some degree I have from the comments IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve received thus far.  My next films will be of superior technical quality as I progress in my filmmaking abilities.\r\n\r\n"

    body: "I'm not aware of any law in the world that prohibits \"true love\" between a man and a young woman, even if he's 23 and she's 16.\r\n\r\nIf a man actually loves a girl, it follows that he wants what's best for her (that's what love is -- that other thing has a different name), and it is very unlikely that that includes sex under any circumstances, and absolutely under the ones depicted. That immediately puts the lie to Daniel's claim of \"true love\", as far as I am concerned.\r\n\r\nYour objections to young girls' fantasies about love actually underscore the reason why we have the legal idea that minors are not truly capable of \"consent\" to sex. That doesn't mean they can't say \"yes\" -- it means that even if they do say \"yes\", they are not mature enough for their judgement to be trusted. Up to a certain age, we rely on the parents' judgement instead.\r\n\r\nIf Daniel actually loved Melissa, then he has two perfectly valid options: 1) he can maintain a solid relationship with her for the 2 years it's going to take for her to become \"legal\", before attempting to seduce her (if that's a problem, then once again, it ain't \"true love\"), OR 2) he can make the case to her Dad BEFORE acting irresponsibly, and get permission to MARRY her (and if that's a problem...). That is also legal.\r\n\r\nYou argue that it makes no difference if Daniel is 19 or 23, but that isn't quite true. We might argue that he might be forgiven for his transgression on the basis that he too has only lately reached the age of consent if he's 19 (as a matter of fact, I've learned that Texas law recognizes this as a defense). However, at 23, he's toast if he hasn't figured that out yet: he's definitely old enough to know better.\r\n\r\nMore to the point, the film itself makes it entirely clear that Daniel knows exactly what he's doing. He knows it's wrong, and he does it anyway. Rather than letting him take the fall, though, you arrange a serious of miracles to get him off the hook, so the film actually does have a \"fairy tale\" unrealistic ending. \r\n\r\nThat's why I say that the film comes off as advocacy. You, as the writer have manipulated events into an unrealistic outcome in which the offender receives no consequences for his actions. It's as if you want to reward him for his behavior.\r\n\r\nHowever, this isn't actually the problem. One could still tell a very convincing story about the idea, and my Birth of a Nation reference was to make the point that a film can be significant even if the ideas of the film are disturbing or offensive.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, BWNS falls short of that goal. It's characters are not well-enough developed, nor the situations well-enough conceived to pull off this kind of story. You're attempting a heavy dramatic weight, but the result has little impact. This is ultimately because of weak characterization (which in turn is largely due to a lack of context: we don't know enough about the characters or their situations in life for the images presented of them to have much meaning), poor detailed writing (the IRC chat, for instance, is unconvincing -- oh sure, I've seen online conversations this pointless, but I don't think they end in \r\nanyone feeling they've found their \"soul mate\"), weak camera direction, and limited performances (due to amateur actors and director).\r\n\r\nPlease recognize that it is these problems (and not my mismatch to your target demographics!) that make the film fall short of communicating your intentions.\r\n\r\nNow, of course, I'm very conscious of the fact that many of these problems are due to you being a new filmmaker and due to the extremely limited budget, and therefore limited casting possibilities. I have myself been involved in some pretty bad movies for similar reasons (movies which, with any luck, will never see the light of day -- there is actually a silent student film out there with me as an actor. Thankfully, I have never actually seen it, though the director did tell me that I should seriously consider keeping my career <em>behind</em> the camera!).\r\n\r\nThat's why it's not entirely fair to criticize the film on a \"major league\" basis. But on the other hand, publishing your work as an actual film release is asking for legitimate artistic recognition: you're stepping out of the zone of fan-fics and ego-petting and into the harsh light of day. It's no favor to a real artist to flatter them.\r\n\r\nI hope that doesn't discourage you -- you probably just haven't quite \"found your voice\" yet, and that's nothing to be concerned about at this point.  As Barbara Sher (Wishcraft) would tell you, you should start with the ambition of making \"bad movies\", and reserve making good ones as a later step.  Or as they say, \"most overnight successes were 20 years in the making\".\r\n\r\nThe remarkable thing is that we even get to see what you've done at this level. I hope we do get to see more and better things from you.\r\n\r\nI have some more comments on a more technical level, but I think I'll save that for a later opportunity. It's been suggest to me that I should do a follow-up on free filmmaking -- that may be the time.\r\n"

    body: "This movie was realistic in many ways.  If that offended T.H. he doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t live in the real world but in an isolated box!\r\n\r\nI have a real life example that I will compare to this film.  My sister was 15 years old when she met a 24-year-old guy.  When asked how old she was, she lied. She said she was 17 and a half.  The guy called her all the time, they developed a relationship and then he learned her real ageÃ¢â‚¬Â¦.too late he said, he was in love, she confessed her love to him, and sure enough she got pregnant.  Yes, my parents considered throwing him in jail.  But what good would that have done?  He had good intentions; he said his love was real.  So the two got married.  No surprise that after the second child they divorced but the real surprise came IN REAL LIFE when they got back together two years later and had 3 more children. They have been together since.   I wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t judge RothmanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s film as being anything but a portrayal of living in a society where peopleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s thoughts and dreams and expectations have been grossly shaped by the media and unrealistic romantic films.   \r\n\r\nNow IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll really shock you Mr. Hancock.  I am a Christian and I write Christian romance novels. I keep them clean and real. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve read far too many that have the same old cliches, the same old plots, the same unrealistic expectations, because thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s what sells; the Cinderella story or Sleeping Beauty. \r\n\r\nHave you seen the movie Ã¢â‚¬Å“10 things I Hate about You?Ã¢â‚¬?  Now that was realistic, and was certainly exploiting young women, but done in Hollywood fashion so as to make it a Ã¢â‚¬Å“comedy.Ã¢â‚¬?Visit sites like MySpace.  Young people today are recreating themselves and representing themselves extremely sexually. \r\n\r\n The real world that Daniel lives in is a world where young people are starting relationships on the Internet everydayÃ¢â‚¬Â¦. and while some do become genuine friends, many have put themselves at risk, and others have developed relationships.  \r\n\r\nDaniel is not a predator; if he was 30 or 40 than I could understand that assumptionÃ¢â‚¬Â¦but heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s college age, and most college campuses have 16, 17, and 18 year old girls walking through campus, going to football games and dating freshman.  ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the real world.  And people like you tend to blame the guy and let the girl off the hook, saying sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the victim. Melissa knew what she was getting into.  She made the choice to pursue the relationship; she bared her chest on the net, so get off your soap box and visit the real world!!!\r\n\r\nThis film is one that ought to be viewed by parents who are out of touch with their kidsÃ¢â‚¬Â¦so they can better grasp an understanding of how powerful emotional feelings of Ã¢â‚¬Å“loveÃ¢â‚¬? can overtake ones objectivity, and common sense.  And I hope young people age 16 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 23 will watch this film; they could learn something from it.\r\n\r\nAs for maturity, most men/women donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t grow up until they are 25 and up; some take even longer!!  \r\n"

If that offended T.H. he doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t live in the real world but in an isolated box!\r\n\"\"\"\r\n\r\nWhat you are arguing here is that the <em>premise</em> of the film is realistic, with which I concur. It's certainly possible for this kind of situation to happen.\r\n\r\nI've definitely let this slide too far into discussing the moral dimensions of the plot, but that was really just a side point.\r\n\r\nDoes the film <em>tell</em> the story well? Are the characters believably presented? I know I don't think so.\r\n\r\n'Why not' is complicated. As I've mentioned below, it's mostly lack of context, which is a problem with the script-writing. There are also problems with the acting -- the actors are self-conscious and as a result, the viewer is constantly thrown out of the story. There are also a lot problems with video and audio quality which renders some lines incomprehensible. Some of these things can be fixed in post-production. As I suggested, it might be possible to cut it down to a much shorter film and make it more watchable. However, quite a bit of the problems go right down into the writing and would require re-shooting to fix.\r\n\r\nSince my purpose here is to look at the implications of these works for free-licensed open-source filmmaking, I find that an important point. A work of text can be edited by anyone and thus even such fundamental problems can be fixed. Not so with live-action film. This is a severe artistic limitation, and I've run into it with audio production before: if you want to do a cast performance of something, you've got to have the writing nailed beforehand, or you have to have a long-term commitment from the actors.  Because it's going to be a real pain if you rewrite after the fact and then have to get somebody else to do the lines. You're kind of stuck.\r\n\r\nEven \"realistic\" drama is about more than simply \"capturing life as it is\", or we'd all watch security cameras for entertainment.  So, there's a lot of craft that needs to be done right in order to make a story understandable and believable on film.\r\n"

One of the things that immediately struck me about both films as an artistic experience is that they invite you to take the pieces and improve upon (or adapt from) the work.

    body: "ok, i think this is perhaps the worst movie review i've ever read as i absolutely loved this film. i'll qualify that by saying that i rate it at 8/10 taking into account the budget and the inability of all the actors to fully carry off their roles ie - if you read between the lines and allow yourself to imagine it as the scenes were intended, rather than listening to the words and moaning that they are too shallow.\r\n\r\ni'll put into context the kind of movies i find interesting. the most recent few listed below.\r\n\r\na scanner darkly (can't wait for the release in the uk)\r\nthe final cut\r\neternal sunshine of the spotless minds\r\ndonnie darko\r\nthe butterfly effect\r\ncloser\r\ngarden state (prob my fav film of 2004)\r\n\r\nthis film is very real. some of the 'guy' dialogue made me laugh as i've heard so many similar conversations in real life. perhaps the age difference is more important than you realise terry - although i don't for one minute want to imply that i can match your experience.\r\n\r\nit's interesting to view this film from the perspective of an englishman. here sex with a 16 year old is actually legal. i must admit i was uncomfortable the only time i dated a girl that young as an 'older guy' (at only 19) and wanted to wait (because of her age, i was not a virgin at the time), she didn't so we split up, so i'm not supporting the guy in the film from personal experience. however i really don't feel that criticism of this film on the basis that the plot is 'sordid and offensive' is reasonable at all. in fact such comments suggest to me a lack of emotional maturity to some degree. although i fully understand the 'it's my daughter' feelings you have. but if you think what girls are often really like... the 16 year old i referred to earlier was so sexually aware it was scary to me at 19 then it puts a different perspective on things.\r\n\r\nin the past i've had a girl send me semi naked images of herself and various similar events on the net. i'm definitely not a sick sexual preditor... but unfortunately it's something that actually 16+ girls seem pretty comfortable with in real life, and i'm going back 10 years to when i was that age, who knows how much further it's come since then as media and the continuing change in 'morality' in society futher changes things. imagine she's 17 which would be legal in some parts of the usa. i don't really see how you can justify such a pedantic application of age to classify him as an 'offender' who needs to receive some sort of punishment. i think he is too old for the case i remember reading about but similar cases have not been prosecuted despite the parents wishes in the usa so clearly there is some judicial support for a view of some common sense of consent from 'children' of an age where they can after all jump in a car, drive round the corner and kill someone in an 'accident' but heaven forbid they do something like make love to someone they have feelings for.\r\n\r\nas for the lack of violence in the film... i'm sorry you're disappointed that the parents aren't a couple of common thugs. can't you hear the daughter crying for the guy she clearly has feelings for? how does lowering yourself to the level of a street criminal make you better than the guy in the film who falls in love? i don't even fully agree that the dialogue isn't fully convincing. it's carefree and fun like a lot of young ppls conversations. would you prefer they discuss the latest book by pilger (freedom next time) and the horrendous oppression of the palestine??\r\n\r\ni liked the way the father loves the story until he realises it's his daughter. i think that's a clever and very true insight into the human mind. perhaps i wouldn't agree with the 'love' angle if it was my 15 y/o daughter and a 19 y/o guy. but one thing i'll definitely say is that prison is no place for someone in that situation, too youngsters in love.\r\n\r\napologies for being so sharp, but i was really expecting an awful film after your review, and gave it a chance after reading the directors rebuttal of your comments and i really was surprised with what i saw. looking forward to more of his work.\r\n\r\nthe most important independent film of all time.\r\nterrorstorm. available at google video video.google.com\r\nor goto www.infowars.com or prisonplanet.tv for alex jones news and media"

I've watched movies that I wanted to reedit. I remember wanting to take Star Wars Episode II and put back in the characterization scenes that Lucus cut out. I also wanted to reedit The Lord of the Rings to make special Frodo quest, Aragorn quest, and Arwen+Aragorn versions that were short enough to watch in one night. These were fantasies of mine, but with open source movies and a will, such things may be possible.\r\n\r\nMy first impression of the movies was that Elephant's dream looked cool, but was too short and artsy. I thought the boy who never slept was annoying to watch because I couldn't hear what they were saying. It also wasn't my genre.\r\n\r\nBut when I think of reediting it, I'm limited. I'd have to re-dub the entire thing with new voice actors to make up for the bad sound. I'd want to tighten up the editing because despite its short size, it felt too long. \r\n\r\nIf I did re-do this film, I'd probably make it an opera.\r\n\r\n\"I'm a bored and lonely guy____\r\nSleep with the girl and don't ask why___\" \r\netc.\r\n"

    subject: 'User Generated Revolution in Show Business?'

    body: "A new revolution is taking shape in the movie industry that challenges traditional filmmaking to the core. Spurred by a newfound passion amongst movie lovers to create their own content, thousands are coming together to form communities that will create movies via collaboration over the web. There’s no stopping this wave, as community film budgets get bigger and bigger; an ostensible threat to filmmakers, who are already struggling to get their share at the box office.\r\n\r\nThere is no business like show business. There’s definitely no arguing that. But what happens when show business is not merely the prerogative of the elite, but calls for participation by “regular” folks like you and me, who—lets face it—would probably never get a chance to play any kind of a role in the entertainment business in a lifetime?\r\n\r\nWelcome to the new world of User Generated Filmmaking – An exploding community of thousands of movie lovers who do not merely carry a license to “watch” movies, but rather, to make what they want to see, when they want it. Sounds too good to be true? Not really.  \r\n\r\nIn a way, these communities are performing a role reversal, if you will, on filmmakers and traditional filmmaking. The output of their collaboration results in a movie, much like any other; but the way that these movies are made is where the difference lies. The community does everything. They call scriptwriters (a heady mix, ranging from professional scriptwriters who simply love collaborating, to housewives, hobbyists and the odd nana, all united by a common passion for movies and filmmaking). A moderator, or the “alpha male” is swiftly appointed and the collaborative scriptwriting process begins with frenzied and fanatic discussions on online forums: “You write the first scene and I’ll follow your lead. May be you are being a tad too adventurous here with the central character. This is NOT a sci-fi thriller so lighten up!”\r\n\r\nCollaboration tools like MediaWiki (the same technology that powers the amazingly popular user generated encyclopedia Wikipedia) and the new gun in town, Basecamp, provide the perfect solution to help these communities thrive. Their simplicity allows even technophobes to participate without hesitation. \r\n\r\nOnce the script reaches a stage where characters have been sketched and dialogues written, casting for the film begins – again over the web! Anyone from anywhere in the world can audition online by uploading their talent audios and videos, which the community swiftly begins sifting through. Performances are rated, feedback is given, and the new stars of tomorrow are born. \r\n\r\nThen, traditional filmmaking processes takeover – locations are decided, cast and crew grouped together and shooting begins! \r\n\r\nA perfect example of such a revolutionary filmmaking project is the aptly titled “Lets Film” project (www.LetsFilm.com). The project aims to create an ambitious action-packed, high intensity movie (that would understandably need a big budget for special effects and stunts!) completely online. Although it is not clear who is investing in and backing the project, the site has already raced to forming a neat little community online that’s buzzing with excitement. \r\n\r\nSo, if you have dropped off the kids at school and have some time on your hands, why not make a movie in your free time?      \r\n"

A lot of other open-source projects require searching around for hours to find everything you need just to play with it.\r\n----------------------\r\n\r\n"

    body: 'Having tried both Jahshaka and Avidemux extensively, I can safely say neither comes anywhere close replacing After Effects or Final Cut Pro. Avidemux is essentially iMovie or a powerful Windows Movie Maker and Jahshaka is just filled <a href="http://gadgetswebstore.blogspot.com">cool gadgets</a> with bugs and empty promises. Cinepaint, however, is a fantastic tool for a very specialized niche. I’d love to see an open source alternative to the big NLE’s but so far the closest is Cinelerra which is a LONG way to go.'
