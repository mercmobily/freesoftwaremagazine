    body: "What made the Library of Alexandria amazing was not just its size, but its breadth - it supposedly contained virtually everything published in the western world. Saying that Gutenberg is larger than the Library is damning it with faint praise - 23,000 volumes is not a large number for even a community library. The key issue this number should bring up is the need to reform copyright laws so that the flow of works into the public domain is resumed.\r\n"
