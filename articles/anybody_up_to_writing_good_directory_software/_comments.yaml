    body: "You know of <a href=\"http://directory.fsf.org/\">The Free Software Directory</a>, don't you? It's just that it lacks most of your wanted features, but it's a start.\r\n\r\nAs it is, I mostly use Wikipedia to find new free software. As Wikipedia is a peer-production itself: the longer the article, the more popular the software is :-D (kinda like a voting system)...\r\n\r\nBut yeah, I agree with you, would be nice. But if you are techsavy you'll find your way through Savannah etc. or if you are not, you check your Ubuntu repository, or worst-case; you don't care (or know) about free as in freedom and stick with Windoze and Freeware..."
