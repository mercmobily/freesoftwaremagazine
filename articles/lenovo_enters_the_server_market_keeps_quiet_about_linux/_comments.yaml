    body: "> Back in April 2007, Lenovo announced that it would “offer a wide selection of low- to high-end machines be loaded with Linux software from Novell Inc.”. ... What I do want to point out, is that some ten months later those laptops are nowhere to be seen.\r\n\r\nIt seems that they are now going to start [delivering on that promise](http://www.news.com/8301-10784_3-9850633-7.html). That said try finding anything on their website about it!\r\n\r\nThis is one of the things that shows me that vendors are still not taking GNU/Linux seriously. If Lenovo were about to launch servers that ran a new M$ server OS they would make a big song and dance about it--adverts on the homepage etc. . With GNU/Linux it kind of slips out quietly as if they didn't want M$ to notice what they were doing. So nobody hears about it, thus nobody buys them, thus the \"experiment\" is deemed a failure!\r\n\r\nWith regards servers, perhaps we--free software users-- can mount a campaign. If they see enough demand they'll may change--eventually. It worked with Dell :o)\r\n\r\ncheers\r\nRyan"
