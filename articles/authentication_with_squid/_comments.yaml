The only backhaul we have is Satellite, so we have to treasure our bandwidth. We are tinkling with NoCat at the moment. This article opens up a new possibility of a whole new system all together. Of course, we have to think of how to block all traffics that squid cannot proxy, or else there will be holes in this system (`iptables'' to the rescue!). Also, how to tunnel other traffics via HTTP.'

If you did, that'd be weird... but anyway it seems that your \"PHP machine\" already has STDIN defined, so you can comment line 3, where it's \"redefined\"... or remove that whole checking section altogether (the conditional and definition of STDIN).\r\n\r\nHope that works."
