    body: "I, like many here (I assume) have dabbled with DSL. I've used it on friends' Widows boxes when they've had problems and they've been as amazed as I was at how much they managed to screw into 50 MB - and the skills required to do such a job.\r\n \r\nHowever the projects chapters were the big surprise to me. I've dragged an old (original) Pentium laptop out of a cupboard just to marvel at turning it into a music server or a LAMP server - obviously the authors' imaginations are much freer than mine.\r\n\r\nAs the review says \"light on theory, heavy on practical\" - Granny might have to be pointed to chapter 2 where it would tell her how to get into BIOS to boot from CD, but that's about all the help she would need.\r\n\r\nA superb little distro, and a superb book to 'accidentally' leave at a friend's house when you leave - just make sure you get it back.\r\n\r\n"
