<p>Puru Govind has posted a short article about the controversy over what to call our favorite OS: <a href="http://www.osweekly.com/index.php?option=com_content&Itemid=&task=view&id=2242">Linux or GNU/Linux.</a></p>

<p>For many of us here, this is an old controversy and a constant source of angst and frustration. I know I've given up trying to convince my friends and colleagues to use the more respectful term (GNU/Linux!). I just make sure I use it in my own speech and, if anyone asks, I'm happy to explain. I'm curious about the folks here. Do you bother to correct people who say "Linux" when referring to the OS?</p>
