Mainly because he just sits there. Since he didn't start out as a character, though, that shouldn't really surprise anyone. He just has no back story\"\r\n\r\n    Do you mean like the eagle in USA symbols ?\r\n\r\n    I think it has not a name even.\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>Comment from: Mantar [Visitor]</strong>\r\n\r\n    01/10/06 @ 05:25\r\n    I'd agree with this. I always thought it was cool that I could blast a Red Bauul with a shotgun in Cube, and then with a fireball in S.C.O.U.R.G.E.: Heroes of Lesser Reknown. There's an ongoing FF:Tactics-type game project which is (temporarily) using the sprites from Battle for Wesnoth, and someone suggested that any new art be kept within theme, to create a sort of Wesnoth: Tactics instead of just dropping in some other ad-hoc fantasy universe.\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>Comment from: Terry Hancock [Member] Ã‚Â· http://www.anansispaceworks.com</strong>\r\n\r\n    01/13/06 @ 03:22\r\n    \"Do you mean like the eagle in USA symbols ?\r\n    I think it has not a name even.\"\r\n\r\n    I think maybe you are trying to present a counterexample, but yes, I do mean like the American Eagle. It may be a great propaganda icon (albeit pretty unimaginative -- the US is not the first country to use an Eagle as a symbol).\r\n\r\n    But the American Eagle is only an icon. Sam Eagle is a character.\r\n\r\n    The difference? People are engaged by characters themselves, not just the things they advertise. Tux is really good at selling Linux, but how much do people really get interested in Tux as a character?\r\n\r\n    And Tux is the best we've got so far."
