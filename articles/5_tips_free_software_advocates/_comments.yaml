    body: "I seriously doubt that, Ryan. Do you really think fewer people are writing free software (I would guess that the number is increasing substantially each year, myself)?\r\n\r\nClearly, the _ratio_ of developers to users is falling, but that's (most likely) because the latter is skyrocketing, not because the former is declining or even leveling out.\r\n\r\nIt is certainly important for users to learn community-support skills. Attitudes learned from proprietary support channels are often pretty (self-)destructive when applied to free software, not to mention the fact that they encourage very low expectations.\r\n\r\nOften, the best \"documentation\" for free software is simply the body of stories about how people solved particular problems. Searchable mailing list archives often turn up useful information given a large enough body of such lore.\r\n"

So your ratio description is better put.\r\n\r\nI agree that documentation includes sucess stories but only if they contain something more than \"It worked out of the box!\". The problem is that as the typical user profile shifts from developer to consumer, the ratio of people who feel they are able to contribute drops. I encounter too many new (by which I mean \"under a year\") users who feel they don't know enough to do anything except consume. Yet these people can very much help those following behind by writing about their experiences and the things they found that were different in their brave new world.\r\n\r\n*edited: forgot something*\r\n\r\nAnother point I meant (but didn't explain so well) was that of the later crop of new users, fewer  seem to be contributing back. Whether this is because they feel inadequate as explained above (further puporting the idea that there are two classes of free software users) or because they don't know how or just plain don't \"get it\", I don't know. But my main point stands, advocating free software is more than just recommending the product, it includes advocating the ideals and community and reasons behind them.\r\n\r\nBut thanks for prompting the clarification anyway  \r\nRyan"

Fine if it's not approrpiate to say it right at the start but somewhere down the line if we neglect to introduce them to the concepts and benefits of \"the community\" then I feel these users are missing out on half the fun.\r\n\r\nAlso I don't think I am saying what your article states. I am not demonising users who don't contribute, I am bemoaning the fact that a lower percentage seem to do so or are given the opportunity. In fact, I have rarely come across someone who does demand the things your seventh point argues against. To me that makes it a slight straw-man argument.\r\n\r\nI firmly believe that _all_ users at _all_ levels _can_ contribute in many different ways. I also believe that by doing so free software itself becomes a better fit for a greater number of purposes. I do not expect, demand or require any user to take part but I will always recommend they at least engage with what is loosely entitled the \"community\", in order to make it and their experience better. By doing so I am also trying to help users out of their dependency upon us techies. I believe that if you educate, encourage and empower a computer user you will both reap the benefits. When it comes to free software, helping them to discover this organic, dynamic and sometimes dangerous thing called the community is part of that process.\r\n\r\nA fairly new user may well have gained some knowledge and experience which will help those migrating today. Do they _have_ pass it on? No. Can they contribute to society in other ways? Of course but I'm not expecting them to devote all their time to free software.

My book and all my other popularization activities introduce digital freedoms to the general public. Digital freedom is lots of interrelated things, Free SW is just one of them and certainly isn't even the most important, but I do stress the fact that what's important to care about the issues in order to become active, helpful and responsible citizens and to build a better society (=community of communities). So I don't do #2. I do mention that all this movement came out from communities, from the bottom, and explain why whenever there is time.\r\n\r\nI just don't see any pressing need or real benefit in (personally) going farther, that is on insisting on #1: at the same time, see last link I provided, I do ask all the time that everybody supports Free SW with their votes and their wallets, because that is essential, and much more urgent than getting people subscribed to some Linux mailing list.\r\n\r\nPart of the reason for working and suggesting others to work in this way is the unescapable reality that the people we need to convince today, as soon as possible before OpenXML and assorted laws screw everything up, are those who hate software and computers. People who would *pay* me and you just to stop asking that they write one email more than absolutely necessary.\r\n\r\n<i>I firmly believe that all users at all levels can contribute in many different ways</i>\r\n\r\nI agree with this and all the rest of that paragraph, but as a goal for the future, a medium/long term objective.

Note this is not the same as saying: \"You must show and guide every new user you come across\".\r\n\r\nWhilst I agree with the idea of asking people to support with their votes and wallets, I am concerned here with the idea that free software advocates will introduce a new user to the software and then leave them all alone.

If it's about how to teach FOSS to kids in grade school, then you're 100% right.\r\n\r\nWell that's part of it but in reality it's about combatting the low opinion most computer users have of their skills. I have taught many who say they are completely hopeless with computers. This is most often translated into being too scared to try anything. Confidence is the main enemy of people using computers IME. When it comes to using free software even seasoned (but self-confessed non-techie) Windows users can end up thinking they have no part to play, no skills to offer. Thus they revert to being too scared to learn how to use their software. Encouraging them to engage with the community is part of the methodology I use to help them gain confidence. Once they realise the other people in the forums are (mostly) just humans they tend to understand more of what's going on and through that they tend to ask less questions of me as they can find the answers themselves. Thus they feel less of a burden (they're not but they feel that way) and thus they start to ejoy using their computer again.\r\n\r\nCase in point: a retired friend of mine who had zero confidence in using a computer. I taught him how to use OOo and showed him how to take part in the OOo forums. He started by posting comments on how helpful some tips were. Then he asked a few questions of his own. Now he is answering some of the simpler questions himself. The big difference for him is that he has the confidence to do so and engaging in the community behind OOo helped him in that.\r\n\r\n--  \r\nEquitas IT Solutions - fairness, quality, freedom\r\nhttp://www.equitasit.co.uk"

It is the weakness, or distance from reality, of that single assumption that separates our \"default strategies\".\r\n\r\nWhen you write that \"...by nature [new users] consider themselves too new to be able to write documentation etc...\", you are not simply saying and believing that new users feel themselves inadequate to making any contribution. You may be assuming that they <b>suffer</b> from this, that they WOULD like so much to contribute, that they just don't know how and are just scared to try.\r\n\r\nThis assumption (that \"doing software\" in any way, from coding to writing manual or posting simple tips is so wonderful, empowering and enjoyable that no functional human being could possibly resist doing it, when properly supported) may very well be what keeps a proper \"pro-FOSS\" attitude from spreading in the masses.\r\n\r\nThe world I live in is a world full of people who, in 90% of cases, will lend you money, assist you if you're sick, help the homeless, volunteer in many different fields, participate in civil disobedience and \"contribute to the community\" in a thousand other ways... but simply turn their brain off and ignore you if you try to push them into any sort of \"doing more software stuff than they absolutely have to, in order to get on with their lives\". There are (at the very least) 50 people like this for every one like that retired friend of yours.\r\n\r\nThat's where my approach comes from: I don't want to scare away the other 49.

My statement and therefore viewpoint is based upon what the majority of the new users I have contact with have said to me. I make no claims that \"doing software\" is something that will change your life for the better. I certainly never suggest it is a replacement for helping society in other ways.\r\n\r\nLet me be clear here: what I am saying is that when I encounter new users who _want_ to use their computers more, _want_ to find out more about it, _want_ it to be more than a box in the corner and accept that to change that would require some effort from them, I find an increasing percentage who end up feeling they somehow can't contribute to free software because they lack the skills etc. and hence they give up (this is not an assumption but something based upon what they've said or indicated to me). That fact alone saddens me. How, when or where they otherwise contribute to society is often admirable, always varied and mostly nothing to do with the issue of wanting to use their computer better.\r\n\r\nI also often come across people who just want their PC to get out of their way -- as you describe. I explain to those people the advantages of freedom in software but I make no demand or expectation on them for even using it.\r\n\r\n> Act and talk as if it's just natural for everybody to like software, and you'll scare away from FOSS the overwhelming majority of human beings who couldn't care less of looking \"inside\" a computer and already know plenty of much more familiar and fulfilling communities to be part of.\r\n\r\nMarco, this is another straw man argument. I have not said or even implied anything like that and I don't know anybody who does. In fact many software/computer lovers I know tend to assume they are in a minority and everybody else is a nay-saying luddite instead of a real person. My target for this piece was the advocates who -- in their enthusiasm to get the free software message out there -- don't always allow for the human beings you mention. I, personally have enthusiasm for software and free software in particular but I'm not naive enough to expect everybody else to be the same.\r\n\r\nIn the end we can go back and forth like this for ages but I think we're coming at the same point from two different angles. You seem to br approaching it from the wider angle of freedom in general and whilst I pretty much agree with your viewpoint, in this piece I am just simply talking about how people interact with their software.\r\n\r\ncheers  \r\nRyan\r\n--\r\nEquitas IT Solutions - fairness, quality, freedom\r\nhttp://www.equitasit.co.uk"

    body: "Ryan, good article.\r\n\r\nI think the current trend amongst users is to slowly switch from a geek community to commodity customers - i.e. \"I paid for the product\", whether they mean the Internet connection (a standard product also includes shipment...) or a virtual value of 0$. When you map this to common marketing courses, the geeks are the \"early adopters\", the ones who have a strong relationship with the provider. The big crowd that comes later (and I mean in particular the professional environments) look for solutions to solve a particular problem they have and, often, will discard the product before they contact the provider - it all depends on the price of the competition. For them, relationships with a provider are costs and they will invert in it if they get a greater value than the cost itself. In the context of FOSS, it is unfortunate - and recent legal battles are a proof of it.\r\n\r\nI´m not saying that FOSS should be banned from professional environments but  this problem will surely be recurrent in the near future. As you say, our role is to invite people to contribute in whatever way they can - be it answer forums, mailing lists, writing article... or code."

In itself, it's not a problem, but rather a sign of success.\r\n\r\nThink of it this way: if you're in business, and your \"market share\" declines from 100% to 20%, but the total size of the market has increased by a factor of ten over the same period, then you've actually _doubled_ your sales (20% x 10 = 2).\r\n\r\nSomething very similar is happening here, and that's really the point I was raising earlier. The population is changing due to the influx of end users, not some decline in the active community. This results in some dilution, which can be an issue, but absolute size is more important for the development process than percentages are (software quality will be closer to a function of the _absolute number_ of people contributing useful bug reports, than to the _fraction_ of the total population).\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it's not going to hurt to let people know about the benefits of contributing more to the process of creating free software. It's a lot of fun, and it makes things go a lot easier when everything doesn't just work straight out of the box (an experience that is going to happen with _any_ software, free or not).\r\n\r\nOne of the problems that happens (possibly due to over-zealous marketing of free software) is that people think they're getting \"something for nothing\" and that they can get the same sort of support they get from proprietary software without paying for it.\r\n\r\nOf course that's not how it works. With free software, you have  an option you don't get with proprietary software: you can choose to participate in the community support process. If you do, then indeed, you don't have to pay cash for support. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it is going to cost you some time and effort. And it is a _different_ process, so you have a learning curve to deal with.\r\n\r\nI (and apparently Ryan) think that's a good trade, so we'd rather go the \"community process\" route.\r\n\r\nHowever, we have to be careful when marketing free software not to create a false impression that you can \"have your cake and eat it too\": if you want to avoid paying money for support, you're going to have to accept the nature of the community support process, which requires a larger time commitment.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, you're going to have to realize that while _acquiring_ free software usually costs little or nothing, _supporting_ it is going to cost you money (probably more than for proprietary software, at least at present*). And of course, that gets into Ryan's caution about price comparisons, which is \"right on the money\", if you'll pardon the pun."

But Ryan's article leaves this unclear so that, to the reader, the distinction may not be apparent, and yet it is very significant.\r\n\r\nAs for your OOo Writer example, no this is the not the scenario I envision when I talk about participating in the \"community support process\".\r\n\r\nI'm talking about when said English teacher goes on to an online forum and tries to find out from other users how to twiddle the various settings in Writer's configuration menus (I assume this is possible, I don't really use OOo much).\r\n\r\nIf OOo were a typical proprietary product, the process would be quite different. Most likely, there would be a manual included in the shrink-wrapped package, which would explain a lot of these details. Also, there would be a support phone number to call. There would also usually be a good book on the subject in the local bookstore.\r\n\r\nAlthough, strictly speaking, all of these options might exist for OOo, in practice they are not so well-organized. You probably can find an OOo book if you know which publishers to check, or you can search for it on Amazon, but the options will be more limited than for market-leading proprietary packages. You probably can get phone support for OOo, too, if you go the right people, but finding it may be really, really hard. Finally, there is probably a free PDF manual somewhere that documents the configuration menus in OOo, but it's probably very poorly written, hard-to-find, and you still have to print it out and bind it (or read it on the computer, which some people find very distasteful).\r\n\r\nLikewise, there _are_ online forums where users of proprietary software get together to support each other without the cooperation of the software creators. However, these community forums are usually _pathetic_ by comparison with free software counterparts.\r\n\r\nIOW, I'm not really talking about the direct causal consequences of the licensing, but rather about the support cultures which surround these products in practice. _Good_ support for free software, usually means the _community_ support. The formal support is usually not so great.\r\n\r\nIt has also been my experience that, when you know how to make use of community support, free software community support is far and away more useful than proprietary products' formal support channels.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if you _don't_ know how to use community support, and can only make use of formal support channels, you are likely to find most free software very lacking in comparison to proprietary options.\r\n\r\nThis is why I agree with Ryan that teaching people how to use community support is good free software advocacy: those people will quickly find that free software is better supported than proprietary software.\r\n\r\nOf course, I also agree with you, Marco, that we really should work to improve the formal support available for free software.\r\n\r\nHowever, good formal support costs _money_. Good documentation is like good leadership: when it works, it's invisible and therefore unappreciated, and when it doesn't, people vastly under-estimate how much effort it will take to get it working.\r\n"

    body: "> If OOo were a typical proprietary product, the process would be quite different. Most likely, there would be a manual included in the shrink-wrapped package, which would explain a lot of these details. Also, there would be a support phone number to call. There would also usually be a good book on the subject in the local bookstore.\r\n\r\nI've not bought a shrink-wrapped proprietary product for some time. In fact the only one I've been involved in related to site licences and downloads. I've not seen a manual of any kind with proprietary products for years. I see help files but they are not the same. And as for a support number - really? I've only ever been offered support for a proprietary product by an ISV but that was a paid for extra. The best I've ever been offered as part of the software package (in any capacity) was 60 days e-mail support.\r\n\r\nI agree about the book but in my experience the support options for both proprietary and free software amount to the same. You want support? You pay for it or you go on-line and ask your peers.\r\n\r\ncheers  \r\nRyan\r\n\r\n_PS: Marco - I agree with Terry -- no real flames here just lively debate and discussion._ :o)\r\n\r\n--  \r\nEquitas IT Solutions - fairness, quality, freedom  \r\nhttp://www.equitasit.co.uk"
