Please keep in mind, that what you see as a great step forward in personal freedom for some, has been achieved by denying certain people their freedom or even killing them. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the rest, I like your article.\r\n\r\n<hr/>\r\n\r\n<strong>From</strong>: Haakon \r\n<strong>Url</strong>: http://far.no/\r\n<strong>Date</strong>: 2006-02-17\r\n<strong>Subject:</strong> Freedom from business as usual - not\r\n\r\n\r\nYou write about OpenOffice.org, presumably version 2.0:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Naturally, it does have some drawbacks, too: the Outline view isnÃ‚â€™t as nice, incompatible with any macros youÃ‚â€™ve developed (and Word Macro viruses), envelope printing is confusing, merging to a catalog list doesnÃ‚â€™t seem to exist. Are these features worth the extra $300 per seat in your business?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYes, wouldn't it be worth it? The minimum wage in the US is $5.15 per hour. If the work took an hour without mail merges, and mail merges saved you half an hour, you have saved $2.075 every time you use it. To break even you would need to use it 144 times, $300 / $ 2.075 = 144. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThen you have to add that using mail merges, you only need to create one template and the computer fills in the addresses and other fields automatically, recardless of how many recipients you have. You probably save a lot more, breaking even a lot sooner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLuckily, mail merges are available in OpenOffice.org, so it is business as usual.\r\n\r\n<hr/>\r\n\r\n<strong>From</strong>: wotp \r\n<strong>Url</strong>: \r\n<strong>Date</strong>: 2006-02-28\r\n<strong>Subject:</strong> Argument by analogy\r\n\r\n\r\nI like the comparison of the past and present to the locomotive method of trains and car. However, I worry about the validity of such a conclusion as, \"But the more people who choose to drive free software, the more roads will get paved.\"  This seems to imply that is only a matter of time before free software becomes the dominate method of computation. The production technologies for trains and cars both stemmed from large companies which were more similar to each other in productive methods than Microsoft would be to self-organizing free software developers. Where are the limits to this analogy? Could you support this prediction by other means?\r\n\r\n<hr/>\r\n\r\n"
