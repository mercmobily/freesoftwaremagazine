    body: "The problem here is the definition of \"troll\".   Calling someone a \"troll\" has become an instance of Godwin's Law -- it stops all argument.\r\n\r\nI think that the troll-calling has become excessive...and in fact, some of the \"anti-troll\" measures are now being called to extreme, to the point of down shouting opposition.\r\n\r\nCase in point: calling people who question any aspect of Global Warming orthodoxy a \"denier\" -- and thus linking them with doubters of the Holocaust (more Godwin).\r\n\r\nBottom line: the ultimate filter is the human brain -- an advanced quantum neuro computer that should be able to make decisions on its own -- not with the aid of edicts, or \"manifestoes\".\r\n"
