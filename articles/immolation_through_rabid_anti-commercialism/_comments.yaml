    body: "The principle of free software and free culture is not that all such art must be made <em>available</em>, but that people should be free to do whatever they want with the art that they are given or that they purchase.\r\n\r\nThe principle is LIBERTY. \r\n\r\nThere is no requirement that you must make your work available, nor that you must price it at $0.\r\n\r\nThe only obligation of liberty is that if you convey a copy your work to someone, that you don't attempt to prevent or prosecute them for making their own copies or derivatives.\r\n\r\nSome people get confused by the GPL - which is unfortunate. The GPL says if you do convey a work to someone, then attempting to prevent someone making derivatives also includes obscuring or obfuscating the work, i.e. delivering it in binary or otherwise unintelligible form.\r\n\r\nThe GPL does not say you must make all your work available. It only says that when you do deliver a derivative, this must include the plaintext/source code version - or at least it must be made available to the recipient of the derivative. It's only if the source code is provided separately that it's meant to be free of charge (or cost of media+postage).\r\n\r\nAs for \"Information wants to be free\". As you know, this is not the libertarian principle (or even the gift economist one), but an epiphenomenon of our instantaneous diffusion infrastructure that we call the Internet.\r\n\r\nIt just means that it's difficult to sell valuable information to one person at a time - and the more people the information is valuable to, the quicker it spreads, consequently saturating and eliminating the potential market. You need something like the <a href=\"http://www.digitalartauction.com\">www.digitalartauction.com</a> to sell digital art to many people all at once.\r\n\r\n"
