    body: "I uprgraded my laptop to windows XP home edition. Turned the laptop off, and the next day turned it back on and it wouldn't come on. I tried re-installing windows but it wouldnt take. \r\nNow it is telling me to insert my windows XP cd and when I do it is telling me that \"setup could not read the cd you inserted, or the cd is not a valid windows cd.\r\nPlease insert your windows nt 3.51 workstation, windows nt 4.0 workstation, windows 2000 professional, windows 95,  windows 98, or windows millennium cd into your cd-rom drive.\r\nwhen the cd is in the drive, press ENTER.\"\r\nI dont have any of these cd's and I have tried to download and install the openoffice os to try to boot the laptop up and nothing is working. I made sure that the cd drive is the first place the laptop went to on bootup and all it says is ntldr is not found? I tried putting the ntldr file on disks so that the laptop reads it when it boots and it still says ntldr not found.\r\nI use the computers I have for my organization to help homeless people and we receive all our computers from donations which we have not obtain (computer donations) since 2005\r\nWe have so many clients that every penny is used for them and we cant even buy a used computer and at this time we are working with that laptop and two desk pc's, the other 4 died.\r\nI need help fixing this laptop so that I can continue our work with the homeless. And yes we are 501(c)(3) approved. [EIN # 04-3654929].\r\nCan you direct me to where I can get an operating system that will automatically boot when the laptop comes on so I can re-install an os on it?\r\nI can also be reached at salaam_ul_muslimiyn@yahoo.com, or Box 210130, Brooklyn, NY 11221."

    body: "You can get free Ubuntu live cds from here:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.ubuntu.com/\r\n\r\nYou can either download the iso file and burn it to a disk OR you can request that they send you a disk for free.\r\n\r\nIf you have set your BIOS settings to boot from a CD first, you put the disk in and it will boot into an operating system that runs from the CD in RAM. Nothing is written on to your hard drive at this point. You will be able to play around with it first (if you want) but you will see an install icon on the desktop. Click it to start the install process. \r\n\r\nTry going through those steps first. If it doesn't work I would suggest that you may have a hardware problem and you might want to find some help switching out different components.\r\n\r\nUbuntu is a free OS and it comes with EVERYTHING you will ever need. Don't ever use MS products if you can avoid it. If you are a charity it is better to give people you free software that doesn't spy on them and doesn't leave them vunerable to spyware and viruses. \r\n\r\nYou should check out this article:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.freesoftwaremagazine.com/articles/free_computing\r\n\r\nWhich explains how you can recycle old chuck out machines into working PCs again.\r\n\r\nYou might be interested in contacting your nearest Linux user group (LUG) too:\r\n\r\nhttp://home.netcom.com/~casandra/linux/lugdetails.html\r\n\r\nI am absolutely positive there will be someone willing to help you with your charity work at any of these groups. Free software people are like that. I know if I was living nearby I would bring a disk round and show you through it. But I'm thousands of miles away.\r\n\r\nHope this helps.\r\n\r\n"
