# Poll Results—How worried are you about trusted computing, DRM, and software patents?

51% of you were “very concerned”—the out and out winner of this fortnight’s poll. This was followed by 28% of voters falling into the even more concerned category of “extremely worried—they will eventually kill free software”. 14% were “a little concerned”, a tiny 6% were concerned “not at all—it will pass” and 1% had a different opinion. However, most of the comments this week reflected the poll results—very concerned!

# This fortnight’s poll

[How do you feel about the idea of governments mandating the use of free software in their countries?](http://www.freesoftwaremagazine.com/polls/governments_mandating_free_software)

Freedom is a big word with a lot of weight on it. And while most migrating governments are only mandating government use of free software, what would you think if the use of free software was mandated through all major public and private organisations as well? Is this more freedom or less?


# Reminders

**Comments**

Your comments on articles, issues, and blog entries are very welcome. They provide other readers with insightful suggestions, further information, and the feeling that they are not alone. They also provide our authors with the feeling that they are being heard. Please comment wherever possible and **don’t forget to log in** so that you’ll be in the running to win the [latest book competition](http://www.freesoftwaremagazine.com/blog/1).

**Avatars**

Avatars are a great way of expressing your personal identity, whether it be a photo or an image that you feel represents the you you want to be. Read more about avatars [here](http://www.freesoftwaremagazine.com/node/1713). To add an avatar: log in, go to “my account” in the menu on the left, go to the “edit” tab and scroll down to where it says “Upload picture”. Now, hit the browse button, find the image on your computer that you want to upload and go to the bottom of the page and hit the submit button. That’s it; you now have an avatar image.
