I don't know whether there are any legal issues with the codec used, but pragmatically, it worked fine with the stock Debian VLC I have installed.\r\n"

    body: "Disagreeing with someone, no matter how strongly is not \"hate speech\", and I do not \"hate\" Republicans.\r\n\r\nI do disagree with them (sometimes violently) both in fundamental values and in strategic thinking, and I think there is ample objective evidence of the latter problem (the former being subjective by nature). I also have some disagreements with Democrats (as evidenced by my comments on the financial bail-out), though clearly not as many.\r\n\r\nOne cannot simply check one's values at the door when considering the politics of intellectual freedom, and I am certainly under no obligation to avoid talking about politics here, particularly as they impinge upon issues of importance to the free software community.\r\n\r\nPresident Obama, in contrast to past Presidents of the US, has embraced new media outlets, the internet, and (apparently) free content to a much greater degree. IMHO, that has more to do with his age than his party affiliation -- but whatever the cause, it is a good thing from the point of view of our community."
