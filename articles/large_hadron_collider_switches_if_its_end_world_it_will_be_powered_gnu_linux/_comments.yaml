    body: "on the transformative power of openness. Another point for those interested is the formation of \"grid computing\" where distributed clusters co-operate to solve problems (and store data). Libris, which allows you to do this in a way that the information cannot be \"snuffed out\" or surpressed, is an important tool for cluster/grid/cloud computing. To see how these ideas work on a small scale (or a big scale if you have the budget) try PelicanHPC http://pareto.uab.es/mcreel/PelicanHPC/, or if you dont mind a distro that hasnt been updated in four years, Cluster Knoppix.\r\n\r\nMy bet is that the Standard Model add-ons are wrong, and there is no Higgs. But the new bestiary of heavy particles will make everybody forget all about it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Do what you can, with what you have, where you are.\" - Theodore Roosevelt"
