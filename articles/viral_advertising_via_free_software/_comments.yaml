    body: "I think that's a quite good idea. Someone like Sourceforge could even make a business out of bringing the developers and the advertisers together and get similar to Google some percents of.\r\n\r\nAbout free software games: I don't understand why there aren't more 'bigger' ones. Because I think it would fit the bazaar quite good to produce the engine and the content as free (as in freedom). The game would be created as a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commons-Based_Peer_Production\">commons-based peer production</a>. The engine being free software and developed as usual for free software projects, the content (levels, characters, story, etc.) would be created more like Wikipedia. \r\n\r\nIn this way a truly free game could be developed by many people, each contriguting what he/she can do best. Look how many <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mod_%28computer_gaming%29\">mods</a> are made for commercial and proprietary games - all of them by fans that just wanted to habe their ideas in the game. I imagine that it would be a lot easier to create mods for a totally free game, and if we could provide a place where these could be shared easily, a lot of content could come together quite fast. If the game were to be for example a role-play game, different users could create different story-lines or quests that the gamer just could download and play.\r\n\r\nLook how fast Wikipedia grew, wouldn't that be possible for a computer game too? We just have to come up with a development strategy to coordinate the effort volunteers are willing to spend. What do you think?"

    body: "I think this is a really good idea. I think it could be pretty successful. I expect this kind of approach will start to be used quite soon, as more and more people realise that free (as in freedom) software and other creative works aren't \"anti-commercial\" or \"communist\". This approach has recently started to be used by Revver for free (and partially free) videos under Creative Commons licences.\r\n\r\nOn the topic of free software games, I think the reason they get less attention than other programmes is probably because they're made for their aesthetic value rather than their functional value, as artistic works are, which is why people are less interested in modifying them. There are an increasing number of big ones being released though. The developers of Second Life are planning to release the game as free software after a while, and switch to using free and open protocols, and id Software release the game engine to games such as Quake III under the GPL after a while (although not the actual game content). There's also a campaign to buy the source code of the MMORPG Ryzom and release it under a free software licence (ryzom.org), as the company that develops it is in financial trouble. I think MMORPGs are probably the genre of game most likely to be released as free software in the near future because of their democratic nature, and because most of the money made from them is often from subscriptions to the game servers, rather than from licence fees from proprietary software."
