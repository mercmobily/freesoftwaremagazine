It's complicated (look at the Rage line and weep).\r\nAs such, unfortunate owners of shared memory adapters are left behind due to no proprietary driver support (Ati doesn't bother) and very little open-source driver support (it's very complicated, and lacks specifications).\r\nOn Nvidia's side, their chipset lines are much less complicated (that's what the Nouveau project seems to say at least); moreover, most of their products are supported by the proprietary driver. Still, their Turbocache cards have little to no support (fully shared memory: yes, fully chip-owned memory: yes, cached shared memory:no) but since I don't have any of those cards (waste of money), I can't say more.\r\n\r\n---\r\nA computer is like air conditioning: it becomes useless when you open windows."

Once there, you must parse the /var/log/Xorg.0.log file (if it's located there in your distribution) and see if AIGLX is enabled (you can type \"less /var/log/Xorg.0.log | grep AIGLX\" as root to get an idea fast). If it is, then you can try to install Beryl (either compile from sources, or get packages for your distro) and run it (usually through beryl-manager) to see if it works.\r\n\r\nBut I'm afraid a Tnt2 is a bit too flakey to run it in a pleasant fashion.\r\n\r\n---\r\nA computer is like air conditioning: it becomes useless when you open windows."

However I think someone over in Matrox's user forum has updated an unofficial matrox driver to get Xorgs new version >1.4.2 to work with the hal.\r\nI have now tested the Xorg 1.4.4 mga video driver version and that seems to take care of issues with G400 (just a side note, I had originally forgot to remove Option \"MGASDRAM\" from my G450 configuration when I originally tested the G400 with SGRAM, it didn't crash the Xorg server but just appeared like dri was locked up with no output).  So now I can confirm that the Xorg 1.4.4 mga driver in 7.1 does work with the G400/G450.  I have not tested the unofficial matrox driver with hal so I can't confirm that.

    body: "     Well, I went in full bore trying beryl out on several systems.  I'm running gentoo ~x86 (the \"unstable\" branch).  I threw some fairly high bitrate MPEG4 640x480 video up to see how things ran.\r\n\r\n     The short of it.. Geforce4MX, i915, and r100 do run beryl fine.  The Geforce even supports XV-accelerated playback fully, 915 works with xv but \"mplayer -vo x11\" allows the video window to behave better, and r100 was I think too slow for xv, but \"mplayer -vo x11 -framedrop\" worked.\r\n\r\n     AthlonXP 2200+ system, with integrated Geforce4MX.  768MB DDR RAM, and 128 given to the card.  the 9631 driver has some texture problems (glxgears or the like looks great, some games don't.)  Also a ~30 second lockup when I start X (without beryl..)  Beryl doesn't help the games but doesn't hurt anything either.  Everything seems just a smooth and fast as native..  CPU use goes up 5% points or so if I'm jiggling windows etc.. not much at all.  mplayer's xv output works perfectly with all this.  8776 driver avoids the game problems, but beryl runs very slowly with it.\r\n\r\n     Dell notebook, Celeron M 1.4ghz, and i915.  xv uses a color-key, so having a plain video window sitting on the desktop works fine, but dragging it gets blue artifacts until the window quits jiggling, and it turns blue as soon as you rotate the cube, it's blue in the task switcher, etc.  \"mplayer -vo x11\" playback works with all special effects though and the system is plenty fast for it.\r\n\r\n     Where I work (a surplus store) a few people have been trying for about a month to piece together a high-enough spec system to play w/ Aero.. no dice.  I went the other end of things w/ Beryl, and threw it onto a PII450, 256MB of RAM, and a PCI Radeon DDR card.  All but the video playback worked great!  The videos needed framedrop and pegged the CPU without beryl, so under beryl they were pretty bad.  I put the card and drive into a PIII866 (still 256MB of RAM).. I still needed framedrop, but it worked pretty well.  xv stuttered oddly, I think because the memory bandwidth was being maxed out by all that compositing etc.  x11 playback worked fine.. I was getting 25-30FPS usually (playing a 30FPS video), with it dropping to 14FPS or so if I started jiggling windows etc.  The CPU peaked at 80%, so this wasn't CPU limited.  Either the PCI or (I think..) the memory bandwidth of the card was being maxed out.  It still was jaw-drapping to see a machine that old keep up with the latest and greatest.. I knew academically Aero's requirements were quite inflated, but wow.\r\n"

The screen runs at 1280x1024.. with beryl, the background cut off and is just white on the right edge of the screen.  If I had to guess, maybe the texture cuts off at 1024 width?  If I made the web browser full-screen the whole thing turned white.. resizing it to >1024 width caused problems too.  Dragging windows uses about 50% CPU but was a smooth 40FPS (as inidcated by benchmark).  If I didn't run benchmark the konsole text was jerky, maybe updating 2-3 times a second as I typed.  With benchmark on (even with the rate limiter left on) it showed 40FPS and konsole was smooth.  Window jiggling etc. was smooth.  Video playback, the constant updates mplayer throws into the konsole just killed the card and video playback, but if I got that mplayer text offscreen, video played fine with xv.. but had the blue box while window dragging etc. similar to other xv-playback setups.  \"mplayer -vo x11\" got about 5FPS maybe, with high CPU usage.  The windows still jiggled smoothly while the video chugged though.\r\n     I'd say it's probably \"usable\" at 1024x768 or below, but more a curiosity than REALLY usable.\r\n"

The 96.x versions do support it, and basically redirect all overlays to a GL texture (you'll get identical results using xv and gl/gl2 in mplayer). The 97.x releases have been quite optimized: video is much less jerky (I'm nitpicking: I'm the only one at home to notice it). I haven't tried too many games with it though - the ones I tried did work though.\r\n\r\nThe Radeon PCI problem is more than likely a PCI bus bottleneck: you could try overclocking the PCI bus to see if there's any improvement (PCI is clocked at 33 MHz natively, but most cards can deal with a PCI bus at 42 MHz) and disabling as many extension (cards, integrated peripherals) as you can: it should help a lot.\r\n\r\nThe G400 problem looks like a driver problem (texture cutoff at 1024, yes).

    body: "AIGLX is not a 'workaround'; it is, on the contrary, an extension made to X11 to allow use of GLX (OpenGL for X11, not X11 in OpenGL) in window management.\r\nIt aims at providing a 3D compositing window manager all the necessary extensions to work without requiring a 'special' X11 server - what XGL is.\r\nA brief recap of XGL: it starts a standard X11 session, with a single, full-screen window opened in it; this window uses GLX, and contains yet another X11 server (XGL) which is 3d-compositing capable, but all elements in it are in 3D (it creates a single 3D contexts) with all 2D parts emulated.\r\nNow, AIGLX: an improved X11 session starts, and checks GLX's capabilities. If those meet the requirements for AIGLX, it loads. Now, all normal elements work as usual: hardware overlays (Xv, etc.) clients don't have to run on the same machine the server runs on, etc. but if the WM wants to use 3D, then 3D is made available to the WM; however, those elements that don't require 3D are kept as-is.\r\nIn short, XGL emulates an X11 server inside a normal X11 session; this allows it to emulate some essential functions required by a 3D WM, by making it one step removed from the actual driver; it also reduces the number of functions reported supported by X11, facilitating fallback to some selected rendering paths which can then be optimized.\r\nOn the other hand, AIGLX introduces 3D to all functions already supported by X11; this makes it harder to implement, however it allows better flexibility: for example, XvMC (X video Motion Compensation) can now use a 3D approach if there are no dedicated on-chip functions with a driver, and allows it to switch from one to the other instantly. The inconvenient, AIGLX requires (for the sake of efficiency) hardware support for GL_EXT_texture_from_pixmap since most of the work is being done directly in the card's frame buffer (which is emulated in system RAM by XGL) and DRI (as a consequence of working directly in Video RAM, you can't use CPU copies without a huge performance impact).\r\nIn fact, AIGLX cannot work on non-3D hardware, for the very simple reason that it aims at performing screen compositing and operations directly in video RAM - making it work in software 3D would require heavy back and forth memory copies, tricky Video + system RAM management, or emulating a 3D card - which is essentially what XGL + Mesa do.\r\nIn absolute, is Mesa emulated all functions required by, say, Compiz, and Compiz didn't check for hardware support, you could make it work in software using XGL+Mesa.
