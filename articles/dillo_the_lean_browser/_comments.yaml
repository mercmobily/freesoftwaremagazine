    body: "I've just downloaded and been using Dillo and it is a very good application. It is the only browser I've ever used - except lynx - that loads instantly (without requiring 3G of RAM that is). It renders well but there are some features which I find it lacks which make it almost impossible for me to use even for a \"quick browse\":\r\n\r\n* CSS support: pretty much all sites I visit use some kind of CSS now and without it, Dillo is now more useful than Lynx.\r\n* Keyboard control: I'm a hacker and I've always preferred keyboard controls so I use things like CTRL-D to enter the address bar. Dillo's lack of support for even the most rudimentary keyboard controls just ends up irritating me.\r\n\r\nNow I appreciate there is only so man y features you can give a browser before it stops being lean but these two really inhibit my use of Dillo.\r\n\r\nI don't know C/GTK+ but I'll take a look at the site and see if there's anything I *can* do. 'Cause you know I just dont have enough projects on right now."
