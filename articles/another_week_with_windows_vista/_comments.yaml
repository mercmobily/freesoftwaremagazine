    body: 'I bought a laptop with Vista pre-installed and have no issues with it.  It took about 4 hours to remove all of the junk files but the OS is stable.  Of course, the laptop is mainly used by my wife for internet access away from home so just about any OS will work just fine.  The wireless drivers do work which is a lot more than I can say for my laptop with Mandriva and I spent more than 4 hours trying to get them to work.'
