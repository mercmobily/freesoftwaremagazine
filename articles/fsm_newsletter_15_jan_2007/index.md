# General announcements

So here we are at the beginning of a new year, and here at Free Software Magazine we certainly aren’t slacking off! Because we believe we can continually improve the site for you, we are currently working on the new version of the web site that should be finished shortly. Of course, because we are Free Software Magazine, we are proud to contribute to free software and will release the CMS code under the GPL. So keep your eyes out for our flashy new site soon!

# Poll results for last fortnight—What’s the main reason why you use free/open source software?

Why use free software? The winner of this fortnight’s poll was “To be part of and support the free software movement” scraped in with 39% of the vote, closely followed by “It’s free as in freedom” with 36% of the vote. These two were followed by “It’s free as in cost” and “Other reason” both on 9%, and lastly, 6% of you said “It has a great support community”. Most of the comments stated that the “Other reasons” included security and stability—and the ability to be creative with your computer use!

# This fortnight’s poll

[What kind of articles would you prefer to see in Free Software Magazine?](http://www.freesoftwaremagazine.com/polls/what_kind_of_articles_would_you_prefer_to_see_in_free_software_magazine%3F)

It would help us in deciding what articles to assign if you can let us know what you want to read. Pick your most preferred article type and, if you’re finding it really hard to decide, write a comment listing your preferences in order.


# Reminders

**Comments**

Your comments on articles, issues, and blog entries are very welcome. They provide other readers with insightful suggestions, further information, and the feeling that they are not alone. They also provide our authors with the feeling that they are being heard. Please comment wherever possible and **don’t forget to log in** so that you’ll be in the running to win the [latest book competition](http://www.freesoftwaremagazine.com/blog/1).

**Avatars**

Avatars are a great way of expressing your personal identity, whether it be a photo or an image that you feel represents the you you want to be. Read more about avatars [here](http://www.freesoftwaremagazine.com/node/1713). To add an avatar: log in, go to “my account” in the menu on the left, go to the “edit” tab and scroll down to where it says “Upload picture”. Now, hit the browse button, find the image on your computer that you want to upload and go to the bottom of the page and hit the submit button. That’s it; you now have an avatar image.
