  Background: [OpenDocument](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenDocument)  format was approved as an ISO standard in May 2006.  This was  important for the free software community because there are free  software applications for reading and writing OpenDocument files.

  It was also good news because we could now ask governments to use  this standard instead of existing proprietary formats.  Most  governments currently use Microsoft's Word format, and while we have  software to read and write that format, our software isn't perfect,  and it will never be perfect because we can't see the specification  of that format.  As a counter-move, Microsoft then applied to have  its format also approved as an ISO standard.

  Recent events: Microsoft requested that their format approved  by a "fast-track" procedure.  The fast-track procedure is  appropriate for applications which don't contradict existing ISO  standards.  The Grokdoc website did a great job of examining Microsoft's format  and [building a  list of where it contradicts existing ISO standards](http://www.grokdoc.net/index.php/EOOXML_objections).  There were  then efforts in many countries to inform national standards agencies  of these contradictions so that they could raise these when responding in ISO's  discussion of the fast-track request.

  This request was discussed by ISO and its national mirror committees  on February 6th, and the request was rejected.  So Microsoft's  application will follow the usual, more detailed process.

  For supporters of OpenDocument, we also have to learn from this  process.  We repeated some of the same mistakes made in the [anti software patents  campaign](http://fsfeurope.org/projects/swpat/), and those were that we overloaded some people in the  national standards bodies, and sometimes we were not well informed  of what we were talking about.  [Here's  more information](http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/fsfe-uk/2007-02/msg00017.html).

  There's no way to say what the right balance  between making ourselves heard and holding back until we understand  the issue is, but the general lesson to take from this is that we have  to remember that the people we're sending letters to are humans, and  humans like short, on-topic communications.
