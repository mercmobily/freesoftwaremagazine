    body: 'See, I slightly agree that consciousness is a "fundamental property of matter", but I''d argue that there is nothing notoriously special about it (other than we''re the only manifestation).  It IS A fundamental property that emerges out of the arrow of time and some of the most complex, multidimensional and simultaneous math around that your head is programmed to handle.  I''d almost argue that having a brain with intelligent consciousness is almost analogous to having a form of matter that goes through a phase change.  Without all the pieces there (primarily the cerebral cortex), you aren''t able to meet those "special conditions" that allow a true "self" to come up.  Animals can be conscious, but that doesn''t mean they are intelligent.  Intelligence, to me, is the key factor here.  Intelligence is the next "bar up" in our universes order of magnitude from consiousness.  Perhaps the next step in Intelligence won''t require consiousness until it''s next "singularity" (IE, Vinge''s AI singularity).  Can robots do everything right without being alive?  (I''m also coming from a "progression of order and intelligence in the universe" creed too, so it may be that it''s just another possible step, rather than a necessary one).'

    body: "Honestly, I really am at the edge of my knowledge on this subject.\r\n\r\nIt might've been better not to mention it, so as not to misrepresent, but I hate to not acknowledge where I got an idea, even if it is pretty marginal. And Voodoo gets such a bad rap in popular culture, that I like to point out that it has some original and interesting ideas. I wish I knew more about it than I do.\r\n\r\nAs it was explained to me, Voodoo/Vodun recognizes an idea of different classes of consciousness (or soul), which related to different levels or aspects of being: you exist, you are alive, you are conscious, etc. I think they just talk about four or so levels, but it seemed to me that they are just examples on a continuum of levels of organization.\r\n\r\n\"Animism\" is a general word for the belief that inanimate objects have (or may have) souls. This is complicated by the foregone conclusion that \"soul\" is only one thing (the idea of the indivisible point-like soul that exists in Judeo-Christian religion). True animism, therefore, probably consists of believing that these objects have complete, thinking minds, distinct from reality (because mind and soul are mixed up or bound together in Christian thinking).\r\n\r\nBreaking this assumption is the part I find interesting.\r\n\r\nSo in a broader sense, we could interpret animism as the belief that inanimate objects actually do have a \"perception\" (or \"self-awareness\" or \"soul\" -- all words for something we can't actually touch with process-oriented objective language, but I hope you understand the meaning I'm getting at). But we'd be stretching the meaning of the term as other people use it.\r\n"

    body: "\"Self-awareness\" is also an \"manmade imaginary concept\".\r\n\r\nSo is \"energy\". Yet, we can do rigorously accurate physics with it. The abstractness of an idea doesn't preclude its reality.\r\n\r\nYou are re-defining the word \"soul\" to take on a mechanistic meaning, which you then claim to be false (i.e. it's a \"strawman\"). I don't find that a compelling definition for the word, so I don't use it that way.\r\n\r\nBut as I said in the article, in the area of cognitive science, we have a whole array of words with confused mechanistic and perceptual meanings: \"self-awareness\", \"consciousness\", \"perception\", \"thought\", etc.\r\n\r\nFor example, from a functional perspective, the following Python program is \"self-aware\":\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\nprint \"I exist, and I am a python program.\"\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nSimilarly, in my opinion, the words \"consciousness\", \"perception\", and \"thought\" all have meaningful mechanistic definitions that we may talk about in a cognitive science or AI context (so long as we disabuse ourselves of the notion that we are talking about their perceptual meanings).\r\n\r\nI like confining the word \"soul\" to a perceptual meaning, rather than these other words, because, whereas all of the other words admit functional/mechanistic definitions, the word \"soul\" doesn't have one (or at least not a clear one). Also, \"soul\" has a clear religious/faith implication, and I like to emphasize that the belief in this perceptual reality (in others) is something totally unscientific that must be taken on faith. There is no objective way to prove the existence of \"souls\" (and by the same token, in their perceptual meanings, of \"self-awareness\", \"consciousness\", \"perception\", etc).\r\n\r\nIt's true of course, that people have for centuries tried to imagine a mechanistic / objective soul, but I consider that a case of sloppy thinking, rather than the definitional meaning of the word. Just because Hollywood depicts a \"soul\" as a swirly white thing in a jar, doesn't mean that's what we should imagine it to be (in fact we shouldn't imagine it to have any objective existence).\r\n\r\nWhen psychologists attempt to prove \"self-awareness\", all they are really proving is that the subject can respond to questions or make statements about itself. But as the example above shows, this doesn't really mean all that much (and of course, there are much more compelling AI systems).\r\n\r\nPhilosophers from time immemorial to the present have imagined that this idea -- this interface between objective and subjective reality -- is a <em>thing</em> of some kind, but I assert that it isn't. It's more absolute than that, and yet totally insubstantial. We're not talking about points on a graph here, we're talking about the axes that define the graph.\r\n"
