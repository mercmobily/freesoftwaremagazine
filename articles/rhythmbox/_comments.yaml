    body: "I switched from RhythmBox to Banshee, and haven't looked back. Its a much better player. I think you should give it a try.\r\n\r\n\"Rhythmbox is the closest to pinnacle of music player perfection that you’re likely to see for a while. Its got the perfect blend of ease-of-use for basic users and power for advanced users. There’s a reason it’s the default music player in Ubuntu.\"\r\n\r\nPinnacle? IMO, Amarok would deserve that title.\r\nAdvanced users? What power features does it have?\r\n\r\nThe only reason its the default is b/c there isn't any competition. Banshee, exaile, and others bring that. I'm hoping Banshee takes over as the default music player (long shot & wishful thinking)\r\n\r\nWhy would I want to launch another application to manage my iPod, when it makes perfect sense to do so from within the music player?\r\n\r\nIn fact, you can't even compare the two. Banshee wins hands down. I'm not bashing your post, just questioning your choice of words. \r\n\r\n"

    body: "Like so many other media player/library programmes, Rhythmbox is a pain in the backside when it comes to anything more complicated than the latest pop record.\r\n\r\nFor a lot of the music I listen to this is fine (mostly), but I also listen to Classical music and this is where the pain starts.\r\n\r\nAs examples (just for starters) Rhythmbox doesn't even support something as simple as the \"composer\" tag and there is no way of indicating parts of works."
