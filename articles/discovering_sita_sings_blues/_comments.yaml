    body: "Thanks for that sweet article. One correction: the vector source files are online:\r\nhttp://www.archive.org/details/Sita_Sings_the_Blues_Files\r\nI wish they were in a free format, rather than Flash. I'd love it if someone made some more easily-shareable vector files from them, but Flash doesn't export very well - stroke widths, alpha channels and tints get gunged up, and I used those a lot. But everything I have, you have, so others can tackle these problems while I move on to other work. Like the \"Understanding Free Content\" book/graphic novel/hard to describe thing I'm starting on.\r\n\r\nThanks again,\r\n\r\n--Nina\r\n\r\nhttp://www.sitasingstheblues.com/\r\nhttp://blog.ninapaley.com/\r\nhttp://questioncopyright.org/"
