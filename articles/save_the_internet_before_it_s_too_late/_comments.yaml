We cannot stop this process, it's impossible, but future you draw is quite unfeasible (luckily). \r\nInternet originate from free thought and it will be free as in freedom over and over again. Historically, Internet users are reluctant to pay and contents were free -- as is still now! I like think this will be forever.\r\nIn a perfect world, this first FCC's false move will be paid soon heading straight down toward the ground.\r\nOf course, let me dream ... :-)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nps: I'm studying English, be patient ... Please! ;-P"

    body: "The problem is that this enables ISP's to give some content providers much better bandwidth than others. It is not unlikely that for instance Microsoft enters a deal with some ISP's which enables the ISP's to use microsoft software for free (or cheap) and in return the ISP will give MS-applications better bandwith than it's competitors. If MS products would be perceived as faster by the end users the end users will most likely use the MS products, even if the speed advantage only is due to the ISP. In the battle between MS, Yahoo!, google and others this would be a huge advantage.\r\n\r\nIn addition small content providers will not be able to compete with larger content providers since they don't have the money to pay the ISP's for a better connection. This means that there will be no more YouTube-companies started \"from scratch\", which depend on good speed to stay competitive. \r\n\r\nEtc. etc.\r\n\r\nAnd in the end, this only results in end users paying more, ISP's getting fatter, content providers disappearing, no room for small content providers and companies, only the biggest survive, and the internet is not as free as it is today since one of the good things about the internet of today is its diversity and the fact that even the smalles have a voice."

    body: 'Pay pay pay pay pay. PAY. We already pay an ISP to access a network to enter onto the WWW, The cost of which is already stated in a multi-tiered system (Wide Open West or WOW) for example. Now the fat-cats have devised another scheme to ring more more from John/Jane Q. Public, all in the name of share holders and profits. The original internet was a tool used by scientist to share information between different countries during the cold war. Today it is the pulse of many communities from different countires. What starts in America, this new pay-as-you-go access, will spread like a cancer to other countires. Just when other countries are coming online, this cancer of greed spreads and kills the openness that today''s internet has been nurturing. Only the greedy haves will be able to access the net. The have-nots will continue to not-have. Where does the greed stop? Talk about terrorism. If this new law isn''t the new face of terrorism, extorsion, then what is? When do we stop paying just because someone else wants to extort more money?'
