Packt publishing is now organising the [2010 Open Source Awards](http://www.packtpub.com/open-source-awards-home). The winning projects will actually get a monetary prize (which I am sure will be most welcome).

I am always a little skeptical of these awards. However, I have to say that Packt really have proved themselves here: they started with the Open Source CMS Award a few years back, and they have now expanded it to several different categories.

Go and check out their web site, and make sure you nominate the projects you think should win!
