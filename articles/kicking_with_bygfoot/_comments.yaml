    body: "This looks good. \r\n\r\nWhy does it not have real player names? I know there is the issue of trademark disputes , but it used to be ok for championship manager. It wasn't a infringement as they were not having a graphical representation of the players which the trademark covered. i.e. The trade mark didn't cover text. So writing 'Steven Gerrard' was never a problem. "

    body: "The official team names are missing as well. So (for the English premiership) you get to choose from the likes of \"Manchester\" and \"Manchester C.\" instead of Manchester United and Mancheser City. Most teams are recognisable from their home city and some from a district (so Chelsea and Tottenham - but not Tottenham Hotspur).\r\nIt looks like Arsenal have become \"London\" - which differs from commericial games like Pro Evolution Soccer which (not having a licence) uses North London and North East London for Tottenham.\r\n\r\nAFAIK a lot of the players have trademarked their names in relation to football products. Certainly there was a question at some point with distribution (by Linux distro's) of the package including copyrighted names.\r\n\r\nhttp://bygfoot.sourceforge.net/extras.html tells you how to download the full names separately."
