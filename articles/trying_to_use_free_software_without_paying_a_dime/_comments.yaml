But doesn't digiKam (or some other photo album software) allow for an export into a complete HTML/CSS gallery? i mean, it just creates a folder.. Then you could host it on your shared server without needing PHP/MySQL.\r\n\r\nI shortly used JAlbum in that way a long time ago. There are a lot of nice CSS-skins for it, however it is only free as in free beer... but probably there are similar, free, alternatives.."

We tried running gallery2 on a p350 with 256Mb of RAM, but it ran into swap. If you're at college, make friends with the IT dept, as in all likelihood they'll regularly decommission older machines, and may have memory spare for free, or at most beer money.\r\nThe wireless device should be fast enough to serve content at an acceptable rate.\r\nThen you need to set up port forwarding for port 80 on your router, so any web requests at your router's IP get handled by your server.\r\nIt's a good opportunity to learn a lot along the way :)\r\n\r\nD"

    body: "You are absolutely right.  However, the problem with exporting an HTML/CSS gallery is that then you have create a homepage with the same theme and then manually link to the gallery.  Besides, with more advanced gallery software, you can do things like comment, or rate, something HTML/CSS just can't do.  However, if you didn't want to use Flickr, and needed to host it yourself, this could be another good way.\r\n\r\n--\r\nAndrew Min"

If you have less than 256 Kbps on upstream, forget about it - especially for a site with Content.\r\n---\r\nA computer is like air conditioning: it becomes useless when you open windows."

    body: "I has similar problems a while ago when my girlfriend wanted to build pages for herself. \r\n\r\nFortunately I had 100 Mb of space hosted by a certain magazine. The problem was that the webspace had only PHP-support. I didn't even bother to search any free PHP-galleries, but wrote one simple myself. Of course it wasn't anything fancy; It just loaded picture thumbnails from a directory and the pictures from other, arranged them to a gallery and read the picture title and explanation from a separate file. The gallery's looks were defined by separate html/css -files. \r\n\r\nSimilar approach might fit to you too if you can find free php somewhere (might be easier than php+mysql)."

About a year ago i set up an account with them and deposited US$20. Since that time, I have registered a domain and hosted several hobby sites with them, and I still have about a 1/4 of my initial deposit with them. I''m not saying that their service is right for everyone, but you might want to check it out.'

You could set up a free WP blog with wordpress.com or install WP on one of the free hosts that you outlined. Then link to your Flickr (or whatever) hosted photos. If you wanted to get more advanced there are plenty of photo gallery plugins for WP. WP will allow your visitors to comment on the photos, yourself to provide text descriptions of the photos, & there are plenty of really good looking themes...\r\nI hope this helps."
