    body: "There is no real roadmap that I've seen, per se, but there are plans for WiFi in the next revision or two. The \"more memory\" is a frequent request, as well, so as memory prices fall, I'm sure they will stuff more and more into it.\r\n\r\nThat is assumptions I'm making based on messages I've read on the developers' list, so I can't be sure I'm correct.\r\n"

    body: "The Neo1973 will be \"unlocked.\" That is, it is a GSM phone, but it is not tied to any one carrier. So, any GSM provider will work. In the US, I know T-Mobile is a GSM carrier. There may be others.\r\n\r\nMost cell providers in the US subsidize the cost of the phone by requiring a contract. You will most likely have to sign a contract, and you will probably get a cheap cell phone with the contract. But, simply take the SIM out of the cell phone they give you, and place it in the Neo1973.\r\n\r\nI'm really excited about this phone. General sales start March 11."
