Why don't people switch to GNU/Linux? It's not the difficulty (GNU/Linux has evolved far past its Bash days, although it still stays true to its roots). It's not the stability (GNU/Linux' stability is far superior to Windows'). It's not the security (ditto the stability). It's the applications. People feel like they can't do things in Windows that they can in GNU/Linux. They can. But they don't know it. This book was written to correct that illogical thinking.
