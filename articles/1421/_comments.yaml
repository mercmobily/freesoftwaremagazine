    body: " \r\n<strong>Comment from: A Reader [Visitor]</strong>\r\n\r\n    2005-11-16 @ 08:20\r\n    To charactarise copying as \"theft\" is a gross over-simplification. The term, along with \"piracy\" is best avoided because it's too often used by the music, movie and computer industries as a form of propaganda to push people into accepting draconion controls. For example, DVDs that neatly carve up the world into regions - this is not copy protection.\r\n\r\n    Any harm done by copying is a far more complicated issue than stealing; also, even if it's wrong to copy in some circumstances, that doesn't mean it's stealing. There are plenty of things that you shouldn't do, which possibly deprive someone else of an opportunity or cause financial loss, but we don't call it stealing.\r\n\r\n    If you want to punt inaccurate terms around, you could say the music industry are guilty of simple theft when they engage in price fixing, or when they put DRM on your computer (it costs money for companies to remove it). But then, if you call everything theft, we won't know what you're talking about.\r\n\r\n    The corporates that represent Mickey Mouse and Madonna have a monopoly on icons of popular culture. You can't just decide to buy some other competing artist if you've been exposed to, and liked, the latest Madonna hit. Nor would many parents insist that their kids avoid Mickey Mouse on the grounds that Disney have over-extended their reach on copyright.\r\n\r\n    Copyright holders have an obligation not to abuse their monopoly position, and this is far more important than stopping a few freeloaders, who have a finite pool of money to spend on DVDs, games, music etc. and therefore won't spend any more on these items just because of some copyinig restrictions.\r\n\r\n    Bottom line, there's always ways to make money so all this greed and calling copying \"theft\" is just unnecessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>Comment from: A Reader [Visitor]</strong>\r\n\r\n    2005-11-16 @ 08:27\r\n    Sorry, forgot to include in the above:\r\n\r\n    Spammers - why don't we just call them thieves too!\r\n\r\n    Finally (really!) if anyone is in doubt about whether copying is as bad as theft, just look at social attitudes.\r\n\r\n    How many adults can you get to admit to stealing something? Maybe a few embarrassed confessions about childhood, but unless you talk to criminals you're not going to find many adults who steal things.\r\n\r\n    Now go asking about copying. Sure, some people may be uncomfortable with it, but most people 'off the record' will happily admit to copying CDs, or having done so in the recent past.\r\n\r\n    Let's not try to change society's attitudes just to suit a few greedy monopolists.\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>Comment from: Rui Miguel Silva Seabra [Visitor]</strong>\r\n\r\n    2005-11-16 @ 08:35\r\n    Absurd basis leads to absurd conclusions.\r\n\r\n    The moment you assume copyright is some kind of property, you immediately start from false assumptions. The pitfall of that absurd logic is conclusions like: DRM is good in principle, unauthorized copying is theft, etc...\r\n\r\n    DRM is mutually exclusive with Free Software. If there's Free Software that can play the content 1 time only, it can be trivially changed to DUMP the content and then replayed any number of times.\r\n\r\n    The only sollution is to legally remove the freedom of modification by law, so that people couldn't do that. If people can't do that, than it's no longer Free Software.\r\n\r\n    Your conclusions are absurd, therefore, and prove that you have much confusion to clear up.\r\n\r\n    For instance, a technical conclusion: encryption technologies... Yes, it's encrypted, but no Free Software tool that leads with encryption allows you to only decrypt once, or on mondays, or phones home to tell some corporate lawyer what music you're playing.\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>Comment from: Jim O'Flaherty [Visitor]</strong>\r\n\r\n    2005-11-16 @ 17:16\r\n    Edward, Copying a piece of copyrighted material, regardless of source and/or destination forms of the material, is NEVER theft. It can only be copyright infringement. Lawmakers were very careful to distinguish between physical property (which by it's nature is scarce) and idea property (which by it's nature is not scarce). Theft implies the \"owner\" lost some value not regained. Infringement implies the \"owner\" did not receive his government granted monopoly rent. While subtle, forming this distinction is critical when discussing the values and choices around \"idea ownership and control\" - which copyright attempts to grant in a limited fashion.\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>Comment from: Rufus Polson [Visitor]</strong>\r\n\r\n    2005-11-17 @ 16:54\r\n    It seems to me some of this nonsense is itself illegal. It's all very fine to start from the position that copying by definition is an infringement of copyright, except that it's utterly false. My understanding is that in fact buyers of copyrighted material have certain rights of their own, certainly in the US but in many other countries as well.\r\n    So for instance, if I buy a book I have the right to resell that same book, and certainly to lend it to a friend. The *book* is mine; copyright just stops me from publishing it. So any Microsoft EULA which purports to say I can't do that with *my* computer game which I bought is illegal, and any copy-protection scheme which stops me from selling it, lending it, or for that matter loading it onto my new computer after I got rid of the previous one, is on very questionable legal ground.\r\n    Furthermore, it's been established in court that people have the right to make copies of music they buy for their personal use. If I bought a CD, I have the right to make a party tape using some of the songs on it, or rip it to MP3 and stuff its contents on my ipod or whatever. Again, DRM infringes on my rights to do that kind of stuff and is itself legally questionable, although in the US the odious Digital Millennium Copyright Act lends this sort of thing cover.\r\n\r\n    We have a tendency to think that the rich and powerful become respectable and their actions must be assumed to be legal just because of the fact of their wealth. But many of them aren't respectable, and corporate charters mean they have to pursue profits at the expense of any and all other values, potentially including legality. Maybe we should be enforcing the legality of corporate behaviour before we worry too much about the activities of thousands of people who don't so far seem to have put much of a bite into their profits.\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>Comment from: Karl Fogel [Visitor] Ã‚Â· http://www.copyrightmyths.org/</strong>\r\n\r\n    2005-11-18 @ 21:51\r\n    Some of the assumptions in this article, about what copyright is for and exactly what \"rights\" people should have to restrict access to works of the mind, deserve closer scrutiny. The publishing industry has worked very hard for three hundred years to convince everyone that some people should have a \"right\" to restrict the spread of copyable works Ã¢â‚¬â€? that to support these rights is \"reasonable\", and that to object to them is automatically \"unreasonable\".\r\n\r\n    Not all of us agree with those assumptions. The web site above, http://www.copyrightmyths.org/, is a start at explaining why.\r\n"
