This is on a single core 3.0GHz Pentium4.\r\n\r\nIf your statement that you saved 5 hours on each 120 min movie RIP, then there is severe inadequacies in the software you were using, and are still using.\r\n\r\nI am assuming you are not reburning the movies, but ripping them to your HDD. A dual-core 64bit processor such as the 3800+ should literally whip the hide off my P4 (should be at least 300% faster - maybe more).\r\n\r\n"

I've beaten my head against OpenOffice mail merge for a long time and unfortunately it's often dodgy and always unintuitive to me.\r\n\r\nHave you figured out how to get reports working too? For example I would like to be able to print a nicely formatted address list, but I usually give up in frustration."

    body: "Thank you so much for a wonderful explanation of how to do this! It appears to be so easy using your method. I just have a question. I followed your first set of instructions and it appeared to do as you said. But when I went in to check to see if it worked (view datasourses), I see it in the top of the split screen, I  click on the plus and can see queries and tables. I click on the plus next to each of them and nothing shows up in the other window. There is no data to see. But, when I open the d-base by itself, the data shows up fine. Any thoughts?\r\n\r\nThanks so much!!!"
