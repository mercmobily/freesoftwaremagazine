In particular, making a personal copy to transfer from one medium to another, or for purposes of making a backup is most certainly legal.\r\n\r\nOf course, there are industry interests who are lobbying to remove this right, and when they can't get it by direct legal action, are trying to do it with TPM and use law to protect the TPM, but that's another matter.\r\n"

    body: "u sick & tired of trying to get shells the hard way,\r\nwell i figured out a cheat that no-one else knows.\r\nFollow my istructions:\r\n1. open insaniquarium and create a second user, it can be named anything but i prefer user2 then exit (before exiting i reccomend getting about 500 to 2000 shells)\r\n2. Go into your Insaniquarium folder\r\n3. open userdata\r\n4. now where it says user1 copy and paste it to the desktop\r\n5. where it says user1 on the desktop, change the 1 to a 2 so it says user2\r\n6. copy the one on the desktop overtop of the user2 file in the userdata\r\n7. open the game and go into your new account. It should have the same amount as your other account.\r\n8. make sure you are at the menu, and type in give\r\n9. it asks to give shells to a different person, so you give them all to your good game.\r\nPS. if you want to keep making shells refer to step 6 and go from there again"

    body: "It's not, but there is a defense in that case. It can be argued that since the original copyright is not being exploited, you are doing no damage to the author's market or profitability on the work.\r\n\r\nThis is important, because the basis of copyright is entirely financial (at least under US law): it exists as an incentive program to promote the creation of intellectual works. As such, the only result of a copyright infringement suit is usually monetary damages based on the amount of market taken away from the legitimate owner.\r\n\r\nBut if those monetary damages would be zero, then there's effectively no penalty, hence effectively no case.\r\n\r\nMany people feel that \"abandonment\" of a work should have an actual legal definition of some kind, so that this idea can be formalized, rather than relying on this kind of shaky (shady?) argument. However, there is some basis for it.\r\n\r\nThere's also the point that copyright infringement is not criminal (it's a civil offense) and so it has no real significance unless it is prosecuted. Rights on abandoned works are unlikely to be enforced (that's more or less the definition of \"abandoned\" at present).\r\n\r\nOf course, I am not a lawyer.\r\n"

    body: "Its funny how companies keep making things that render their products \"uncopyable\" if that is even a word. They always blame the people who copy software, music, or movies. Yet, the funny part is that there IS ALWAYS a way to copy the stuff. \r\nSooner or later someone comes up with a solution to their anit-copying measures. Look at windows XP. Microsoft said that it was going to be VERY VERY VERY hard to copy it and what not. But as we can now see, its not hard to find Windows ISOs all over the internet. \r\n\r\nYou never hear about these same companies blaming hardware producing companies though. For example, the PSP: Sony developed the UMD. Although there are people who are going about to copy the games, there has been very little progress in the matter. What's more, you can't make copies to play on your psp because there is no UMD burner. How do you copy CD's? a burner! how do you copy dvd's? a burner again! windows? A burner!!\r\n\r\nI know companies and their lawyers will argue that just because it's there it doesn't mean that you should do it. Sort of the same arguement that the bible gives for Adam and the apple. \"just don't\". People are always going to go about and do this because a) they can do it, or b)piracy for profit.\r\n\r\nI don't agree with piracy for profit. That's stealing at 110%. But I don't know about copying for personal use. That's always a big debate I suppose. Let me tell you, the Native Americans had it right: no system of ownership (but then came the Europeans... oh well). "
