    body: 'I liked just reading this article even though the terms were a little confusing because I am not that into computers, but with me wanting to start my own Christian magazine for African American young people to uplift, inspire,and ignite change in their lives through self-empowerment, I glad to hear that someone else made their dreams come true as well. I have had this vision for a long time, even been over my choir newsletter on campus,and running a magazine is my ideal job. It will be my avenue to establish other things like a teen center, youung adult cafe, and a public speaking motivational traveling group. I am starting from scratch with just prayer and determination, but I know with God all things are possible. Thanks for your article. If you have any other advice to give me, please feel free to contact me via email at jeneladonna@yahoo.com. '
