    body: "...I also know that almost nothing that is said in the article would relate with the experience under Windows. In fact, GNOME doesn't run under Windows (Windows doesn't support alternate window managers) - so, I'm adding this sentence to those people who read too fast or don't really understand what's written.\r\n\r\nIt is also an ironic statement: who would actually obey that?\r\n\r\nYou may want to check your vocabulary and grammar: in English, it's \"paranoid\"; then, \"it's not good for\"; and last, it's \"noticing (something)'s existence\".\r\n---\r\nA computer is like air conditioning: it becomes useless when you open windows."
