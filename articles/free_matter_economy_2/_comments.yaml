Designed as cheap car for Hitler's masses, ordered by NSDAP == National Socialist Deutsche (=German) Arbeit (=worker's) == Nazi Party. See wikipedia for \"NSDAP\" and \"VW_Beetle\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo it was not completely accident, IMHO. Article says: \"Deliberately designed to be as simple as possible mechanically\". BTW air-cooled engine design (and others)  stolen from Czech \"Tatra\" cars. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr/>\r\n\r\n<strong>From</strong>: Dissent \r\n<strong>Url</strong>: http://www.virtualdissent.com\r\n<strong>Date</strong>: 2005-11-28\r\n<strong>Subject:</strong> Virtual Dissent\r\n\r\n\r\nlol, nevermind...\r\n\r\n<hr/>\r\n\r\n"
