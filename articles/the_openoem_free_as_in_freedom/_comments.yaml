    body: "DMCA only protects copyright protecting TPMs.\r\n\r\nIf you can produce an HD-DVD then with you being the copyright owner of your own work, you can disable, decrypt, or circumvent whatever TPMs your computer may retain. You cannot get prosecuted for fixing your machine to display your own work at the resolution it is capable of.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the challenge is first to create your own HD-DVD.\r\n\r\nIf you then released it copyleft everyone else would then be free to fix their own machines because they have your license to full access of your copyrighted work."

Open Cell Phone , Open Router , Open HouseHold Solar Generator, etc... the start of a Digital Renaissance.  Download and print out electronics devices with a 3D printer/fabrication device...\r\n\r\nFab@home and MIT's FabLab are on the way to this.  I cant wait for these devices to help projects like this really become a reality.  \r\n\r\nPutting innovation 100% back into individuals hands, I wholeheartedly agree that business by design does not innovate and progress, and I look forward to the time when individuals once again have control of ideas and their implementations only this time in a networked world."

    body: "The last few years has seen a major software company ranting & raving about \"Innovation.\"\r\n\r\nThat same company licenses [sells?] software that can be extremely difficult to diagnose & repair in even relatively minor problems because the process(es) are usually hidden from the licensed operator/user of the software.\r\n\r\nOddly enough, that company has often used the word 'transparent' to describe the 'ease' w/ which the operator/user can accomplish their desired activities w/ that company's various soft/hard-ware products.\r\n\r\nObviously, the open-source solution can provide a new paradigm even for solving the inevitable problems that complicated software/hardware devices [i.e., computers & others] will continue to exhibit.\r\n\r\nI commend your goal of reducing [eliminating?] the unduly restrictive & hidden handicaps that some proprietary hardware & its attendant designs place on the legitimate use of equipment, tools, & hardware that was paid for & therefor entitles that 'payer,' user, or owner to, in the fullest sense of the word, the USE of what they've paid for [bought?].\r\n\r\nIn the final analysis, the ongoing trends to deliberately handicap the legitimate use of hardware constitutes deliberate attempts to deprive people of their property rights.\r\n\r\nAs long as the present system of governance exists, the rights of property owners will, to some degree, be in conflict w/ the rights of some copyright holders.\r\n\r\nIf those copyright holders wish to limit the use of their products, certainly that is within their rights to do so.\r\n\r\nIt is NOT within their rights to attempt to limit my legitimate use of property, i.e., hardware, that does not belong to them.  In short, yours, mine, & ours.\r\n\r\nIn addition to open source hardware, maybe its time to consider eliminating even the use of such standards as CD-ROMs for copyrighted material.  As long as the 'copyrights' holders can claim that their use of such standards is legal, they will continue to attempt the illegitimate restrictions of such standards for their own profit, at the expense of others.\r\n\r\nHopefully, these ideas will prompt more discussion.\r\n\r\nJonS\r\n\r\n"

    body: "I've thought lots about things like this recently, and I was very happy when I was told on the Free Software Foundation Associate Member Forum about this project. It's certainly needed.\r\n\r\nIs there any hardware already existing that conforms to this idea of free hardware, or does this project face the tedious task of building everything from the ground up?\r\n\r\nI hope this project is successful, and that truly open computers can be made available around the world. Once we can offer a computer which has no compatibility issues with free software, and which anyone has the right to study/use/modify, freedom will have been greatly furthered and DRM will hang by a thread (albeit a strong thread, since consumers will still be forced to use patent-infested hardware to play such things as music and movies, which I doubt the big companies will release under in a free format).\r\n\r\nI commend this project, and hope I can be useful! I'm now going to look at the forums.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://markdarb.googlepages.com\">Mark William Darbyshire</a>"
