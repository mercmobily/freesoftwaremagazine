    body: "In business, timing is everything. When RedHat started Fedora, there was no immediate revenue stream possible from the desktop. Look at Caldera! They had a very smooth distro and changed course. Thank goodness, RedHat had more sense. They did, in a way, abandon the desktop, but they have used Fedora as a testbed to keep their iron hot, and they have done good work with K12LTSP to make one of the smoothest GNU/Linux distros specialized for schools. That has planted seeds. Many students will have experienced GNU/Linux in schools thanks to RedHat. Many businesses will have experienced the reliability of GNU/Linux through RedHat on the server. RedHat has the ability to grow onto the desktop by several avenues: influences in education and widespread acceptance of GNU/Linux in business ( see http://www.redhat.com/rhel/details/clients/ ).\r\n\r\nRedHat is in it for the long haul and I would not count them out so quickly. They are huge in America and in a few other parts of the planet, such as India.\r\n\r\nUbuntu definitely has mindshare among the passionate and soon-to-be-passionate GNU/Linux lovers, and it is a more global movement. Mark Shuttleworth has definitely earned a big return in passion for a relatively small investment and the time is right to catch the wave.\r\n\r\nI am still convinced that RedHat can also catch the wave. Migrations/new installations are going to Linux at such a rate that there will be room for several profitable/widespread distros.\r\n---\r\n\r\nA problem is an opportunity."

It didn't and in fact Solaris is experiencing a bit of a resurgance in use at the moment.\r\n\r\nI realise the situation isn't quite the same.  Firstly Sun had a high end hardware market which kept Solaris alive in the lean times.  Secondly there isn't really a lot of room in the market for profitable Linux distributions.  Thirdly its easier to switch between Linux distributions than it was for people to switch from Solaris to Linux.  But Redhat has a lot of mindshare in the Enterprise markets and it'll take quite a while for Ubuntu to challenge that.\r\n\r\n---\r\nPhillip Fayers\r\nhttp://phillipfayers.blogspot.com/"

    body: "I don't know if I would be so bold as to predict the demise of Red Hat, but Ubuntu is certainly going to give them a run for the money. Ubuntu has started out much more in tune with the philosophy of free software, and that gives them a strong lead with their core market. People will be passionate about Ubuntu in ways that people usually aren't about Red Hat.\r\n\r\nWhen I started working with GNU/Linux, I did from a \"principles first\" approach. I read Richard Stallman's \"Gnu Manifesto\" and his announcement of the GNU project, and I became very interested in the theory of free software development and what it was capable of. I'm a skeptical reader, though, and I don't really believe things like this until I see them work. On the other hand, I don't discount them, either.\r\n\r\nSo my immediate inclination was to go full steam ahead with the idea and see just how strong an idea it was. So, instead of going with Red Hat, which was a kind of amphibious, proprietary/free creature at the time, I went with Debian, because it was a full community-driven \"for users, by users\" distribution, and the whole mechanism was under free licenses. I figured I didn't want to get behind the idea until I had proven to myself that it wasn't just fairy gold.\r\n\r\nThe going was incredibly hard at first -- but I expected that. I knew, first of all, that ANY such total switch in operating system was going to hurt. I knew that because I'd already switched from TRS-80 to IBM to Mac to BSD Unix to Solaris to MS-DOS to Windows 3.1 (variously at home, work, and school), and had even tried Win 95 on a new job. Also, I knew Debian was an all-volunteer project, and I've been a member of enough of those (Boy Scouts, National Space Society, Planetary Society, even Junior Achievement, a couple of PTAs, and church groups) to know what that's like.\r\n\r\nWhat I was surprised by, though, was not the little foibles when compared with full-blown corporate enterprises, but rather the fact that you <em>could</em> compare it with <em>full-blown corporate enterprises</em>! Clearly the free software method <em>worked</em>. So when I first heard of Ubuntu trying to create a more end-user-desktopÃ¢â‚¬â€œandÃ¢â‚¬â€œcorporateÃ¢â‚¬â€œfriendly distribution built on Debian, I had a strong feeling that I was going to like it from the start.\r\n\r\nUbuntu has taken that wisdom and added the right amount of corporate backing in a very savvy way. Shuttleworth has avoided spoiling the process (a tricky thing to do!), and he's got momentum. Most commercial GNU/Linux companies seem to have a lot of conflict between \"community\" and \"business\" goals, but Ubuntu seems to know how to cut with the grain so that the \"community\" and \"business\" goals are the same.\r\n\r\nOf course, for a space junkie like me, it can't possibly hurt that the founder is one of the world's first space tourists!\r\n\r\nIn any case, Ubuntu is the first commercial GNU/Linux distribution to seriously tempt me away from mainline Debian.\r\n"

Or at least I used to, I'm getting spoiled to merely 5-yr-old equipment lately).\r\n\r\nSeriously, though, Ubuntu is looking to become stiff competition and Red Hat is going to have to make changes if it wants to stay in the game, let alone on top.\r\n\r\nOne thing of course that Red Hat <em>does</em> have is more than six years of existence -- that six year policy would be more convincing coming from a company that had been around longer than Canonical has.  As conservative as corporate buyers are, that's going to matter quite a bit.\r\n\r\n"

That key reason was that Microsoft conquered IBM from the desktop, not from the server room or the board room. Little guys everywhere were using Windows for Workgroups to get stuff done without the red tape and resistance they got from the centralized IT department. They took risks and simply ignored corporate policy. It was evolution in action. Darwin (had he been a hacker) would have been proud.\r\n\r\nI thought SUSE was going to win the battle with Red Hat, and so I wrote, \"If the desktop OS comes in a green box, the server OS will come in a green box.\" I was wrong about SUSE; it looks like the box will be brown.\r\n\r\n"

And finally, they have no clear focus : they seemed to be a desktop-oriented distro and all of a sudden they created a server version and released it with Long Time Support although it was the first version. The same is true for their Live-cd installer and there has been many reports on the Net that it is buggy.\r\n\r\nSo, all in all, I don't think they're doing themselves good advertisement with their latest distribution."

Some commentators on Ubuntu complain about the standard repositories, but that does not matter to me:  for me, the relevant datum is the fact that I have yet to find a major Linux software package for which someone has not made a good, reliable, and functional Ubuntu .deb.  Under most Linuxes I have tried, I have to consider using outdated rpms with prayer; under Ubuntu, I look far more for the best repository for the package I want, than I do for the proper .deb.  This is the best possible way, I think: the Ubuntu community includes a very careful subcommunity of package repositories, which is different and, I suggest, flatly better than any other Linux.\r\n\r\nAnd for less-than-major packages, I have yet to find a current .deb or binary installer I cannot load using Ubuntu.  As long as I have reliable software to load, I'm happy, and the .deb system has been tremendously better in my experience than the rpm system.  I used the rpm system on and off for years, in more than one distro including a few versions from RedHat, and had to regularly get in and fix its own damages.  When the rpm system first came out, it looked like it should work wonderfully...but bugs crept in which they never worked out, and today, if I load an rpm into a Linux, I have to wonder how much manual munging of the result I am going to have to do, almost exactly like the Slackware .tgz I started out in.  I have yet to have this problem with the .deb system.\r\n"

As individual, hobbyist users, we're unlikely to blow money on that, but it all translates to money for a company: whether it's money paid to an inside expert or contracted to an outside one, it all comes off the balance sheet. Ubuntu, like Red Hat, and SUSE (and MEPIS and Mandriva and many, many others) basically make money by being that line item.\r\n\r\nIn a way, of course, you're a \"free rider\", but in reality you're more like \"advertising\", as well as \"quality control\".  Individual users test a distribution and they help it gain mindshare -- both contribute to the products success in the business environment where success is easier to monetize.\r\n\r\nYou can of course, try to get a similar win from individual desktop users, which tends to be the point of \"package\" distributions like MEPIS and some early versions of Red Hat.

After abandoning\r\nSuSE and their confusing sysconfig system, I obtained a copy of Ubuntu 5 from a regular\r\ncustomer at the coffee-bean slingery which signed my checks at the time.\r\n\r\nI will say that the install was cake. Pleasantly, I found that it did not take a lot\r\nof time. If you've used SuSE you know you can grow a beard before it installs. I liked\r\nthe desktop and thought it was clean. Then I tried to tweak it to my personal needs.\r\n\r\nNothing was there! No video, properly working firefox, missing perl mods, missing dev\r\nlibraries! It seemed that I couldn't find/understand things that I used to be able to\r\nhandle just by screwing with /etc. But, it's got repositories, so all of the files are\r\nthere, right? Sure, but when I wanted to play with them, I couldn't find them. When I\r\ndownloaded .deb packages, I couldn't figure out how to get them to work. When I tried to\r\nconvert .rpm to .deb, all hell broke loose. Enough was enough.\r\n\r\nWith Fedora 5, I did have to do some tweaking to set up the box, but when yum does an\r\ninstall, also from those wonderful repos, I know where the executables are and where\r\nthe config files are. They were quite easy to find. When I compile from source, I don't\r\nget errors. I can script, surf, listen to music, watch movies, create documents, run\r\na test server, the whole bit.\r\n\r\nIt's nice to feel like I have control over the box, which is why I switched away from\r\nwindows in the first place. Ubuntu may be great for someone that is used to working with\r\ndebian, but for an rpm guy, it doesn't make a lot of sense. The end all would be a \r\ndeb/rpm hybrid system, where the configuration is not some wacky, new idea."

So the bottom line is, does it cost MORE, or does it cost LESS?\r\n\r\nAnonymous coward:  Yes, a \"new\" laptop, but did you try it on an older one? And your dad won't call you if he had Windoze, instead?\r\n\r\ndsas:  You mentioned Win98 & its 'longterm support'; but how much did it cost to license 250 seats (or more) w/ that, compared to a Linux flavor?\r\n\r\n  & as for Redhat, its in the game to stay, but so is Microsoft, & its not even in the same league anymore, IMHO.\r\n\r\n  No, this isn't about the 'demise' of Redhat, or about one of the other Linuxes, although some may pine for one of them.\r\n\r\n  What we're talking about is what a lot Linux aficionados have been looking forward to for quite some time;  Linux, of <EM>any</EM> variety, is finally getting some real traction where it counts, in the corporate world.  All those Linux desktops DO make a difference.\r\n\r\n  You like Ubuntu, or SUSE, or Debian, Redhat, that's fine.  Right now, there's a way to go, but time will shake out one or two that will raise above the others, whether its the best or not.\r\n (Personally, I still think OS/2 was better than Windoze.)\r\n\r\n  But the point is that 'open source,' of some kind, is in the hunt.  Some of you don't think that 'corporate' will switch, but compare software (IT) w/ personnel; If they'll 'dump' the old hands to save money up front, how long before they figure they can swap out software the same way?\r\n\r\n  Sooner or later, Ubuntu, Redhat, or maybe one of the others IS going to go big at one of the big names in business.  Everyone else will be watching, & if it looks like that business is doing good w/ Linux, others will follow.\r\n\r\n  In that regard, the Linux version will matter less than how well that 'early adopter' does in the marketplace, where success is dependent on the winds of fortune & fate as much as anything else.\r\n\r\n  Just an opinion.

    body: "I wanted to learn/use Linux 6 years ago when I started a small web-consulting business.  I had precious little resources and did not want to spend them on licensing fees for operating systems, database servers, development tools, etc, etc.  I paid $800 to build a robust (enough) server and $15 for 6 cd's of Red Hat 5.5, I think it was???  Wow!  What a great price to get up and going!  I soon got frustrated after several attempts to install/configure and gave up to go back to Microsoft.  What I could not afford most of all was the time I was pouring into this!  Ok, a few years later I got the urge to try Linux again.  A co-worker (I went back to a corporate IT department) gave me a copy of Ubuntu.  Funny name, pictures of half-naked people on the cd-sleeve... what the hell was this?  He told me to just install it and see if I like it (4.10 - Warty Warthog <who comes up with these names???>).  He also told me of a FANTASTIC site that every Ubuntu newbie needs to visit - ubuntuguide.org.  Anyway, I got it installed and IT JUST WORKED!  (To be fair, I imagine that the newer Linux distros have similiar \"ease of install\" features.)  Anyway, Ubuntu made me a Linux convert! I now have 3 servers, 2 desktops and 1 laptop running 6.06 Dapper Drake.\r\n\r\nOk, the real reason I prefer Ubuntu.....\r\n\r\nAt work we have 2 RHEL 9 boxes.  I am admin on them.  When I try to install some software to evaluate (document mgmt system, BPM Suite, CRM app, etc.) I inevitably have to install/upgrade packages like MySql, PHP, Perl, etc.  I kept getting dependency issues with the RPMs.  It took several extra hours tracking down misc packages to satisfy these dependencies.  In a way I liked it, it honed my Linux sys admin skills, but my boss doesn't like the extra time it takes to accomplish this.  Let me say this, we are a mixed shop and always will be - Windows and Linux.  I prefer it this way.  It keeps me current on more skills and more marketable.  Anyway, I decided to spend some company money and take some Linux classes.  The only thing that my company would pay for was SUSE.  Red Hat training was more expensive.  Anyway I took some SLES training and saw the future and the future was YAST!!!  Ok, YAST was cool, but I soon ran into problems with it as well.  I set up a SLEH box at work and had some YAST problems.  The system hung up sometimes while doing updates.  I could not get sound to work (this is not a big deal for a server, but it is for a desktop).  Anyway, at home I ALWAYS had Ubuntu working and was becoming more proficient with it.  By this time I had a desktop and a server with Ubuntu serving up a few websites and CMS sites for outside consulting work.\r\n\r\nI just set up an Ubuntu box here at work to test out an open-source DMS called Knowledge Tree DMS and it is working beautifully.\r\n\r\nI currently use RHEL 9 and Ubuntu 6.06.  I must say that I prefer Ubuntu because of it ease and simplicity.  I like the fact that it is installed from 1 cd and I can apt-get repositories from the web for updates.  I like apt-get vs. rpm and I think that is the main reason people will like Ubuntu vs. RedHat.  Don't get me wrong, Red Hat isn't going away, just like Windows is not going away.  I work for a VERY large govt agency (20,000+ users) and we will AlWAYS have a healthy mixture of Microsoft and Open-source solutions.  I am very proud and extremely excited that we are investigating more and more uses for open-source software.  We are in the process of selecting an OSS desktop to start experimenting with and see if we can, not phase-out Windows but phase-in open-source software.  As US-taxpayers we should all be happy that our Govt is exploring ways to cut back on licensing fees paid to any one vendor.  This is not only going on in Europe, Asia, Africa, but here as well.\r\n\r\nCan you tell I like the word anyway?"

If a hardware manufacturer will only support Linux -- at least for now -- with a closed-source driver, so be it.  At least they are supporting Linux, in a world that is still so dominated by Windows that Linux could be easily ignored.  Same thing for application software.  If a company wants to sell a closed-source product to protect trade secrets, and the product does the job for me and is well-supported, I'm not going to rule it out on philosophical grounds.\r\n\r\nSo, for me, a distribution that offers both free and non-free packages is a plus; it allows me the freedom to choose the best of both worlds.\r\n"

She now is passing out the CDs in their nifty covers to friends at work who may or may not play with them.\r\n\r\nI know, a little off topic, and the reason the masses may come to use ubuntu is that most of us can drop in the CD and it works  -  can't say that for most of the distros I have tried.  Better than Red Hat? - Can't say definatively - I'm not a professional.  Ubuntu just works everytime I have exposed someone to the wonders of linux - I know I'll get flamed if I start espousing the free CDs and the slick packaging, its just that I can't tell you how many people seriously consider trying linux because some how MS ( see how it works .. ) gave it away for free in a nifty package that even my partner can praise.\r\n\r\nThanks Linus and Richard and Mark and Tony and yes You for making the world a little more fun \r\n\r\n"
