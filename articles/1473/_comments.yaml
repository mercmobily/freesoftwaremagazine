Here is a description of MIME:\r\n\r\n    \"MIME-type\r\n    A way to describe the kind of document being transmitted. Its name comes from that fact that its format is borrowed from the Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions. It consists of a major type and a minor type, separated by a slash. Some examples are text/html, image/gif, and application/octet-stream. In HTTP, the MIME-type is transmitted in the Content-Type header.\"\r\n\r\n    Ogg files are described as application/ogg since 2003, see http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3534.txt\r\n\r\n    If your techs use Apache 1.3.x, then the file mime.types needs updating, usually found in the conf directory.\r\n\r\n    If they use Apache 2.x.x, then have them consult\r\n    http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_mime.html\r\n    http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_mime_magic.html\r\n\r\n    If they use Microsoft Internet Information server, they need to do the same thing, just somewhere unknown to me. :-)\r\n\r\n    Glossary\r\n    http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/glossary.html#mime-type\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>Comment from: Matt Barton [Member] Ã‚Â· http://mattbarton.net</strong>\r\n\r\n    02/01/06 @ 00:31\r\n    Thanks! I sent this to them. Hopefully, they'll be able to fix this problem so I can go OGG.\r\n"
