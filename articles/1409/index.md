Oracle is expected today to [announce](http://news.com.com/Oracle+to+offer+free+database/2100-1012_3-5920796.html) a free (yes, free) limited version of its database called Oracle 10g Express Edition. 

This is clearly a reaction to pressure from the open source databases MySQL and PostgreSQL. It shows that free software is good for IT purchasers even if they don't use it. Downward price pressure is a natural side effect of the commoditization of software that has occurred as the free software phenomenon gives us a freer market.
