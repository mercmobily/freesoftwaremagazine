    body: "Thanks for the info, I was searching for a media server to use with PS3 and this post hit the target perfectly :)\r\n\r\nAnd here's one bit of information more for setting up mediatomb. It did not like scandinavic characters in id3-tags of mp3s, and threw errors like \"iconv: Invalid or incomplete multibyte or wide character\", \"... could not be converted to new encoding: invalid character sequence!\". These can be fixed by adding following lines to ~/.mediatomb/config.xml in import-section:\r\n\r\n    &lt;filesystem-charset&gt;ISO-8859-1&lt;/filesystem-charset&gt;\r\n    &lt;metadata-charset&gt;ISO-8859-1&lt;/metadata-charset&gt;\r\n\r\nNote that you have to delete the database (~/.mediatomb/mediatomb.db) and re-import the tracks for this to take effect.\r\n"

My music streams to my PS3 great... for about 20 seconds. After those 20ish seconds pass, the music stops and I'm sent back to the main music stem of the cross media bar on the PS3. Did I break it? :P\r\n\r\nThanks lots!"

XBox 360 can do it as well.  \r\n\r\nI saw a demo (Using PS3 and a set top UPnP box with LaCie drive) and was blown away by the easy setup and usefullness of UPnP.  I'm not sure why this isn't more widely available in America.  In Europe they have LCD TVs with ethernet/wireless and UPnP players built in as well as small set top UPnP player boxes so you can stream to any TV in the house.\r\n\r\nOf course a Windows Media PC is also a UPnP server and PS3 will pick it up as such."
