Some call it \"free software\", others \"open source\", there are those who try the middle ground and call it \"FLOSS\" or \"FOSS\", and those who go against the crowds and call it \"libre software\".\r\n\r\nWhat do you think we should call it and why?"

    body: "Oh come, what answer do you expect to get at a site called \"Free Software Magazine\"?\r\n\r\nI consider the whole issue to be pretty shallow. The <em>idea</em> of \"free software\" is far more important than what you call it, and I have little respect for valuing words over substance.\r\n\r\n\"Open source\" was conceived as a <em>marketing label</em> for free software in order to clarify what the term \"free software\" confused. It was never intended to replace \"free software\" as a term, and it certainly was never a \"new movement\" or a \"new concept\" in itself.\r\n\r\nThe FSF <em>created</em> a schism by insisting that \"open source\" didn't mean the same thing as \"free software\", despite the fact that it clearly does: the FSF's definition of \"free software\" includes, as a defining property, the openness of the source, and the OSI's definition of \"open source\", includes, as a defining property, the freedom of that source to be copied, modified, and redistributed. Each definition includes the properties of the other, hence, each is a subset of the other. Use your set theory: the only way this can happen is if they are the same set!\r\n\r\nYou'll also note that any license which includes only the \"freedom of the software\" (clearing legal obstacles) or only the \"openness of the source\" (clearing technical obstacles) is inadequate to satisfy <em>either</em> \"free software\" or \"open source\" definitions, making it clear that neither concept is complete without the other.\r\n\r\n(Any remaining differences between the FSD and the OSD are legalistic nitpicking details, inevitable when two different people attempt to codify the same concept in two different documents -- any free license worth using satisfies both)\r\n\r\nSo, my preferred term, in as much as I have one, is \"free-licensed open source software\".  This is because the two critical properties are the freedom of the <em>license</em> and the availability of the material in a transparent form for editing, which means having the source (an essential requirement for exercising that freedom -- as the whole DRM/TPM debacle with both GPLv3 and CCPLv3 makes ever more clear).\r\n\r\nIt's also quite clear that this complete name can be contracted in many different ways for convenience: \"free-licensed software\", \"open source software\", \"FLOSS\", \"free/open software\", and even \"free software\".\r\n\r\nWhich gets us back to the point which Shakespeare made (or tried to make, anyway) a <em>long time ago</em>: \"that which we call a rose...\".\r\n"

The title of your comment implies that you think we are tampering with the results or are cheating in some way. This is not the case.\r\n\r\nHowever, it might be that you think the poll is \"rigged\" because the question says \"What do you think we should call <em>free software</em>?\" (emphasis added). I guess it could have been phrased \"What do you think we should call <i>it</i>?\", but I think that would have been a fairly vague title and I think the one we chose is fine the way it is. I would hope our community knows what \"free software\" is and the available answers make it clear that it's each individual's choice to call it what they like.  \r\n\r\n<cite>\"Oh come, what answer do you expect to get at a site called \"Free Software Magazine\"?\"</cite>\r\n\r\nWell, we we're expecting to find out what our community thinks. We can't really expect anything more than that can we Terry? As you can see not everyone who reads FSM thinks \"it\" should be called free software, and that's what we were interested to find out. Of course, we are hoping that the results won't end up suggesting we have the wrong name for our magazine -- it would be pretty bad if most of our community preferred the term \"open source\" while we have the name Free Software Magazine.\r\n\r\nFurther, we thought the FSM community would find this poll and its results interesting. If you disagree Terry, and/or have any suggestions for future polls, you know what to do.\r\n\r\nThanks a lot for the rest of your comment. Your opinions are always well informed and well thought out and always add a lot to a discussion. \r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\n\r\n"

To them, the economic consequences of free licenses are manifestations of their ideology.\r\n\r\nAnd on the other, those who promote the economic value of free licenses are generally those who maintain a belief in a moral imperative towards pragmatism. They have a worldview in which unpragmatic ideas are immoral, because they are unstable. From their PoV, promoting an unstable but otherwise apparently moral ideology is actually wrong, because it will lead to failure and that failure will lead to elimination of whatever good the ideology provided.\r\n\r\nIt's just two different ways of looking at the same problem.\r\n\r\nOf course, things are politically much worse than this, because there are  actually much more than just <em>two</em> ways to look at the problem.\r\n\r\nThere are in fact at least four major organizations or movements with differing worldviews which have a stake in this issue:\r\n\r\nThe <a href=\"http://www.fsf.org\">Free Software Foundation</a> is interested in ideology and social-engineering. They are ostensibly user-focused, but the actual constituency is overwhelmingly developers.\r\n\r\nThe <a href=\"http://www.opensource.org\">Open Source Initiative</a> is (or was, the site seems pretty under-maintained these days) interested in the practical marketing of the economics of free software specifically to developers and funding organizations. It could be argued that OSI is no longer really needed because they acheived their mission.\r\n\r\nThe <a href=\"http://www.debian.org\">Debian</a> project is exclusively interested in end user freedoms. From their point of view, the FSF is perhaps too obsessed with copyleft.\r\n\r\nThe <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org\">Creative Commons</a> is interested primarily in non-program content (art, music, writing, etc), and are focused primarily on meeting the needs of creators (a position which has caused some major friction, due to their continued support for \"non-free\" licenses, such as the \"non-commercial\" module).\r\n\r\nThen again, we can also mention the various BSD projects; in science and medicine, there is the concept of \"Open Access\"; and there is a slowly growing interest in \"Open Hardware\". Then there's the whole \"Open Standards\" movement, which even includes some proprietary software developers.\r\n\r\nOne of the reasons why I like the term \"free licensing\" or \"free-licensed\" rather than \"free software\" -- besides being much less ambiguous -- is that it applies to things other than software, such as \"free-licensed hardware design\" or \"free-licensed artwork\".\r\n\r\n"

One is derived from the other, though I forget which came first.\r\n\r\nHowever, <a href=\"http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/copyleft.html\">\"copyleft\"</a> versus \"non-copyleft\" is a much more important distinction which <em>actually</em> says something about your values, whereas whether you use \"free software\" or \"open source software\" is pretty irrelevant -- at most it tells you what kind of mode you prefer to use in promoting the same idea.\r\n\r\nAnd this is not an academic point. At this very moment, there is a standing debate between the Creative Commons, which is currently determined to maintain a copyleft defense against the new threat of TPM measures. However, Debian is now promoting an <em>anti-copyleft</em> stance, claiming that \"user freedoms\" trump the bad effects caused by TPM copyleft breakage (their \"parallel distribution\" proposal fails to repair the damage that TPM distribution would do to the copyleft -- IMHO this is sufficient to make it untenable, but many within Debian apparently disagree. Of course we won't really know what the \"Debian Project\" thinks, until they have a \"GR\" and vote on the issue).\r\n\r\nAnd that's basically the point of the whole \"copyleft\" issue: which is more free? A license which preserves the freedom to innovate with a particular work indefinitely, or a license which allows the user all freedoms, including the freedom to destroy the freedom of the work?\r\n\r\n(Just to make things more complicated, CC argues that it is reasonable to apply this copyleft measure even to CC-By, because, unlike copyright law, TPM can remove <em>fair use/fair dealing</em> privileges. So, they argue, even the CC-By license needs this provision).\r\n\r\nI'm not going to try to tell you which is right (I have used and would recommend both approaches, depending on the circumstances), but deciding that says something real about your feelings and values.\r\n                     \r\nThe whole \"free\" versus \"open source\" thing is specious, though. It's like those Miller Lite beer ads: \"Tastes great!\", \"Less filling!\".\r\n\r\nWhich brings us back to beer analogies again, doesn't it? That's really too bad.  I hate beer.\r\n"

    body: "I think the person you were responding to is rejecting that definition because it's too obtuse. Sure, the FSF <em>wants</em> you to interpret \"free software\" that way; that's what <em>they</em> mean when they say it; but you can't co-opt the language that way—at least not easily.\r\n\r\nTo many people \"free software\" will continue to mean \"software you can get for free\". No amount of chanting the litany of Stallman will change that.\r\n\r\nI think he's got a point. That's why the Open Source Initiative was started. All this claptrap about \"different missions\" and \"ideology versus pragmatism\" is mostly smoke thrown up by the FSF because they felt threatened, and because there were personal politics in the mix (<em>Eric Raymond</em> surely prefers the \"pragmatic\" approach, but it's not clear that that's what \"Open Source\" is \"all about\": to many people \"openness\" is as meaningful and evocative of ideals as \"free\" is).\r\n\r\n\"Open Source\" is not and never has been a \"separate movement\" as Stallman likes to insist it is. It's just a marketing campaign. Distancing the \"Free Software Movement\" from the \"Open Source Movement\" is like distancing the \"Nike Movement\" from the \"'Just Do It!' Movement\".\r\n\r\nThe most appalling thing is that Stallman, when confronted with the fact that he had chosen a very confusing and misleading slogan for his ideology, instead of recognizing his error and taking steps to fix it, chose to <em>blame the English language</em>.\r\n\r\nThat's like me saying \"French is stupid because 'parles' and 'parlent' are pronounced the same—so I'll just pronounce it differently anyway! Then I'll correct all those stupid French people!\" (Not entirely made-up, I started learning French from a book, and had to unlearn this habit when I started taking classes! I knew I was wrong, but I did <em>feel</em> like saying that a few times).\r\n\r\nConcepts have always transcended the boundaries created by words, that's what makes writing (and slogans and branding) so challenging and creative an exercise. In Japanese, for example, there are so many homonyms, it's amazing they ever manage to communicate, so you have to be extra careful (e.g. \"shi\" can mean both \"four\" and \"death\", and probably quite a few other things—such languages rely on \"bound words\" and formulaic phrases to add clarity in such situations. So does English on occasion).\r\n\r\nStallman's not the first person to get bitten by an ambiguous phrase. You've probably heard what happened when Chevy tried to market a car called (in America) \"Nova\" in Spanish-speaking countries, where the name means \"doesn't go\". Shall we blame Spanish for that ambiguity? Did Chevy blindly soldier on, \"educating\" Spanish-speaking customers of the meaning of the Latin word \"Nova\" and its modern usage in English? Or did they <em>just change the name</em>?\r\n\r\nThe coincidence between \"free of cost\" and \"free of restrictions\" is not so dumb in English, in my opinion: it conveys the very wise observation that cost <em>is</em> a restriction. Too often, I think the free software movement alienates people who know that by going ballastic whenever somebody talks about the advantages of software that doesn't cost anything. Dismissing the issue of cost is pretty alienating to anyone who's ever been deprived or disappointed because of it (and that's most of the world).\r\n\r\nThe truth is that as a matter of market reality, free software <em>doesn't</em> cost anything to acquire, and that <em>is</em> a major advantage of it. The fact that we want it to be free of <em>both</em> cost and restrictions is the real point. In practice, there are essentially <em>no examples</em> of software which is \"free of restrictions\" but \"costs money to acquire\". Companies who \"charge for free software\" aren't: they are either charging for the service of writing software or they are charging for the services of installation and support. Money-making in the world of free software is all about some kind of service, not software as a good. The license makes the latter illusion largely untenable.\r\n\r\nFor people in capital-poor situations, this is a major life-saver, because it means you have the option to substitute labor for capital (so-called \"sweat capital\"). In fact, free software provides major leverage for such people, because it makes that labor go a lot further than if they had to write everything from scratch. It's both the freedom and the openness of the software that makes that possible.\r\n\r\nI have a lot of respect for Richard Stallman. He's done some amazing things: starting the GNU project, creating the GPL, and I respect the line he's taking with the GPLv3 (even on the days I'm not sure it's the right one). But it is infuriating to see him then make stupid mistakes, refuse to recognize that they are mistakes, and create major schisms and political situations over trivialities.\r\n\r\nStallman's impression of what \"open source\" means, versus what \"free\" means is terribly subjective (and from my point-of-view at least, quite inaccurate). Yet he states these opinions as if they were objective facts. That's the kind of thinking that gets you pigeon-holed into a tiny little community of \"like-minded people\" instead of being able to make contact and motivate people in the wider world. The real reason why \"open source\" has been so successful is because the people promoting it were simply willing to learn how to <em>speak other people's language</em> when communicating the concept, instead of pedantically offering to \"correct\" their \"misuse of the language\". Can you <em>get</em> more arrogant than that?\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, it's the <em>idea</em> of free software that matters. If the words \"free software\" convey that idea, then, great—use them. Inside of our community, they work fine, and people recognize them as jargon. Outside of that community, though, they are practically useless. You need to adjust your language if you want to be understood. And the only way that communities grow is by managing to communicate with the world outside of them.\r\n\r\nIncreasingly, that world is introduced to the idea as \"open source software\". So, it would behoove the \"free software movement\" if it wants to continue to have any relevance, to send the message that \"free software\" and \"open source\" software <em>are two names for the same thing</em>, instead of harping on the idea that they are names promoted by different groups of people.\r\n\r\nIt's a truly Liliputian argument!\r\n"
