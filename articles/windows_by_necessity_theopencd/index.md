As much as I despise MS-Windows, I live in a world that requires at least a working knowledge of the Worst OS In The Universe (tm). From my earliest experiences with MS-Windows 3.0, I looked for ways to make my life bearable: from the Workplace Shell demonstrations to the registry hacks of today, I try to make MS-Windows very unlike MS-Windows.

We make many sacrifices in the name of employment. Giving up our soul to MS-Windows should not be among them. It should bow to our will, not the other way ’round.

I gave up on MS-Windows a long, long time ago. After I discovered GNU/Linux, and OS/2, and other operating systems (VMS, for instance), I learned what an operating system should be: strong and pliable, adaptable and reliable. MS-Windows was none of these things. In fact, after exposure to other operating systems, MS-Windows was downright _insufferable_. This wasn’t helped by the release of MS-Windows 95, nor MS-Windows 2000 or XP. In fact, every release lead down the same boring, stultifying path: do things the MS-Windows way, or don’t do them at all. The latest release of MS-Windows Vista indicates the future is just as terrible as the past.

So I appreciate every little thing that makes MS-Windows more palatable. Particularly, if that means anything that makes it a little less restrictive, a little more free.

And that brings me to [TheOpenCD](http://www.theopencd.org/), a collection of superb free software. all on a single CD, with an easy-to-use installation program, thirty-three packages of free software goodness. Here’s the list:


* Blender
* GNU Image Manipulation Program (the GIMP)
* Inkscape
* NVU
* Scribus
* Tux Paint
* Battle for Wesnoth
* Enigma
* Neverball
* Sokoban YASC
* Azureus
* FileZilla
* Firefox
* Gaim (now [Pidgin IM](http://developer.pidgin.im/))
* HTTrack
* RSSOwl
* Thunderbird
* TightVNC
* WinSCP
* Audacity
* Celestia
* Really Slick Screensavers
* Stellarium
* MoinMoin
* OpenOffice.org
* PDFCreator
* Notepad2
* 7-zip
* Abakt
* Clamwin
* GTK+
* HealthMonitor
* Workrave

This is quite an impressive list of software, representing the _creme de la creme_ of free software available for MS-Windows. It is certainly an indispensable CD, and worthy of handing out to family, if not strangers on the street. No, it doesn’t make MS-Windows a decent operating system, by any stretch of the imagination. But it does make MS-Windows more bearable.

And that is an accomplishment worth celebrating.
