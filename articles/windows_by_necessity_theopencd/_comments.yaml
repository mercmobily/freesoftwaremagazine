    body: "While the OpenCD comes with some great software for windows, I have found that there is still room for more then what the OpenCD has on it.  I've started keeping a 'repository' of Open Source windows programs on my USB HDD.  I have most of the programs on the OpenCD, plus few more 'necessary' programs.  When my family calls and needs a quick computer fix, it always comes with me and I just add a bit of \"Foss\" to their lives.  \r\n\r\nThe best part is, I can add to the 'repository' when ever I want.  If a new version of a program, I just download the new version.  No need for a new cd.  If my family really wants a CD/DVD, I can easily burn it for them.\r\n\r\nThe OpenCD project is a great project and is what led to my idea of keeping my own 'repository'.  But if you find yourself always helping your Windows friends, you may need to keep your own so you can always have it up to date."

It also means you can carry apps round on a pendrive ready to use when you need them on a windows PC.\r\n\r\nThis means Open Office on any Windows PC to access your documents.  Gaim & Thunderbird already set up with your accounts.  Firefox with your preferences, extensions & bookmarks in place."

    body: 'Windows at work/ Linux at home. I cannot convince the large company I work for to uproot Windows and go for Linux. Yes, I can show them how fast it is, or how much less disk space it uses, meaning that we do not need to replace our boxes each year. I can show how spreadsheets are just as nice and how the gimp is so superior to paint and any number of things. But, Mr. gates has his hooks in this business too. So, I propose Windows at work/ Linux at home. Perhaps, in the near future someone here will realize we beta test his junk. Oh well.'
