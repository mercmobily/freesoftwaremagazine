    body: "I'm not a lawyer, but AFAIK in Poland we can make a copy of legally bought media, so we don't accidentally damage the original while using it.\r\nAnd if talking about music we can share our MP3s with people staying in close relationship with us. But this right does not alow us to share computer programs unless the programs' license allows it.\r\n"
