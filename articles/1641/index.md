Hello, everyone. I'm doing some research into the history of backwards compatibility and thought I might hit up the gurus here for some facts and resources I can look to for additional information.

Basically, I want to start by talking about some of the early IBM mainframes' efforts to incorporate BC, and extend that into a discussion of everything from desktops to game consoles. Just to let you know, my slant will be that BC is self-defeating in the long run. If you have any trivia or good sources that might help me out, please let me know as soon as possible. The article will of course be licensed under a CC.

Thanks, Matt!
