They canÃ¯Â¿Â½t be helping US technological firms at all and could well be handicapping them. IÃ¯Â¿Â½m thinking that if the Europeans can succeed in keeping these idiotic legal shenanigans out of the continent then technological companies here can operate without the handicap that the US ones suffer.\r\n\r\n\"\"\"\r\n\r\nNow you know the real reason we want y'all to legalize software patents!\r\n\r\nI seriously thought about writing a tongue-in-cheek article advocating software patents in Europe as a way to protect us (in the US) from the dangers of innovation, etc., etc.\r\n\r\nBut I just know somebody would take me seriously.
