Days ago I read [this announcement](http://www.crn.com/sections/breakingnews/breakingnews.jhtml;?articleId=193600331) about Sun moving Java's license to free software, and in particular that some parts of it will be released under the GPL


=IMAGE=www_sun_com.jpg=www.sun.com early this morning (GMT+1)=

Today on [www.sun.com](http://www.sun.com/) they are announcing a webcast today at 9.30 Pacific Time

Are we nearly there?

**UPDATE:**

[we are:](http://www.sun.com/2006-1113/feature/story.jsp)


>13.November.2006—Sun believes deeply in creating communities and sharing innovations and technologies to foster more participation. Today in a historic move, Sun is opening the door to greater innovation by open sourcing key Java implementations—Java Platform Standard Edition (Java SE), Java Platform Micro Edition (Java ME), and Java Platform Enterprise Edition (Java EE)—under the GNU General Public License version 2 (GPLv2), the same license as GNU/Linux.
