    body: "I'm not sure this really constitutes “leading”. Python, Perl, and Ruby all enable cross-platform application development. Python at least has been around since the early 1990s and has been available under a completely \"free\" license since 2000 at the latest (the earlier license would probably be regarded as free by most people, but was GPL incompatible).\r\n\r\nStill, it is nice to see Sun <em>following</em> the lead of others after only ten or so years of lag time. ;-)\r\n\r\nQuite a few people seem to like Java, and there's a lot of free software written for it which had to previously be regarded as \"contrib\" since it brought in the non-free JRE as a requirement. It'll be interesting to see what packages will be affected.\r\n\r\nFor one thing, it'll resolve Debian's long-standing Java policy crisis.\r\n"

I liked this:\r\n\r\n<em>Sun played a video of Stallman not just saying that \"the Java trap won't exist anymore\" (as it applies to Java), he gave a stunning endorsement of Sun's behavior and contribution (as the largest contribution of its kind to the free software community). It was a complete 180 degree turn in disposition for the leader of the free software world.</em>\r\n\r\nI <a href=\"http://www.technewsworld.com/story/8F5qWE1kpU9zZC/Elections-Arrogance-Blogs-and-Passion.xhtml\">read something</a> about how RMS's arrogance may have contributed to the MS/Novell deal:\r\n\r\n<em>For OSS, as we mentioned last week and the week before, the Oracle move against Red Hat and the Microsoft-Novell deal might not have occurred had it not been for the incredibly arrogant way Richard Stallman was treating the companies that supported Linux.</em>\r\n\r\nAnd I wonder if people like the author of that piece will look at this news as a demonstration of what happens when you remain consistent in your beliefs and values.  And patient.  Maybe it's not arrogance, but instead is commitment to a plan that is working.\r\n\r\nThis is very welcome news, and I'm happy that Sun chose the GPL over the Apache license.\r\n\r\n\r\n----\r\n<a href=\"http://www.movingtofreedom.org/\" title=\"Freedom is on the March!\">http://www.movingtofreedom.org/</a>"

He didn't support this claim at all, and I frankly don't see how anything Stallman has said could be interpreted as driving either the Oracle/Red Hat or Novell/Microsoft events.\r\n\r\nBoth seem to be fairly clearcut cases of companies seeking to take advantage at the expense of other companies.\r\n\r\nEDIT: Oh wait, that was Rob Enderle? No wonder."
