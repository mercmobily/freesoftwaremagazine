    body: "I'm not sure but I think I detect some irony in your comment. Anyway Tony has said he will only \"write it once\" so [here's his response](http://www.freesoftwaremagazine.com/articles/editorial_17#comment-68809) to a previous comment on this subject.\r\n\r\nI say that if a proprietary company is stupid enough to advertise to a bunch of people who are at least aware (or getting there) of the pitfalls of the licencing then they get what they pay for - nothing.\r\n\r\nSmile nicely, take their money and run, I say."
