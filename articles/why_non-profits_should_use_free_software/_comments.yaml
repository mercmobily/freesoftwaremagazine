    body: "Thanks for this, I always use the price argument when promoting FLOSS to social enterprises, simply because I want to grab their attention, and it's an easy argument to rehearse. But of course this causes another problem, convincing organizations that free doesn't equal useless. what we need is a concerted propaganda effort to put forward the concept that Open Source is the natural choice for this sector, because we share common values, and because the software is better as a result of those values.\r\nIt is worth remembering one of the axioms of the voluntary sector. it isn't that we do things cheap, but that we  do things differently, and this is true of FLOSS too."

    body: "Oddly enough one of the reasons I have heard (a few times now) for the move towards \"professionalism\"--particularly in IT--is that the charity in questions is fed up of being \"fobbed off\" with sub-standard services/kit/software because it's cheap.\r\nThat's why the low or zero cost argument is not always a great place to start. Ethical arguments may work better, as we both suggest, and the message of quality free software has to remain.\r\n\r\nHaving said that at the latest free software event ([see other my blog entry](http://www.freesoftwaremagazine.com/blogs/how_to_host_a_free_software_advocacy_event)) I attended the ethical argument was presented and somebody beside me muttered \"ethics are fine but I need to save costs\" :o). It should be said that they had not long started in this sector--having just come from the corporate sector.\r\n\r\nRyan\r\n"

    body: "There's another reason not to use the zero-cost as an argument: sometimes you aren't the cheapest!\r\n\r\nProprietary companies will often donate commercial software or equipment to charities or schools -- knowing full well that this encourages an addiction to their software which will pay off later.\r\n\r\nYou have to look beyond immediate cost to see why free software is essential. The truth is, though, this isn't really that different for non-profits than it is for for-profits -- proprietary software lock-in is a hazard for both.\r\n"

    body: "In addition to this even small UK charities can get low cost proprietary software as part of a select agreement if they become a member of umbrella bodies like the National Council of Voluntary Organisations. For example I can get MS Office 2007 Professional for about Â£60 per licence. Against that \"zero cost for software you've not heard of\" becomes a less persuasive argument with the finance director.\r\n\r\nVendor-format lock-in alone is also not always effective as the perception is that everyone uses Word so it'll be around forever. A combination of arguments which are specific to and demonstrably (and genuinely) aimed at the charities interests is best.\r\n"
