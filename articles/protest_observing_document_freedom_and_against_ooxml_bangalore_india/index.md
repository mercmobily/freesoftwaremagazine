Today evening (15th April, 2008) a candle light vigil/protest was organised at the 
Town Hall, Bangalore, India to observe Document freedom and also to apply pressure 
on the Indian Govt. to file an appeal with the ISO regarding the passing of OOXML 
amid serious irregularities. The vigil was organised by the Free Software Users Group, 
Bangalore and was attended by Engineering college students, IT profesionals and 
even members from a local slum computer training centre.
This is just the beginning as more serious and sustained activities are being planned.
