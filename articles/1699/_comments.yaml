    body: "Reading documentation is a good (and novel) idea, but another tried and true technique is to look at other entries and copy how they do things there.  That and the preview function will get you a long way.  There is a lot of good documentation though, and I've actually even read some to figure out how to recommend a spam page for deletion.\r\n\r\nI've been contributing to Wikipedia since December and find it very rewarding.  I hope we can keep it up, especially when I keep adding links to wiki articles from my startup blog at  <a href=\"http://www.movingtofreedom.org\">http://www.movingtofreedom.org</a>.\r\n\r\nAnother thing I tried for the first time yesterday was contributing to www.gutenberg.org.  I proofread a few pages and got a similar buzz from that as I get from Wikipedia.\r\n"
