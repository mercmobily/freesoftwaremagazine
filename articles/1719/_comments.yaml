    body: "The problem here is, when anyone hears the word \"Linux\", they assume that there's gonna be nothing but command line. They retain that view of what the older generation of Linux distros represented, where \"only geeks use it\". (Even some PC enthusiasts use this excuse in those \"Linux vs Windows\" forum flame fests).\r\n\r\nThis has obviously changed in recent times, as \"easy to use\" distros (Ubuntu, OpenSUSE, etc), have started to raise interest for people (at least raise some sort of curiosity, that yes, there is an alternative that offers things that Microsoft does not). Granted, they aren't completely perfect yet, but they have established a stepping stone into the desktop market. It may not be a big step, but its an important one. At least they're very usable for those desktop folks who have general desktop needs. (email, web, video, music, etc).\r\n\r\nI guess we have our own reasons for trying alternatives.\r\n\r\nMine were:\r\n\r\n(1) When MS started talking about \"Windows Genuine Advantage\" (WGA) and implementing DRM-style technologies from WinXP onwards. This just scared me into looking elsewhere. (I'm still trying to understand what exactly does WGA offer in regards to \"Advantage\"! I don't get it.)\r\n\r\n(2) As a geek and a self-taught newbie programmer, the more I looked into things, the more depressing things got, finding out how MS has cause much grief for many around the world. This motivated me into dropping MS based solutions where possible. (at least look for equivalent or alternative solutions).\r\n\r\n(3) Every time something went wrong, Windows often noted some cryptic error message. (You know when you get that BSOD and you get a bunch of digits/letters as the error code? That irritated me because I couldn't really do something about it!). It doesn't tell me much as to what cause it or why...This is where I started appreciating what open-source offered. I like the fact that logs aren't too much of a problem to go through. The better part is when I can do something about a problem! (I used to feel a bit helpless and annoyed...Now I get satisfaction in I learning something new. I was able to do things myself and actually got a good idea of what was going on).\r\n\r\n(4) Switching to Linux gave power back to me...The owner of the system. I've never actually read MS's \"End-User License Agreement\" (EULA)...But once I did, I realised it was something I don't agree with. (which pushed me into building my own PCs and looking for notebooks that don't come with Windows...Or at least ask the seller if they offered the option not to include it).\r\n\r\nAnyway, its good to see another Aussie Linux User. (ALU) :)\r\n"

    body: "Ok here's the other story. I've been an avid LInux supporter for years ( and still am ) but then I got a notebook and all that changed. It is an Asus and as such there was no help from the manufacturer into getting things working under linux. That's fine since I've been usign linux for years changing distros and such and I was pretty used to dealing with problems. Only I decided to ditch the onboard sound and go for Echo Indigo. In theory there is a linux driver only in practice getting it to work on my brand new AMD64 notebook was a no-go. For one the pcmcia bus simply did not work and there was some lengthy fix which also did nothing in mu case. Turns out the dev team botched up something ( finally fixed after over and year ). I wasn't about to let my > $100 sound card collect dust so I was forced into using Windows. And the funny thing was that it was actually faster for most things. Configuration was faster, although this is very relative since you have to install each app separately and then configure it, and most system maintenance tasks take less time. ( keep in mind that for quite some time I used to make my living as a sys admin of various Windows labs and other computers ) Over the last 1 1/2 year I have actually relearned to live with Windows day in and day out. Sure I had to lear the meaning of \"If it ain't broken don't fix it\" and how much it applies to Windows. While you can do just about any customization often it takes way too long and the chance of messing things up is great. For the first 2 months I was constantly trying to make windows look like my linux desktop only to give realizing that the capabilities for customization of some parts of windows are just not there. All in all, with the help of some not so leagle for my personal use software ( SAV and several others ) and my moderate windows tweaking I have managed to survive as a fultime Windows user for quite some time now. And the funny thing is that I'm beginning to like it. All I used to do before was basic tasks and coding in VS. But latelly I don't even feel like switching over to my linux desktop. Yes Windows can't do things the way Linux can but it does pretty well for the most part. You do have to respect it's limitations though. And ... if I had to licence all the software that I use I'd go bankrupt ...\r\nAnyway, just though I tell you about my experience going from Linux to Windows ( because I had to ). "

    body: "Windows technically is a good operating system. almost every proprietary software which able to be run on top of windows are sophisticated too. The real problem is if I use windows and various proprietary sofware on my machine, it is just too much money for me and give me many limitations. Then, if I can use free as in free market* operating system and the whole world of free software which are very high quality and sophisticated(just like Open Office.org, GNOME, and GNU Emacs) for gratis, why not?\r\n\r\nIn addition, I feel much safer by using free software. I am sure that there is no mallicious code exist on software I am using. Moreover, I can copy free software freely into my other machines and my family's. It's really great advantage of free software over proprietary software.\r\n\r\nBut yes, I am regretting so much I can not use free software all the time. At university and work I am forced to use proprietary software(I am writing this one with proprietary operating system, although I am using free web browser).\r\n\r\nThanks for you dear richard, gnu project, free software community and this beautiful magazine for make these all happen. :D\r\n\r\nNote: Free software is free as in freedom. But there are many people confuse free software as in gratis software. But, perhaps if we refer free software as in free market, many people will notice it because free market refer into freedom and not gratis. But I do not know yet whether this is appropriate or not. Suggestion please?"
