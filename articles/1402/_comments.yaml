    body: "<strong>Comment from: Lori Angela Nagel [Visitor] Ã‚Â· http://www.jastiv.com</strong>\r\n\r\n    10/28/05 @ 12:42\r\n    The big thing both licenses have in common is this, you can't have some proprietary entity taking your work, making derivatives, and the not allowing you or other third parties to continue to make derivatives of this new work. I'm sure a lot of people want to avoid that in order to reuse their own modified work,\r\n\r\n    There was a discussion http://www.wesnoth.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=8113recently on the Battle for Wesnoth forums about the suitability of the GPL for artwork. I think this issue needs to be be brought up again before it comes back to get us later.\r\n    I see creative commons by-sa and GPL as being very similar, but also somewhat different, in addition to requiring derivative works to be licensed under the same licensed, they also have each have a separate different requirement. For the GPL, this is the requirement for the source code, a requirement that some people have difficulty with, as this discussion states. The biggest problem seems to be that everyone does not necessarily agree on what the preferred form of the work for making modifications is. For programs this is easy, you just have a plain text file, for art there is .xcf, .png, .jpg, psd etc.\r\n\r\n    I wonder if someone will address this in GPL 3.0, unless of course, as some seem to suggest, addressing it will cause more harm than good. It seems however, that the issues will come up sooner or later no matter how hard we try to suppress or ignore them, so it is better to take a look at them now, rather than later when even more stuff is made available under these licenses. Yet these programing projects like everything to be under the GPL. After all, as you stated, a game is not going to be successful no matter how many artists you have if you can't find one single programmer.\r\n    Fortunately for projects like a piece of music or collaborative artworks, you can keep the programmers out. For by-sa this is the requirement that you give credit to the author, I would hate to see the list for some project that ended up with thousands of contributers on some tiny file so that the lists ends up being larger than the file.\r\n    So, given these problems with the current popular licenses, should I write up another license to fix them? Hell no, the last thing we need is more incompatible licenses floating around. We have all heard the horor story of the OSI and how companies write up licenses to try and meet their particular goals, but really, I think people do not want to spend all their time reading and writing licenses unless maybe they are lawyers. Programmers would rather code, artists would rather draw, and musicians would rather compose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>Comment from: Vance [Visitor]</strong>\r\n\r\n    10/28/05 @ 16:50\r\n    A couple points:\r\n    First, it's not the case that a GPL program can only be assembled from all-GPL components. There are a number of licenses compatible with the GPL. For example, one can take new BSD-licensed code and incorporate it into a GPL'd project because it's possible to meet the requirements of both licenses simultaneously. I'm not all that familiar with the Creative Commons licenses, so I don't know how they interact with the GPL.\r\n    Second, it may not even be necessary for the license for the artwork to be compatible with the license for the software. I regularly (and perfectly legally) use GPL software to view images and listen to music which are \"All rights reserved.\" If the artwork and music exist as separate files from the game software, the fact that the artwork and software licenses are different may be a non-issue.\r\n    I'd suggest you contact the Software Freedom Law Center to see if they've done any work in this area. They've surely got the brainpower and experience to illuminate these issues.\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>Comment from: Terry Hancock [Member] Ã‚Â· http://www.anansispaceworks.com</strong>\r\n\r\n    10/29/05 @ 17:36\r\n\r\n    Just a brief response to the comments (I'll follow up in more detail in my next blog entry).\r\n\r\n        First, it's not the case that a GPL program can only be assembled from all-GPL components. There are a number of licenses compatible with the GPL. For example, one can take new BSD-licensed code \r\n\r\n    Absolutely, but the BSD (and MIT, X11, etc) license provides no copyleft protection for the author. Therefore, it's a fairly unattractive choice for many authors.\r\n\r\n    On the other hand, I'm not aware of any way to make a copyleft license which is GPL compatible, without explicitly allowing conversion (as the LGPL does for example), or dual-licensing, which is almost, but not quite the same thing (the distinction is that if you merely allow conversion, you don't have to provide the whole GPL package, as described below).\r\n\r\n        Second, it may not even be necessary for the license for the artwork to be compatible with the license for the software. \r\n\r\n    Yeah, this is trying to invoke the \"mere aggregation\" clause. Also, the data processed by a program is not affected by the license. But in practice, this is a matter of interpretation; and it depends rather finely on the design of the software.\r\n\r\n        I see creative commons by-sa and GPL as being very similar, but also somewhat different, in addition to requiring derivative works to be licensed under the same licensed, they also have each have a separate different requirement. For the GPL, this is the requirement for the source code \r\n\r\n    The GPL requires both the source code and the full text of the GPL license to travel with the work. That means typically that the work can only be distributed as a ZIP or TAR archive package. This is fairly inconvenient for images or music files, since people tend to want to distribute those as separate files (in fact, you often can't use them unless you do that, given the limitations of client applications). Even if it's technically possible, it's often more hassle than it's worth.\r\n\r\n    In practice, many people write code or create art and then offhandedly say \"this can be distributed under the terms of the GPL\" without really understanding what that means. While strictly speaking this is not illegal (they being the copyright holder), it does not encourage compliance. To be truly compliant, anyone receiving such a work, in order to redistribute it, must add the license text and package the result! Of course, almost no one ever does that! The result is that the work actually gets distributed according to informal \"you know what I mean\" rules that are not actually the GPL (but instead, very close to what the By-SA actually does say).\r\n\r\n        So, given these problems with the current popular licenses, should I write up another license to fix them? Hell no, the last thing we need is more incompatible licenses floating around. \r\n\r\n    The reason for my cautionary tale, is precisely this -- multiple copyleft licenses create conflicts, and we currently have no mechanism to resolve them (other than getting the original author to permit re-licensing).\r\n\r\n    By adhering to a relatively new and somewhat experimental license, I got myself into a bit of a pickle! On the other hand, it remains true that the GPL is a poor choice for art because the language is difficult to interpret in that context (you wind up having to say something like \"for the purposes of this license, 'source code' means...\", detailed language which only a lawyer could love, and most artists find repulsive). The By-SA is pretty good, and I might've used that originally had I known it would be as successful as it has been.\r\n"
