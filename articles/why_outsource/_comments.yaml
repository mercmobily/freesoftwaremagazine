It was just waiting for the right technology (and other factors, like education) to come along to make it ecomonically viable.\r\n\r\nIt has nothing to do with inexperienced companies going belly up because of incomplete business plans. Or nurf battles. Or even IT out-sourcing, which is just economically driven.\r\n\r\n________________________________________\r\n\r\nFrom: anonymous\r\nUrl:\r\nDate: 2005-10-07\r\nSubject: laws and unions\r\n\r\nif anything this makes me think that employment laws regarding age discrimination - both during the hiring phase and in the workplace - need to be re-evaluated.\r\n\r\nalso, i wish there was a rise of unions again, especially in the technology space. too many certifications (from large corporations) and not enough ground-roots efforts by the workers. telecommunications had to have it (well, they also needed regulations, which the internet clearly does not).\r\n\r\n________________________________________\r\n\r\nFrom: Andre Holliday (SUBSCRIBER!)\r\nUrl:\r\nDate: 2005-10-12\r\nSubject: Don't be too quick to let the companies off the hook\r\n\r\nTom makes some good points in this essay. He laments the passing of an era where certain virtues used to thrive; I also miss those days. I'm looking forward to part two, but a little history is in order.\r\n\r\nIn the 1980s and '90s, quite a few big companies betrayed the loyalty that Tom and his sister observed in their parents toward their employers and work. Merger mania was all the rage, and firing as many workers as possible was looked upon very favorably by Wall Street--the more workers axed, the higher the stock prices climbed. People who had made lifelong contributions to their employers in the form of work well done, consistent progress, high-quality customer service, and who felt a general moral obligation to do right by the companies that had done right by them, were gratuitously cast aside.\r\n\r\nAs a consequence, the idea of being loyal to companies that engaged in such boorish behavior was viewed as misguided at best. Withholding loyalty from them was indeed a healthy response. Unfortunately, most companies, if not all, were deemed suspect, so that anyone loyal to any company was perceived to be a chump.\r\n\r\nAs it became more fashionable for companies to \"downsize,\" some people questioned whether the old, tried-and-true fundamentals still applied in this new world of chainsaw management. If some old, venerable firms were succeeding quite well by unceremoniously dumping good, hard-working, loyal employees, was loyalty necessary? could it be a liability? Could a slow and steady pace be too slow to win the race? Why were so many in middle and upper management so eager to dispense with long-term visions that required planning, consistent execution, and a loyal workforce to bring them to fruition--a loyal workforce whose absence could only result in failure? The Adams of this world did not have the power to create this sorry state of affairs.\r\n\r\nI suggest that many big, stable companies created this environment, and that they did it by recklessly turning their backs on loyalty and long-term planning, and by pursuing quick riches with willful disregard for the inevitable consequences. I would further suggest that those companies chased the best employees away, because said employees were deemed to have \"too-high\" salaries, even though they had earned every penny with high productivity, excellent customer service, and--need I say--loyalty. There was a deliberate policy of replacing them with less experienced, nay, inexperienced, workers because they could be paid a pittance. These companies fomented fear, distrust, and nurtured an otherwise poisonous atmosphere, by so shabbily betraying good, solid, reliable, loyal workers.\r\n\r\nNow that those companies have apparently killed the golden goose here, they seek it elsewhere, lamenting that our workers are uneducated, unskilled, inexperienced, impatient, have no regard for customer service, and, above all else, lack a sense of loyalty. In this way, they sowed the seed that became Adam, irresponsible and destructive, running away from the mess they had made, leaving suffering in their wake. As bad as Adam may seem, these companies are far worse, because they used to know--and do--better.\r\n\r\nIf these same companies stay the course they have been on for some twenty-odd years, they will kill whatever golden goose they find in the host countries to which they are so enthusiastically outsourcing everything.\r\n\r\n________________________________________\r\n\r\n    From: Tom Jackiewicz\r\n    Url: www.sun4c.net\r\n    Date: 2005-11-28\r\n    Subject: Comments\r\n\r\n    Andre,\r\n\r\n    I'm hopefully going to explore the situation from all sides. You make some good points and that side of things will definitely be taken into account.\r\n\r\n    I just wanted to place a bit of the blame on my own generation for things because it seems to be too easy to blame everything on the companies -- though they do deserve a hell of a lot of blame.
