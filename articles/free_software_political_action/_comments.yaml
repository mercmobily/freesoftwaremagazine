    body: "Since this article was written Yankeetown held elections for the entire council and the mayor.  The entire government is new and was elected with a sweeping mandate to resist the development as it was originally attempted.  A special communications officer has been appointed to leverage lessons learned from the saveyankeetown.com web site and create an official town web presence.  While not everyone is happy, there is a renewed sense of civic purpose throughout the town.\r\n\r\nYet FDLE investigations are still on-going.  The developer is threatening to sue everyone involved.  And now the town is being threatened with a huge expansion of the aggregate mining operation just south of the river.  So a battle was won but a war is still being fought.  Stay tuned!\r\n\r\nandy\r\n"
