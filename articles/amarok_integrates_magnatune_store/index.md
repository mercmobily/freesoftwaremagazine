[John Buckman](http://blogs.magnatune.com/buckman/) has [announced](http://blogs.magnatune.com/buckman/2006/11/amarok_adds_mag.html) that [Amarok](http://amarok.kde.org/), the popular KDE music player, now includes an integrated store for his company [Magnatune](http://www.magnatune.com/), one of the largest netlabels offering DRM-free, CC-licensed music, and a fair deal for their musicians.

This is an inspired move by all parties involved - as well as making it easier than ever before for music fans to access Magnatune's catalogue, it provides newcomers to GNU/Linux with an alternative to the functionality that they have come to expect from Apple's DRM-encumbered iTunes service. In addition, Amarok and Magnatune have the advantage of of providing all the practical benefits of free software, un-DRM'd open formats and liberal licensing.

If that wasn't enough to make the Magnatune store a very attractive proposition, 10% of the price of each sale from the Amarok Magnatune store will go straight back to the Amarok project, providing an attractive way to support one of the most exciting free software projects around.
