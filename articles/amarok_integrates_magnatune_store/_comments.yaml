So, have an option and all will be cool and no needless forks.  Forks have their place (the GCC problems), but it''s better to try and get it resolved first.'

There is already an application called Sharp Musique which will allow you to interface with the iTunes music store, just  integrate that into Amarok.  Probably a lot of red tape involved. Big problem I run into trying to convert MS devotees to Linux is the infamous question, "Will I be able to use iTunes on it?"  Then I switch into my Amarok sales pitch which doesn''t go very far.'

    body: "Until Magnatune can get some mainstream artists into it's catalog, I wouldn't be calling it an alternative to iTunes.  At the moment the best I think it can be called is a complement to iTunes.  It seems like a good place to go and get some great music from minor artists (which I personally plan to check out) and their catalog seem quite large for a startup which is impressive.  However, in the previous poster's Amarok sales pitch, this is probably one of the reason's why his/her pitch dies so fast.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, not all people are willing to spend the extra time in the \"unknown\" to find things (be it solutions to problems, or music they like), as I find most Open-Source users to be.  Most iTunes users I know go to iTunes for a couple reasons:  first it has most of the mainstream artists available (and they are simply not into indie bands unless they have been played on the local radio stations) and secondly, it is far easier for them to pay a bit to iTunes to get a good digital copy of something, rather than rip it themselves (or \"borrow\" a copy off limewire or whatever).\r\n\r\nDon't get me wrong, I think Magnatunes is a great idea, and I for one will be taking a close look at it.  But then, again, I am an open-source user and love to find new indie artists, etc.  Perhaps Magnatunes integration with Last.fm would be a smart move as well, since there seem to be a lot of people on there that have a wide variety of musical tastes."
