    body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nJust to let you know that I am a law student and that I will be referncing your article to explain what is a netlabel which I think, if developped to conform with actual legal copyright frameworks could give an excellent levy to new and start-up music recording artists. Lawsuits from the BIG FOUR are killing the creativity but at the same time one has to balance profitability, copyrights of owner and personal freedom to access the music.\r\n\r\nThank you!"

    body: "I read this article sometime back and I would like to say that the content is excelent. I really think that most tech people live in a buble and the facination with  itunes really create a monopoly and usually better models get killed because of the notoriety of a firm. \r\n\r\nThis labels is a great concept of things to come and I would love to see them succeed and spread into more popular and flat models. \r\n\r\nAcording to this article, most of the labels are non-US and this might be a handicap. However since after all is the internet, how hard is to get it to run wtihin the US and make it work. It will certainly attract the reviewers attentions and maybe change the phase of current archaic models. \r\n\r\nAlthough I am a afraid too since the traditional RIAA style companies will take it as a threat and find a way to make them illegal, just like the net-radio stations.\r\n\r\nAlexandro Colorado"
