Hopefully, you will be able to do something in a similar fashion in the future.\r\n\r\n    It was fun while it lasted!\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>Comment from: rekrutacja [Visitor]</strong>\r\n\r\n    2005-11-28 @ 11:13\r\n    Arrrrggggghhhhh! You almost did it. You were really close.\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>Comment from: Terry Hancock [Member] Ã‚Â· http://www.anansispaceworks.com</strong>\r\n\r\n    2005-11-28 @ 15:23\r\n    Hmm. That's too bad.\r\n\r\n    I can't disagree though, I know I couldn't find enough time to post much of anything.\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>Comment from: rekrutacja [Visitor]</strong>\r\n\r\n    2005-11-29 @ 01:05\r\n    If you cannot do it, why you cannot let us do it? Rerun it as digg.com type website, and we will see...\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>Comment from: Tony Mobily [Member]</strong>\r\n\r\n    2005-11-29 @ 01:41\r\n    Hi,\r\n\r\n    two problems here:\r\n\r\n    * Writing a \"digg.com-style\" site takes a _lot_ of time and a _lot_ of resources. A piece of software that does what digg.com does (that is, allows people to \"digg\" stories etc.) doesn't currently exist\r\n\r\n    * The required resources to run something like that are _huge_. I am talking about bandwidth, CPU, RAM, etc.\r\n\r\n    :-|\r\n\r\n    Merc,\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>Comment from: anonymous coward [Visitor]</strong>\r\n\r\n    2005-11-29 @ 05:47\r\n\r\n    I was also wondering where fsdaily was gone. I am using firefox live bookmarks, and it just kept saying \"failed to load live bookmarks\", so I did not know what happened until I read this.\r\n\r\n    Well, bad news, good news. Who knows? [ref.]\r\n    Maybe the sole classic freesoftwaremagazine site is better, with no tr, fl and childrens' noise.\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>Comment from: Robin Monks [Member]</strong>\r\n\r\n    2005-11-29 @ 12:14\r\n    So, do chance of using a sourceforge hosting, eh? :-)\r\n\r\n    I'm sorry to see it have to go, it could have been great.\r\n\r\n    Robin\r\n"
