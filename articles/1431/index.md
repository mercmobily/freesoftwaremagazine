You may have noticed that fsdaily.com is redirected to www.freesoftwaremagazine.com.

Why?

The answer is simple: at the moment, we don't have the resources to run it.

On one hand, I am talking about _hardware_ resources: we spent quite a while configuring the site using Slash (which is great for creating communities). However, Slash itself used a lot of CPU and RAM—and we simply couldn't afford it.

On the other hand, after running it for only a short while we realised that it wasn't only a hardware problem: fsdaily.com overloaded _us_, and took time away from our core focus: Free Software Magazine.

Why did we decide to effectively kill fsdaily.com so quickly? After all, the site wasn't doing badly at all. A lot of people were accessing it, and the traffic was growing. _This_ was exactly the problem: as soon as we realised that we effectively couldn't afford to run fsdaily.com, we stopped it—before too many people had left valuable comments on it, and had invested much of their time reading it.

So, please accept our apologies for not being able to continue with fsdaily.com. At the same time, rest assured that all the time we don't spend on fsdaily.com will be spent making Free Software Magazine the best magazine that we can.

Thank you!
