    body: "Call me old-fashioned but I don't like to read major stuff online. I prefer to print it out and a single PDF makes that a very good experience. An online HTML magazine is a pain to print out, what with all the crazy pagination issues. Why not provide a compressed archive of the HTML at least?\r\n\r\nI'm also concerned that eliminating the PDF file is the beginning of the end for freesoftwaremagazine, similar to the fate of Tux Magazine. I'm afraid its a cost cutting measure. I see it that way because I don't recognize the loss of the PDF file as being of benefit to the reader. No reader says \"damn this nasty PDF article.\"\r\n\r\nPlease return with the PDF version of the magazine.\r\n\r\n- John"

    body: "First, if you are here only to comment about the loss of the PDF version, get out. The author already explained the reasons to do this. I miss the PDF version also, but facing the reasons that have been presented, and - it seems to me - all the attempting to solve this question, I can't complain of not trying.\r\n\r\nSecond, about the Media Center, it really is interesting, except that i live in Europe, and not all functions mentioned are available here. It is, though, a wonderful way to acquire knowledge and entertain at the same time."

    body: "This is a great article. Thanks very much.\r\nI currently have a Gentoo box at home that runs MythTV. I have 3 Hauppauge PVR cards. It works great. One of these days I may have to try this Freevo on another box to see how it compares. I really need to change this system from Gentoo though, as I find it difficult to use. Fedora seems like an option, but I've been hearing a lot of great things about Ubunutu.\r\n\r\nWhat do other readers here think about the various Linux distributions, primarily for a Media Centre?"

Also the Mythtv configuration guide has a lot of Mandriva specific stuff written into it.\r\nI'm running my MythTV backend on my main PC in our home office (to prevent too much noise in the living room, and because that allowed me to simply add a capture card to the machine and not having to acquire another machine), and view on the TV via my laptop (soon to be replaced by an Hauppauge MediaMVP). Otherwise, if I would have put everything on one and the same machine, dedicated as media centre, I would have chosen for Knoppmyth. Makes it even easier to install and configure."

    hostname: 213.235.202.36
    created: '1174673840'
    body: "You wrote: <cite>MythTV is a solid piece of software written in C++</cite>. My Question: What is your definition of \"solid\"? My opinion is that MythTV includes some nice ideas (seperation of frontend and backend, tv functions), BUT apart from that the architecture and stability is relativly bad. The source code is here and there really ugly. You also forgot to mention VDR which is the third (\"famous\") HTPC/TV-Project for Linux out there. I've tested MythTV and VDR - both didn't convince me (I expected a lot from MythTV), so I'm now experimenting with Freevo, which sure lacks a lot of features in comparison to MythTV, but I prefer the philospohy \"don't reinvent the wheel\" (MythTV people obviously don't know this principle).\r\n\r\nI also have a Matrox G400 and played a lot with. After many different configurations I can only suggest a DirectFB-solution (which MythTV doesnt support after version 0.19). The DirectFB-library has still the best support for the G400 and TV-OUT-setup is near \"configurationless\" (if you have an europeaon TV with SCART-interface i would suggest to build a VGA/SCART-cable). There are no brightness, nor resolution problems (as you mentioned in your article) with this solution.\r\n\r\nAs silent HW I could recommend either VIA Eden Mini-ITX motherboards or an AMD-Geode-Setup. The problem with the via-boards from my view: the tv-out is not as good as the g400-tv-out and the soundcard is also not better than common ac97. For an interesting geode-setup look here: http://bird.zero.ad.jp/~zas55369/geodenx.htm (i dont speak japanese, but the photos are pretty self-explaining). An affordable motherboard which supports the Geode-family is eg the ASRock K741GX."
