    subject: 'How to save thousands by using Linux'
    hostname: 198.54.202.194
    created: '1171446051'
    body: "We frequently forget the hidden benefits of Linux in these sorts of comparisons.  Most IT departments in large companies do have several Linux boxes stuck in corners doing vital functions for their departments.  But away from the big companies Linux is doing a fantastic job in the small / medium sized businesses!  In my workplace (a retail pharmacy) we now have 7 linux boxen and 1 Windows XP box due to legacy software from suppliers.  90% of support hassles are due to the one Windows box.  Linux runs and runs and runs and is a winner!  The hidden benefit of escaping the MS-imposed hardware upgrade cycle have saved hundreds of thousands over the past four years.  Downtime is virtually 1% of uptime and is limited to physical hardware issues where cables are severed, fans stop running, floppy disks are worn out etc.\r\n\r\n<strong>Continuous update cycle</strong>\r\n\r\nA very important consideration is the continuous update cycle of Linux. That is both the operating system as well as the applications. I am constantly discovering exceptional applications on Linux that really makes a difference to how I work. \r\nEvery few days there are new updates available. Thus, I have a system that remains up to date. Very few Windows users can make that claim!  Every six months or so a major new version of the Linux (I use (Ubuntu - there are other acceptable distros too!) becomes available. Thus in the past twenty months I have upgraded my system 4 times with a dramatic increase in productivity.  And hassle-free upgrades on top of it!\r\n\r\nConsider the Windows scenario: Purchase Win XP, purchase Office, purchase major graphic apps and development software. Eventually the budget is depleted, and copies of your friend's killer apps get loaded. Sometime the 'New Windows' comes along. You have a limited window period of upgrading, either you do so and spend more money, or you miss out on the ability to upgrade.\r\n\r\nFrom 1992 to 2002 I have spent more than ZAR 50,000 on software for the Windows platform. Money totally wasted! And eventually I ended up using mostly pirated software. I am now running great software, legally, and my budget covers education and hardware costs, and there is a continuous upgrade cycle ahead of me, legal, cost free, and again, this is really good stuff!\r\n\r\n<strong>Convenience of Linux</strong>\r\n\r\nI know, it gets boring, but the new Linux distros give the man in the street the opportunity to actually use Linux without having to fiddle with Linux all day. Virii, spyware, adware, malware does'nt hassle me, while >60% of Windows PC's are infected with some sort of malware. At work, (a retail environment) there are seven PC's. A few years ago all of them ran Windows. Now only one machine still runs Windows (the rest are Linux based: Suse, Ubuntu) and that single Winsux PC is a constant headache and a bottomless pit of support nightmares. The only time that I ever become aware of problems on the Linux boxen is when the hardware occasionaly packs up.\r\n\r\n<strong>Killer apps are not everything!</strong>\r\n\r\nYes, there are some Windows programs that I do miss dearly. But, there are Linux equivalents and I still get my work done, better, faster, cheaper. But Linux has alternates and you can get your work done.  And after three years I can say that I get more done on Linux apps than the Windows equivalents - it was not always the case, but there is a continuous upgrade and improvement cycle with Linux apps that simply don't exist in Windows unless you take out your checkbook yet again. I have crossed the divide, I have switched totally from Windows to Linux and I will never look back. It can be done! I have had problems, but nearly all problems have been resolved in the Ubuntu forums on the Internet in considerably less time than it would have taken to hold on for Microsoft support!\r\n\r\n<strong>Advantage of Open Systems</strong>\r\n\r\nWe recently started a subsidiary company. I needed business cards, invoices, letterheads, some custom spreadsheets, business plans etc. and it had to be done pronto. In ten minutes, after some Googling, I had downloaded a bunch of Open Office templates and within the hour everything was done. Now, I challenge anyone to achieve the same output in Microsoft Office, given triple the time and at any cost!\r\n\r\n<strong>Planned obsolescence contained in Windows</strong>\r\n\r\nOh yes, this is important: If we had to upgrade Windows on all our current PC's, we would have to chuck most of the hardware and buy new boxen. But Linux runs acceptably on all our existing hardware, and those machines will continue operating indefinately until the hardware gives in. The next version of Windows will probably require large-scale upgrades of hardware in many companies. I have escaped from the pathetic Windows upgrade cycle for good! Thanks Linux!"

There isn't a Windows client replacement for Outlook, let alone a Linux one; however, there are alternatives depending on your organizational needs.\"\r\n\r\nThat is a truth with modifications. I agree that the standard Evolution Exchange connector doesn't exactly make Evolution a feature-by-feature replacement for Outlook. This is due to technological limitation within WebDAV (OWA) as used by evolution-exchange. However, there is another Exchange connector for Evolution 2.4 or later. It is called evolution-brutus (e-b for short). \r\n\r\ne-b is effectively using native MAPI which is also the protocol used by Outlook. e-b therefore has the potential to become a feature-rich replacement for Outlook.

    body: "<strong>People do not value freedom</strong>. This is the problem. They would rather value convenience over freedom. Free Software has the potential to solve 100% of a user's requirements but work needs to be done to achieve that figure. People would rather invest their resources (time/money/man power) into functionally convenient non-Free software over improving an inadequate Free Software title and have complete control of the functionality of the final product.\r\n\r\nIn people's minds, moving to GNU/Linux is just like moving to any other non-Free OS. If the Free Software app doesn't do as user requires, it is inadequate. People stop at that point because they don't want to invest anything to getting free software apps to operate as required. Then they tell the world how they <em>\"tried to move to Linux but failed because A,B, and C were inadequate and therefore Linux is not suitable for purpose G\"</em>.\r\n\r\nSo when people ask me about Linux, I tell them about Free Software then say if you're not willing to invest the time/money/man power into getting your system to work, then stay with your current system. It will save us both a lot of time."

    body: "I think most people do value freedom, at least to some extent. If you took that statement at face value, that'd mean that no one would mind being a slave, which is obviously wrong. They often don't have a chance to value it when they try GNU/Linux because usually they aren't told that it offers them any more freedom than proprietary software. Often that's because it doesn't, because many of the distributions add proprietary software to it, so when the whole distro is taken as one, for example when it's on a single CD, they don't have any more freedom with it than with any other proprietary software.\r\n\r\nI started using 'Linux' for reasons other than freedom, because I didn't even know it gave me any, but when I read about it I gradually started learning that it's really GNU/Linux and that it was the idea of freedom that started it all, and now that's the reason I use it instead of proprietary software. Many people would like to be able to share their software with other people, judging from the significant amount who do that illegally, but as they aren't told by many people that there's alternative software which lets them do that legally, and so many people tell them that it's \"wrong\", they mostly just do it privately and secretively, or they're too scared to do it.\r\n\r\n--\r\nGNU - free as in freedom"

A number of my friends are in this situation: they 'pirate' copies of popular proprietary software and know the existence of Free software alternative and they almost always reject the Free alternative because it isn't as convenient as the proprietary app. \r\n\r\nThis leads back to my original sentiment about convenience and freedom - \"people don't value freedom enough to invest in freedom\". When people try Free software and it fails to meet their requirements, they see it as a sign that Free software is inadequate then stop there and return to their proprietary app that does provide their requirements rather than fixing up the Free Software title."

Where we need to get that average user to try a few options before settling in. I have nothing against people using Windows, I'd just like them to have an information and a chance to try several options. Here is where our average Linuxer comes into play.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that the average Linux user is not aware how easy in fact it is to convert a Windows user to Linux or to get a new user to use Linux from the start. There are many reasons and plenty of ways to introduce your potential convert to Linux in a slow and gradual manner. I have so far succeeded in 2 cases. Now this might sound as not much, but in fact it is a great deal.\r\n\r\nOne of the things that stand out is that I managed to do this without pressuring anyone. I just simply used the circumstances at hand which were: unwillingness to use pirated software in one case and desire for a better development environment in another.\r\n\r\nIf done wisely I believe all of us can take some scalp of our own. In due time numbers will start to accumulate. Some might say that this would be unneeded if Linux was such a good product on its own and that everyone would at least try it. However you must be aware that we are fighting a fierce and well funded marketing machinery that has infiltrated government ranks and large corporations. The only way to counter that is if Linux is great enough to generate a whole army of small zealots spreading it around. And, in my opinion at least, that is exactly what is going on right now.\r\n\r\nNow zealots usually have a way of driving people away from everything before they get a bit of smoothness and cleverness about their attempts.
