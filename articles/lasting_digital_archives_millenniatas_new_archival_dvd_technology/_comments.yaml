    body: "This sounds like a great idea to me, I have already myself lost data to faulty CD's that \"died\" after only 10 years (1997-2007). However I have one concern: \r\n\r\nGiven that the DVD gets physically etched with these pits, will it be more sensitive to scratches? I've noticed small surface scratches on the CD/DVD's that I use frequently. Or, like the dye CD/DVD's is this layer behind the \"bullet proof\" plastic that can be polished? "

    body: "It's underneath the plastic substrate. It's just like that trick where you pop a black balloon inside of a clear balloon using a laser -- the black balloon absorbs all the laser energy, while the laser goes right through the clear one without doing any damage.\r\n\r\nSame basic principle -- there's a data layer which is pitted by the laser. It actually forms a small gas pocket when it does this. Of course, it's not quite as neat looking as the pressed disks -- you can see that in the photomicrograph. But it's much more permanent than a purely chemical change as happens in dye-based disks.\r\n"

I need something that would last a good deal of time as I collect old music (Big band and earlier) among taking family photos and the such. \r\n\r\nIt would be nice to know that I can back up 88Gigs to disks that could hold that information for many years to come.
