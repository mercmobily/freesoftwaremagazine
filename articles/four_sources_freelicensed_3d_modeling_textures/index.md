This week I discovered some new resources for texture graphics to use in 3D modeling. Textures are essential for most 3D modeling projects of any complexity, and good textures can sometimes make very simple "low-poly" models look much better.

I just came across a post about different source materials for Blender modeling. The original included a lot of non-free materials, but along with it, I found some very nice sources for free-licensed textures:

[TextureMate](http://www.texturemate.com/) offers a larger, well-curated collection under the [CC By 3.0](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0) license. This is clearly the first place to look.

[AGF81/"Andi"](http://agf81.deviantart.com/) on [DeviantArt](http://agf81.deviantart.com/) is simply an artist who produces a lot of textures. So far as I can tell all or at least most of these are also offered under the [CC By 3.0](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0) license.

[Free Stock Textures](http://freestocktextures.com/) has another large collection. The license is not quite as clear, but I think it's compatible with reuse in free-licenses By or By-SA works: "All textures may be used for both personal and commercial purposes. You may make any derivative work out of them. However you are not allowed to sell or redistribute these textures in an underived form or if the modified product is a texture or a textures pack."

[Mayang](http://www.mayang.com/textures/) is a small collection of textures under a similar custom license which is probably compatible with use in By or By-SA works: "free to use for all uses, whether commercial or non-commercial (you may incorporate them into your derived work with no requirement to pay us any licensing fee etc). Your derived work must involve significant modification to the textures. It would be nice if you could credit us." There are terms intended to prevent them from being used by other stock texture sites for profit, but it appears not to create a problem for derived works.
