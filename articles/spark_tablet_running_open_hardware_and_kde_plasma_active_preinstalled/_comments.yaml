    body: 'Good article, thanks Gary. Many folks would be a lot more strict about the term <em>Open Hardare</em>. AFAIK the Raspberry Pi, Allwinner A10 Tablet, and even this Spark (now renamed due to trademark issues) are all well outside most definitions of open hardware. Would be curious to hear your view?'
