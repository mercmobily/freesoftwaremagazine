    body: "In Capitalism paradigmatic, all benefit to be achiev is money, or mataerial things. But actually money and material is not the only thing to hunt to. \r\nWe may have or get a psichological satisfaction by launching free software or book. The twoo kinds of things can be our faith, hope, and charity. \r\nThe Prophet Mohamad (pbuh) said: \"Mankind, After his/her death, the connection between him/her and this world is ended except three things: (1) our charity/fund to others, (2) our knowledge that's usefull for human life, and (3) sons/doughters that will pray for him/her. He/she will be always be able to take advantage of the three things....\".\r\nI think this is a universal value to be kept in mind and to be thinked over.\r\nSoo keep launching free software and keep writing new books without copywriting at all. That is our faith, hope and charity..."

    body: 'Hopefully, Microsoft will continue overlooking ''free software'' until its too late.  By "overlooking," I mean that Microsoft [Ms, hereafter] is really too busy trying to ''be all things to all people,'' instead of focusing on their ''core competency.''  In the case of Ms, B. Gates, et al, they''re not as concerned as they should be, because they''re continually trying to find something else to do, besides write code, upgrade & update programs, & improve the quality & security of their software.  As long as they stay focused on some silly ''strawman'' of their own making, fighting ''free software'' will remain a relatively insignificant part of their collective day.  So, let''s all encourage Bill, Steve, & all the rest to stay focused on ''search,'' the web, <strong> ANYTHING </strong> but free software!  Send ''em emails about how much you appreciate their efforts to improve online searching, how concerned you about protecting innovation, or how unfair the legal system is.  Hey, look at everything they''ve done in the past, then give ''em some ideas that will, hopefully, help them keep on being ''Ms''directed!'

    body: 'We know they understand and fear FOSS.  The Halloween Documents are a nice loooong "oh crap...they''re good at this software thing."  Let''s just keep making everyone aware that there <em>no reason</em> to <em>ever</em> pay a few hundred dollars for MS Office.  There''s OOo, and it''s MS Office compatible.  Every customer who asks "does this come with Word?" when buying a computer, I tell "no, but I can put a free office suite called Open Office on there.  It does the same stuff Office does, and it can use the same files."  When I see the overpriced office suites in stores, I sneer and say (not so quietly) "who''d pay for an office suite when you can get one free at openoffice.org?" and I''ve told people in another computer store, right after the sales guy was telling them how they get a 30 day trial of Office and can come back and pay a few hundred dollars for the full version, about OOo, and, as anyone who cares about his/her wallet, they, liked hearing they could save money.'
