Wow. I logged in to [Slashdot](http://slashdot.org/articles/06/04/13/045247.shtml) today and the first thing I saw was that [Google has released its new calendar](http://www.google.com/calendar/render). I noticed right away that this calendar allows imports from MS Outlook—one less excuse for people to cling to MS. I've tried various calendar apps within Firefox and Thunderbird, but this one appears as intuitive as Google's great Reader app. I wonder if any of this is making MS nervous?
