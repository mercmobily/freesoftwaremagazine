    body: "Hello Mr. Cheney(?)\r\n\r\nThis past week it was widely reported the government finally publicly admitted that major phone companies (ATT, Verizon, el al) had voluntarily opened up their networks to allow spying on them.\r\n\r\nThe Bush regime has a track record of breaking the law and then covering it up and lying about it.  And then when it's caught redhanded it claims it was done in the name of \"national security.\" The question then become which Nation. Certainly not This Nation which has a Constitution which prohibits this dictatorial declaration of Executive Authority, these officials allegedly take an oath to protect, uphold, and defend.\r\n\r\nBut Skype doesn't need to change the fundamentals of its P2P network to aide the government. All it has to do are things like the following:\r\n\r\n1) Allow tracking or tracing of calls through its P2P network by the government.\r\n\r\n2) Allow for PC-to-PC calls to have unencrypted channels so that they can be listened to, while the regular calls proceed encrypted as as normal to users, unknown to them.\r\n\r\n3) Allow the government to have access to Skype's users database.\r\n\r\n4) Allow the government to block certain calls from connecting, or to terminate then when the government wants.\r\n\r\n5) Allow the government to make calls to people at will, for nefarious reasons.\r\n\r\n6) Allow the government to have backdoor hooks into all future upgrades to Skpye's client software, and more importantly, to their server platforms.\r\n\r\nOnly fools, fellow fascists, or FUD fakes, would summarily believe, defend, or promote, ANYTHING this government would say about not spying on people, in the face of its clear and growing documented record of abuses.\r\n\r\nHow many people wanna bet that sometime in the not so far off future it will be revealed that Skype too had been compromised in some way by the government, or at their request?\r\n"

It is a excellent idea to consider how to better protect civil liberties using free software. Thanks for the links!'

For me FISA is just one more nail in the coffin for U.S. Foreign relations. Here in Europe, we don''t trust U.S. foreign policy any more. Over 60 years of loyalty between the E.U and U.S. have been undermined by Bush Sn and Bush jr treating every other nation like a small pet. U.S policy in Iraq has set up another century of civil war in Iraq. Time to stop acting like dictators.'

    hostname: 77.76.10.145
    created: '1189192158'
    body: "Skype relies on the fact that it uses a closed source protocol with a very tight control over the servers hosting the user db. Spying on calls is not really as easy as the article infers it to be but it is possible. If there is a direct route between 2 nodes then the connection is not routed through the skype servers. However, there is also the option of routing all the information through the skype servers or any server that pretends to be a skype one. Hence it is possible to use some NSA servers to in a way steal skype. This would be useful to collect information about who is talking with who and when and it's possible to even record the actual conversation. And the bad thing is that given enough resources and brain power you don't really need to ask ebay for a permission to do this. There is a research paper that was published not long ago explaining how this could be potentially done. (sorry I don't have the name of the author at hand ) The conclusion was that no regular user can do this in practice but then again NSA is not a regular user ... Of course without the legislation in place all intel collected is useless and moreover illegal. \r\n\r\nI don't really think that the NSA is spying on Skype or that my conversations are not private when I use skype. My gripe with Skype has to do with the huge memory footprint and the closed nature of the protocol. The fact that skype is the only network that I can't connect to with pidgin really bugs me and this is why i use skype only when I have no other choice. But if there was a deal between any security agency and ebay to spy on people the image of the company will not be hurt because the user will never know about it. No security agency is obligated to tell you if they are spying on you."
