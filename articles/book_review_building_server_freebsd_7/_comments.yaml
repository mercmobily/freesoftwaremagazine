    body: "Many thanks for the book, and the review ... while not wanted to start the old Linux vs whatever flame wars, I do have to say that FreeBSD (I'm not all that acquainted with NetBSD or OpenBSD) has become a very good friend after several dozens of servers and five years of fairly intensive use. Linux refers to a kernel, and everything around it can be quite chaotic with hundreds of distinct distributions based on that kernel. Not so with BSD ... a dedicated group of maintainers/committers ensures that FreeBSD releases (with the exception of some glitches around FBSD 5.X) are coherent and quality-oriented. One does have to take care with hardware, best to stay away from the bleeding-edge until the edge no longer bleeds...\r\n\r\nBut the best part about FreeBSD is its ability to completely rebuild itself from the inside-out. This can be accomplished via ssh login, making for extremely easy system upgrades handled remotely.\r\n\r\nFreeBSD has no high-profile funders a la Ubuntu, but I dare say its community is as fine and competent as exists in the open source world.\r\n\r\nAnd finally, its license is the most liberal of all. Its copyright fights are of the past, and its code is there for all to use as one sees fit, for profit or not. How can you beat that?\r\n\r\nIn short, I have nothing but praise for this opeating system and its community. There are perhaps twenty or more mailing lists specific to various aspects of FreeBSD.\r\n\r\nOh, lest I forget, there are many desktops/guis suitable for non-server use available via FreeBSD's really unbeatable ports/packages system. PC-BSD and DesktopBSD are versions that are ready-to-go, but rolling your own can be much more fun! Executing pkg_add -r kde3 will grab the whole environment and install it for you while you take a break, it's that easy. For those with powerful machines, cd'ing into /usr/ports/x11/kde3 and executing 'make install' will accomplish more or less the same thing but with a difference: the code will be custom compiled with the idiosyncracies of your specific machine and environment. And, one has greater control over the entire process!"
