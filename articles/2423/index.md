  From Friday June 29th to Sunday July 1st, FSFE held its annual  meeting of the  [General Assembly](http://fsfeurope.org/about/members) in  Brussels.  Starting at 10am each morning, we were in the meeting  room until 8pm, 10:30pm, and 5pm.  Being an employee, I was there as  a guest.

  In preparation for the meeting,  a [two year  executive summary](http://fsfeurope.org/documents/reports/es-2007) of FSFE's projects was published.

  On the Monday afterward, Sean Daly interviewed Georg Greve.  The  audio and a transcript  of [the  interview is on Groklaw](http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20070706093041808).  We had been trying to arrange that  interview all weekend, and Sean was always ready, but the annual  meeting was so draining that it kept being put off til the next day.

  While in Brussels, we  had [a  social event](http://fsfe.org/en/events/first_benelux_meeting_in_brussels) where we met with some of the Fellows from Belgium  and the Netherlands.  Before the weekend, some of us were saying it  was a pity not to organise a more formal event since so many  people of FSFE were present.  After the weekend, I realised that  it's just not possible to add more work to the schedule.  The social  event was just right.

  It was funny that the meeting coincided with the release  of [GPLv3](http://fsfeurope.org/projects/gplv3/).  This  was one of the biggest announcements of the year, but we were all  too busy and tired to be able to participate much.
