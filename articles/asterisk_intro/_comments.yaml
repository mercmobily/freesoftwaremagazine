    body: "you can assign leading digits to users. and make them different.\r\nThe problem with this is that you force users to press 1,2,3,4,..,9 before they start the real number. If you have lot of users, then give them 2 digits prefix. in your dial plan you can add the digits to ignore-path so asterisk keeps the dial tone up for the real numbers. Adding password will alienate your customers since you are asking them to enter a password all the time. Just remember to allow 911 (or equivalent) calls through without any password or prefixes."
