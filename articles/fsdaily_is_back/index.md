Hello, loyal readers and subscribers of Free Software Magazine. Free Software Daily, a news site that focuses exclusively on free software, is now here.


<!--break-->


Yes, that's right: we have a embarked on an exciting new project, and we want you all to be the first to know about it!

We couldn't help but notice the lack of news hub entirely dedicated to free software. Sure, there are other news hubs, but why shouldn't we have one where like-minded free software supporters can get together and share news and info without being bothered by those pesky Microsoft ads and yes-men?

So we made one of our own. That's right, FSDaily is back in action, this time set up using Pligg. So this will be like Digg but just for free software and with no FUD or MS fanboys. Plus, every single article that hits the homepage will be about free software (not just a few per day).

This is your chance to get in from the beginning, and be a part of something great. If you head to FSDaily now, you'll notice that we only have a couple of pages of news so far... that's because only a couple of people know about it! But it's not going to be a secret for long, so hurry on over to register now before the good usernames get taken.

Of course, this is a community driven website so please:


* Visit us at [www.fsdaily.com](http://www.fsdaily.com) and read the news your very own community considers important.
* Take the wheel and help decide what news is important. Create an account and vote! Remember, this is the power of pligg: you decide the important stories - what goes up... and down.
* Know a juicy piece of free software related news that isn't on FSDaily? Put it there! Let everyone know!
* Let us know what you think of FSDaily! We are making this site for you, the community members. If you have suggestions, or feedback, let us know, and we will respond to you.
* Let everyone else know what you think of FSDaily! Spread the word, on your blog or website, or just by word of mouth.
* And, link to us! Obviously, we want people who are looking for free software news to come to the site with the best selection and the highest quality stories, as voted by the people that know - you guys. Please put this URL in your blog or on your page, and help spread the word! [FSDaily.com - free software news for the free software community](http://www.fsdaily.com).

We look forward to reading your news... on FSDaily.com!
