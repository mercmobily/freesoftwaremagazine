Cry me a river. They need to adapt their model or die; horse and buggy builders had to do this when cars started becoming affordable for the multitudes.\r\n\r\n<cite> ...because the lack of direct revenue on developing free software makes it harder to make money out of developing such software.</cite>\r\nWhat? Red Hat, IBM, Novell, Sun and plenty of other companies seem to make a healthy profit from developing and supporting Free software. Though there are occurrences user subjugation involving non-Free software from these companies, the fact is, they get a direct revenue and healthy profit for developing free software.\r\n\r\n<cite>... then less people will be inclined to write software professionally. In turn, this will mean that end-users will have less high-quality software available.</cite>\r\nIf you don't have the resources (man-power, time, skill, ) to improve software for yourself or your organisation, then chances are, you need to hire a professional to do it for you. If your software was improved to work better for you by a professional that you paid, doesn't this mean that the software is professional high-quality software?\r\n\r\nBTW, I'm not directing this comment towards you, but to the people that make these claims. To me, they have invested too much time and mind power into the old and effective business model of subjugating their users through software for profit. I haven't seen many people of this category that truly understand Free software. Because of this, they will continue complain about getting less money and not change their ways of making money. While I hope that this business model will die, I don't see it happening in the near future while user subjugation remains profitable and they choose to not educate themselves about Free software."

[..] Additionally, of course, the fact that it's easier to generate revenue with proprietary software doesn't make it impossible to do the same with free software; examples can be found when looking at companies like IBM, Sun, and Red Hat, who do get some revenue from free software (although none of them provide free software exclusively)\"\r\n\r\nIn my opinion what is important when evalutating <a href=\"http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/commercial-floss.html\">commercial open source</a> viability is what <a href=\"http://econpapers.repec.org/article/eeerespol/v_3A34_3Ay_3A2005_3Ai_3A4_3Ap_3A481-493.htm\"> kind of relationships exists between the firm and the community</a>.\r\nIn this regard RH and Sun are known to have chosen the symbiotic approach, where others enjoy more a parasitic one.

    body: "So What???!  Maybe you should think a bit more about the consequences before advocating the scrapping of the economic model that has underpinned software development up to this point.  What is your summary opinion on globalization?  Is it good or bad or something a bit more complex?  In 100 years will we look back on the globalization experiment and see that it was the best way for humanity to develop?  Are you really sure about the FOSS business model or could it be that future reliance on non-professional software development somehow turn out bad?\r\n\r\nPerhaps what is needed is a middle way.  An open source model could be created where for-profit developers can restrict redistribution for a period of time (say 6 months).  This would allow them to offer subscription services which would replace the \"per copy\" model that is offered right now.  At the end of the six months the code would be relicensed under the GPL.  If the developer failed to offer sufficient value in their subscription service the older GPL version would fork and become the primary distribution.  If such a model existed surely more software would be free -- even if delayed just a bit.\r\n\r\nOf course, this wouldn't be the GPL.  People who have chosen the GPL don't want their code closed and their opinions should be respected.  \r\n\r\nWe shouldn't just close our eyes and hope for the best.\r\n\r\nTJ"

    body: "It's important to remember that the model you describe for software development has existed for only about 30-35 years. For a good 20 years before that, software was dominated by an essentially free, academic development model (what you might call a patronage model -- software development was primarily paid for by university and government research projects).\r\n\r\nDuring the 30 years or so that proprietary, closed source software dominated the software marketplace, development continued, but it's questionable whether it kept up the pace that free software development did during the same interval.\r\n\r\nAs a comparable, the Windows codebase apparently dates to about the mid 1980s, whereas Linux was created essentially from a standing start in 1991. Both operating systems had the benefit of the non-copyleft free-licensed BSD Unix operating system, so that does not explain any handicap for Windows.\r\n\r\nToday, which system is more mature: the 20+ year old system developed according to the prevailing proprietary model or the 16 year old free software operating system? In terms of number of bugs, security holes, flexibility, and robustness of design it would be pretty hard to pick Windows.\r\n\r\nIMHO, this by itself demonstrates the superiority of the free development model, but there are many other arguments as well.\r\n\r\nThe main article is simply articulating the entrepreneurial economics concept of \"creative destruction\": a new business model will inevitably cause destruction of existing businesses which do not adapt, but that's just the nature of a free market. When you create an efficient new way to do things, you destroy the inefficient old way.\r\n\r\n<em>Many</em> corporate complaints about the free market reduce to a failure to accept that creative destruction is good for society as a whole (note that this is <em>not</em> the \"broken window fallacy\", despite somewhat similar terminology).\r\n"
