Two major Perl events will take place in Italy, thanks to the effort of the [Italian Perl users](http://www.perl.it/) and the [Pisa.pm](http://pisa.pm.org) users group.

Here are the details!

# Italian Perl Workshop

The first event is the [fifth Italian Perl Workshop](http://conferences.yapceurope.org/ipw2009/index.html), that will take place in Pisa, Italy, on October 22nd and 23rd. It's a **free event**, although registration is needed.

While the Workshop is mainly aimed at an Italian audience, the international public will surely enjoy the talks of well known speakers like [Tim Bunce](http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/au/653), [Thomas Fuchs](http://script.aculo.us/thomas/), [Amy Hoy](http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/os2007/view/e_spkr/2740), [Dave Rolsky](http://www.houseabsolute.com/resume.html) and [Jonathan Worthington](http://www.jnthn.net/).

Dave Rolsky will give a [World Class day's training](http://conferences.yapceurope.org/ipw2009/news/439) on [Moose](http://www.iinteractive.com/moose/) on October 21, 2009 (the day before the conference). This mini-course will be a paid event, and will be expressly for the purpose of covering Dave's flight to Europe and hotel expenses. The cost for person is likely to be around EUR 100, with a maximum of 25 participants.

Check the [Workshop site](http://conferences.yapceurope.org/ipw2009/index.html) for more information. Book your flight (and your place at Rolsky's class) now!


# YAPC::EU 2010

The YAPC::Europe Foundation has [announced](http://www.yapceurope.org/news.html#20090803) a few weeks ago that it has chosen Pisa to host YAPC::Europe 2010. The conference theme is "the Renaissance of Perl".

[YAPC::EU](http://www.yapceurope.org/events/conferences.html), or "Yet Another Perl Conference" is an international event, which takes place each year in a different European city.

Ten cities and seven European countries have hosted YAPC::EU so far. [YAPC::EU 2009](http://yapceurope2009.org/ye2009/) took place in Lisbon, Portugal, in August, featuring [six tracks and a load of talks](http://yapceurope2009.org/ye2009/talks), many of them held by well-known personalities of the Perl Community. Just skim the list to know what to expect in the next edition!
