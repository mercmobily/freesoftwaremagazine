    body: "I don't have a problem with Microsoft ending out Vista machines for write-ups. I agree that everything must be transparent, but is it Microsoft's fault if the blogger fails to disclose how he got the machine? In this case, it seems that Microsoft isn't the one breaking the code of conduct, it's the bloggers who fail to provide full disclosure. What was Microsoft to do, send out a massive press release listing all the people to whom it sent these Vista laptops?\r\n\r\n-Chris Karr \r\nwww.aetherial.net / books.aetherial.net"

    body: 'The problem is not that MS sent these computers out to the bloggers; the problem is that it was never mentioned that these were "review" PCs. In fact, one blogger stated that the original information he received specifically called the computer a "gift". Of course when all the negative press started, he was contacted again to say that it was for "review" and had to be returned or given away when he was finished.'

Linux was getting the heap ,no doupt about it !.\r\nrecently all labs running windows xp ,as always :(.\r\n\r\nMS gaint is also targeting curopted governments , as promoting the E-goverment sh**t , how come a country with more 40% of it's population under the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty_line\">poverty line</a> runs windows on government offices WHILE THERE IS A FREE ALTERNATIVE ?"
