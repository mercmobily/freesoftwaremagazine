    body: "Until this net neutrality issue is resolved favorably, as they might get it wrong the first time, I have been voting with my feet and my wallet. I've changed ISPs to find one that doesn't screw around like Verizon and their ilk. I've asked the ISPs if they have any limits, restrictions, or other sillybuggers with respect to bandwidth and different treatment between corporate accounts and regular Joe-bag-of-doughnut user accounts, and I give my business and my money to the ISP that doesn't play favorite or sillybuggers with their bandwidth.\r\n\r\n(As an added bonus, I have a static IP address on an account that costs less than Verizon's crappy dynamic IP address)\r\n\r\nSome of the game developers are starting to take notice of Linux as a viable market games, and are starting to write native-Linux versions of their games. I think that the rest of the industry, in particular the ISPs must be made aware of Linux and the bandwidth need for Linux.\r\n\r\nThe rational free-market solution would be for Google, Verizon, and the rest to realize that it is a bad idea to screw around with the bandwidth. While the big corporate accounts may bring in buckets of money, the sysadmin whose personal account is throttled may, and should, start pushing the corporate account to use another ISP that doesn't screw around, since the big corporate accounts are just a bunch of people with individual accounts that may have been harshed by the corporation's ISP.\r\n"
