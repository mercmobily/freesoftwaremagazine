    body: "A better solution would be using sed (with the '-i' option) instead of Gedit. Also, if you combine it with find (with '-exec' or with xargs), you can automate the whole process completely in one line. No need to apply it to each file manually.\r\n\r\nAnother thing, instead of relying on 'southeast' having a space after it, you can use '\\b', which matches a word boundary even if it's not followed by a space (for example, in \"southeast, southwestern, or southern\", your method won't work). '\\b' is available in Perl and GNU sed, but I don't know about grep or other sed implementations."

    body: "Hi, imgx64.\r\n\r\nsed wasn't an option, and neither was automating that particular process. As I mentioned in the note, I had to scan the grep results to see where and whether that replacement was appropriate. I wasn't replacing every instance of the searched-for string, just selected ones, something that I often do in webpage edits. I've done sed replacements and found I'd messed up strings that should have been left alone!"
