It's just a relic from the old tape drive days, and has no place in a desktop computer (a server, maybe). Can I suggest that in a future issue you highlight Gobolinux, perhaps reprinting this article by one of the developers:\r\n\r\nhttp://gobolinux.org/index.php?lang=en_US&page=doc/articles/clueless\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr/>\r\n\r\n<strong>From</strong>: edi weissmann \r\n<strong>Url</strong>: \r\n<strong>Date</strong>: 2006-01-17\r\n<strong>Subject:</strong> another reason would be...\r\n\r\n\r\n... the fact that some hardware vendors don't even bother to write drivers for linux. maybe if linux was more popular, and missing linux drivers would interfere with their sales, they would start having second thoughts.\r\n\r\n<hr/>\r\n\r\n<strong>From</strong>: Philippe ROUBAL \r\n<strong>Url</strong>: http://3d-synthesis.com\r\n<strong>Date</strong>: 2006-02-16\r\n<strong>Subject:</strong> I had to forget Linux because of the lack of drivers too\r\n\r\n\r\nHi!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWorking in electronics, and using a lot of various unusual peripherals like Micro controllers and Memory programmers, as well as more classical (printer, scanner, graphic tablet,...), I tried quite every distribution of Linux (red Hat, Mandrake Discovery, Suse 9.0, Fedora Core2, and much more), and each time I had to give up and go back to Windows because I couldn't find some drivers for several of my daily working tools...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<hr/>\r\n\r\n<strong>From</strong>: njvlkew \r\n<strong>Url</strong>: \r\n<strong>Date</strong>: 2006-02-17\r\n<strong>Subject:</strong> Re:I had to forget Linux because of the lack of drivers too \r\n\r\n\r\nHow about you consider using more modern versions of distros? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYour point becomes VERY weak when SUSE is now ver 10.0 and heading to 10.1 (Beta versions already out), while you're still using 9.0...There must be heaps of things you're missing. Same with Fedora. You're using Core 2, when the current one is Core 4. (and test versions of Core 5 are available).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is like saying you don't think Windows is working for you because you're basing your experience with Windows 98, when the current version is Windows XP!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI've installed quite a few distros on my ThinkPad. I have no problems with video card drivers (Ati Mobility Radeon 7500), Canon Digital Camera, my web cam, my HP Multifunction AND HP Color LaserJet, and my USB external HDD.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn fact, I'm starting to learn Python with it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI don't think Klik is the answer for me. In fact, it doesn't work for me at all, especially with FlightGear (open-source, OpenGL flight sim). It works when I install components in myself (boy, that was painful! But a good learning experience). It may work for you, but I just blew away 100MB of my web usage on something that didn't work \"the easy way\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRegards.\r\n\r\n<hr/>\r\n\r\n"
