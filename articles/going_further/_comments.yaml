    body: "Thanks for the review, we're aware of the state of our documentation and engagement with the Community, we're working on fixing both.  While Zenoss is still a fairly small company, I was hired just a few months ago to help keep them responsive to the needs of our users and to breakdown our roadblocks to adoption.  There has been a lot of recent work on documentation and we just put out a new 2.2.3 release of Zenoss this past week (http://www.zenoss.com/download/links).  We're working on improving the quality of our documentation (and reducing the redundancy) and the website will be making some big changes for our Community soon.  Thanks again for the feedback, we're working to continue improving the product and to satisfy our new and existing users.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nMatt Ray\r\nZenoss Community Manager\r\ncommunity.zenoss.com\r\n"
