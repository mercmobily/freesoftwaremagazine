Latest content
--------------

**pam prevention with Exim and greylistd - Part 1** --By Ryan Cartwright. Traditional methods of spam protection involve using Bayesian detection rules (usually via SpamAssassin) on messages after they have been accepted by your server. [Read more...](http://www.freesoftwaremagazine.com/columns/spam_prevention_exim_and_greylistd_part_1)

**The Bizarre Cathedral - 22** --By Tony Mobily and Ryan Cartwright. Latest from the Bizarre Cathedral. [Read more...](http://www.freesoftwaremagazine.com/columns/bizarre_cathedral_22)

** The Large Hadron Collider switches on. If it's the end of the world, it will be powered by GNU/Linux** --By Gary Richmond. You know a science story is big when an experiment gets first or second billing on the main evening news—and it’s not even a slow news day. The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is up and running as I write and as far as I can tell I’m still here, so it looks like the doomsayers were a little premature.

**Copyleft has no impact on project activity?!** --By Terry Hancock. Recently, I collected some data from Sourceforge, hoping to find evidence for the importance of copyleft. But I found something surprising: although there’s plenty of evidence that many developers believe in the power of copyleft, the one measure I could derive of how much copyleft actually works showed that copyleft made no difference whatsoever! If true, this means a lot of free software’s social theory is wrong and many things will have to be re-thought.

**Stephen Fry wishes GNU/Linux a happy 25th birthday** --By Terry Hancock. I was surprised and delighted to find this video presentation by one of my favorite performers, Stephen Fry, called “Happy Birthday to GNU”, on the GNU project homepage. [Read more...](http://www.freesoftwaremagazine.com/columns/stephen_fry_wishes_gnu_linux_happy_25th_birthday)

**Linux: has the horse bolted?** --By Laurie Langham. Richard Stallman wants to popularise the term GNU/Linux instead of using the currently popular term Linux. He correctly states that the term Linux, besides being thoroughly inaccurate, totally fails to introduce new users to the legal and philosophical concepts that underlie the basis of the GNU/Linux OS; but is it feasible to make such a change at this late stage?

**The Bizarre Cathedral - 21** --By Ryan Cartwright and Tony Mobily. Latest from the Bizarre Cathedral. [Read more...](http://www.freesoftwaremagazine.com/columns/bizarre_cathedral_21)

**Six impossible things before breakfast** --By Terry Hancock. Most of the assumptions on which our present economic system is based are based on nothing much better than “conventional wisdom”: which is a fancy way of saying “no basis at all, really, it just sounds plausible”. But sometimes conventional wisdom is wrong, and that’s what this series has been about: six things that ought to be impossible if conventional wisdom were correct.

**Google's Chrome, Mozilla, Explorer, rendering engines: let the war begin** --By Gary Richmond. Chrome is in fact a reference to the imminent release of Google’s entry into the browser market. Apparently, the launch was accidentally “leaked” by a Google employee who was a little piggy fingered with the send button on his e-mail client.
