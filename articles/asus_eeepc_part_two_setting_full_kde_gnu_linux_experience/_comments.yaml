    body: "Hey Gary!\r\n\r\nI'm Daniil Kulchenko, the creator of http://pafl.portools.com/. First of all, thanks for the link! I really appreciate it. Second, I am currently working on a new project that will provide Portable Applications for Linux, software that can run off of USB drives. Once the project is available (first programs available around late May 2008), I can notify you via a comment. It will be located at http://www.portools.com/. Thanks again for the link. It won't be inactive for long!"
