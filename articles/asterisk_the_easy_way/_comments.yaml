If I were looking for something that is baked and ready to go, I would go with Asterisk, AsteriskNOW, Trixbox, or one of the many derivative works long before I would waste my time on not fully baked projects...'

This is the first time that I've seen everything explained for technical users who don't necessarily have a background in tel-com.\r\n\r\nWould it be possible to include an example of using an alternative trunking for external calls. A lot of asterisk users are purely VOIP since the PSTN interface hardware costs money. An example using IAX2 trunking would be fantastic.\r\n\r\nKeep up the excellent work!\r\n\r\nH"
