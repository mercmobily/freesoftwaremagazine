    body: "I have pretty much the same system as that (except the motherboard is a Gigabyte one, not Asus - but the same chipset). You ARE right in what is important, but some things you disregard are actually important.\r\n\r\nIt doesn't matter which slot you plug your RAM in: not true. You should be careful about inserting your RAM sticks on coupled ports (some motherboard won't accept to run similarly sized RAM sticks in single channel mode - all right, that's more of a problem with Intel chipsets), and preferably using the 0-2 couple (in opposition with the 1-3 couple) as some BIOSes may get cranky after a while, forcing a CMOS reset.\r\n\r\nI would also recommend plugging the RAM in before you put the CPU cooler: recent ones are hefty, and have the RAM sticks positioned quite close - you may damage your RAM stick if it slips and hits the cooler's fins, for example. Also, aftermarket coolers are huge beasts, that can make inserting the RAM a problem.\r\n\r\nModern CPUs (AMD Athlon64, Athlon II, Intel Core) can handle running fanless for a little while: they contain electronics that WILL either throttle them to lower power states or just shut them down on overheating. You should ensure that your BIOS doesn't just switch off the fan if the CPU temperature is lower than 35Â°C (as mine does), or you'll find yourself trying to fix a fan that works perfectly :p\r\n\r\nThat means that on your smoke test, you should first go to the BIOS, look up the power saving and power management settings before you start to panic (one setting to check is that Cool'n'Quiet/speedStep is enabled, the others are the min/target/max temperatures allowed for the CPU fan), and ensure that when you do that, your system doesn't start... smoking.\r\n\r\nAlso, I would recommend doing two smoke tests:\r\n - one with only RAM, CPU+cooler plugged in: if it fries, you may want to not lose your disks and extension cards...\r\n - one with everything plugged in: if the first works and the second fails, it'll be much faster to debug.\r\n\r\n---\r\nA computer is like air conditioning: it becomes useless when you open windows."

    body: "Well, here I'm talking about one specific motherboard, not giving general advice, but your points are pretty good in general.\r\n\r\nI'm not so sure about the 2nd smoke test -- both because motherboards incorporate a lot of isolation circuitry for peripheral devices and because those devices are generally running at considerably higher power (current draw) than the motherboard. Normally, the problem is that an electromechanical peripheral device (like a disk drive) might overload the MB, not the other way around.\r\n"

    body: "As in, a disk drive could screw up the mobo because it's damaged - if you can boot a 'naked' system, then further failures will come from peripherals - it's a rather safe (not 100% sure, but still) bet.\r\n\r\nNow, if for some reason your mobo short circuits (it DOES happen), it may fry the drives' electronics (those work on 5V - it's pretty much the motor alone that works with the 12V lines) - as such, I personally put together a \"shoebox\" system (motherboard put on insulated material with CPU, RAM and HSF and PSU plugged into it), test it once, then put together the machine fully.\r\n\r\nIt is also a good way to ensure your heat sink is properly mounted: you can look at it from all directions, tinker with the wires while the system is live, etc. All stuff that is hard to do once mounted in the case.\r\n\r\nI agree that if you're in a hurry, cramming all the stuff inside the case and switching it on more often than not works on the first try, and you'll encounter no problem afterwards. But, talking from experience,the five minutes you may waste on the first smoke test (on hardware you haven't tried yet; on hardware I know works properly, I just don't care) may save you several hours down the road.\r\n---\r\nA computer is like air conditioning: it becomes useless when you open windows."
