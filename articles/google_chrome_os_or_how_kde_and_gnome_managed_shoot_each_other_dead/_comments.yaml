Who REALLY cares about the way things work.  What the vast majority of unwashed users want is for the damned thing TO work.  You want to come in, turn it on, and then you go do your thing.  \r\n\r\nIf you asked me what I REALLY want, I want to turn on my system with a button.

You will never be able to run GnuCash on Chrome OS, unless you create a version that has a web interface or is built using javascript so that it can run inside the browser.\r\n\r\nTo go from describing Chrome OS as not using KDE or Gnome to saying that KDE and Gnome are now somehow irrelevant is strange to say he least. Chrome OS no more needs KDE or Gnome than does your set top box or router. It will boot straight into the browser. There is no \"desk top\"; there is no ability to start multiple programs; there is no need for programs to interact. The only reason for Linux at all is to abstract away the differences in hardware.\r\n\r\nI really do not understand why having choices within Linux is considered \"crazy\". Does anyone complain that there are too many different soft drinks, or too many varieties of bread, or too many different wines? I like to have my Red Hat Enterprise for the backend servers, (or SuSE if I need to interact with Microsoft), Ubuntu for the desktop, Mint for the media machine, and Fedora for my bleeding edge development. It would be annoying to have to pick just one.\r\n\r\nIf Chrome OS is not embraced by the Linux community it will be because its philosophy is so opposite to the concept of Free Software. It is hard to understand why someone writing for the Free Software Magazine would miss this point. The point of Free Software is that the user has control because she has access to the source code for the applications. With Chrome the user has not only lost that access, they no longer have a copy of the software binary or control of their own data!\r\n\r\nIn the domain of information, it is actually hard to imagine something more evil than to take away a user's control to the extent that Chrome OS will.\r\n\r\n"

There are of course plenty of other desktop environments and window managers around. ;)\r\n\r\nAlso you seem to speak as if there is a somebody who could decide who would win the \"desktop environment war\". As you know - there isn't. The (I think cool) thing about free software options is that the users decide. The best* stuff should rise to the top so when you get two very string competing products it is because there are two very strong - sometimes competing - communities that use and want them. Yes GNU/Linux could have a de-facto DE in the same way that it has a de-facto C compiler or shell environment but with a DE the arguments becomes a little hazy. Choice *is* good - even where it seems to have shot the underlying products in the foot.\r\n\r\nComplaints about packaging, libraries and user-app locations should really be pointed at the distribution providers not an impersonal collection of software. As ocratato says, Chrome OS will be a browser-based environment. For that purpose most of the \"apps\" used on it will be browser-based web-apps. Libraries become very irrelevant in that case. This is the turnkey solution that is for the netbooks and home PCs of the world. It fits where Android doesn't but I'm not sure it's intended to end up on an OS where development is done or high-end graphic work or music production. It is in those environments that a larger more complex desktop environment fits. Remember Sun's \"Java OS\"? This coudl well be what that promised to be. Training environments, libraries, internet cafe's, \"basic\" home users can all benefit from this kind of system.\r\n\r\nBut in spite of all that, I'd be pretty (nay *very*) peed off if \"somebody\" decided *for me* which desktop environment was best and thus which one I must use. That's one of the reasons I left the proprietary world behind. Choice is only ever any use to me if I get to make my *own* choices.\r\n\r\ncheers  \r\nRyan  \r\n\\-\\-  \r\nEquitas IT Solutions - fairness, quality, freedom  \r\nhttp://www.equitasit.co.uk\r\n\r\n_\\* of course \"best\" here usually means most well publicised - as it does in other situations_\r\n"

    body: "Whoa, Tony, in one article, you managed to get wrong at least 3 fundamental things, and ranted weirdly about a bunch of others! This is so sad, provided that you are founder and Editor in Chief of Free Software magazine :(.\r\n\r\n1. Chrome is NOT GNU/Linux. Android is not GNU/Linux, neither is Chrome. In business term, they have totally different target markets, totally different feature/benefit sets, built with totally different goals in mind. GNU/Linux aims to be a full-fledged system on your computer, regardless if the computer is PC, server, laptop, etc. Chrome is built to be a netbook OS. Trying to matching features between them is like saying, \"if your oranges are red, I would have sold them together with my apples! And your oranges would have been way more popular, so please paint them red\". Different, see?\r\n\r\n2. Even if they are the same, Google would NOT use either KDE or GNOME anyway. First, each of these packages are 200+MB, with hefty requirements on term of hardware (these requirements are on par with Windows and Cocoa; they are a slightly lower, but the margin is not that significant). Remember the market that Google aims at: netbooks, with weak CPU, modest RAM, little hard drive, and feeble graphic cards. GNOME/KDE on there would be like Windows 95, which is ugly as pre-historic. No, Google would not sell that. If Google used an existing technology, it would have been something like XFCE, or even lighter like FWVM or Enlightenment (Samsung invests here!).\r\n\r\n3. The existence of multiple window managers are ESSENTIAL to the concept of Free Software. If Free Software gives you virtually no choices, no personalization, no right to vote for suitable programs, how can you call it \"free\"? Seriously. I use neither, for one, and I do know of many friends who explore different window manager. Furthermore, having one more choices is crucial. For example, Microsoft is invading GNOME with .NET junks. How to respond? Well, switch to KDE :D. Simple and easy. Let's assume that there was only The One GUI, and someone (not necessarily Microsoft; US government would serve just as well) invaded it, what would we do? First panic (yes, people do that with Mono). Then, flame ware. Then, screaming up and down while everyone still use dangerous components, since there is no replacement. Then, replacement will be written (remember the beginning of GNOME? KDE was a bitch back them, eh?). The existence of multiple window managers, thus, is inevitable and necessary.\r\n\r\n4. Trying to push out one-program-for-everything is absurd and ignorant. For example, how many file managers are there on Windows? No fewer than 5. True, only one is widely used (Windows Explorer), but yes, there are others. How many music players are there? How many libraries are there? How many programs that do exactly the same thing are there in Windows? True, it has one kernel and GUI subsystem; that counts TWO of unique software. TWO. While there are a trillions of different programs duplicating each other. TWO. What's what that? How can Windows be popular with so much duplication? It is time to rethink the reasons why GNU/Linux have not had more than 10% of the market share. No, it is not about duplication, as any other serious systems have multiple of these. I believe it is more in education, marketing, and software quality. Trying to throw these away to copy a small part of Windows or Mac OS, the least desirable part, is absurd and suicidal, I believe.\r\n\r\nBack to Chrome OS. True, it is new, it's from Google, it's excited. Except that it is super dangerous (cloud computing in general is), and it is totally different from GNU/Linux. Can we, thus, stop those weird comparisons? Thank you!"

As to whether GNOME and KDE shot each other (and in the process the GNU/Linux desktop) dead, I think that would be entirely worth considering separately from ChromeOS itself.\r\n\r\nAs to whether ChromeOS is a GNU/Linux, assuming for the moment it has a Linux kernel and core GNU userland, it could well \"technically\" be so, even if offering such a radically different vision, and one that I do happen to think fundamentally conflicts with the most basic premises of free as in freedom computing.

At some tasks it is even faster than my main desktop (AMD64 3200+ with 2 GB RAM) such as JavaScript execution in Firefox/Vimperator 3.5.\r\n\r\nNetbooks are not feeble. The only thing feeble about them is the crappy OS that most come preinstalled with, which is usually Windows or some Linux that has been butchered beyond recognition by the device manufacturer. Replace that with a proper OS and your netbook can do just as much as your desktop or laptop."

Thus I don't see what impact the Gnome-KDE-divide might have had for the design of Chrome OS.  The Google team made it pretty clear that they don't intend to allow any other than web applications - in the end Chrome OS is meant for low-end mobile computers used by non-geeks.  Google won't be forced to accept executables on the system simply because they don't intend to sell Chrome OS. After all they are a company which monetizes web services.  As things stand now, there will be enough room next to Chrome OS for Gnome and KDE -- and Windows and MacOS for that matter.  Whether we still have a full-blown desktop system in every household in ten years, on the other hand -- who knows?  That depends very much on broadband connectivity and pricing.  In my experience, most home users don't need photo editing beyond PicasaWeb for example, or text editing beyond Google Docs.  What they need however is portability and mobility - like visiting the family on Thanksgiving, showing them the latest photos and don't even bother to pack the computer or thumbdrive because they could easily access their stuff from a net appliance over there (without downloading anything permanently!). \r\n\r\nAs for GnuCash, have you tried http://www.mint.com/?\r\n\r\n"

Since Google is backing it, it probably won't die out, and some developers will probably \"cleave to it\" out of respect for Google. But others will be repelled by a system controlled by a single corporation -- it won't be \"free enough\".\r\n\r\nI don't necessarily accept the objection that Chrome is only a platform for a browser -- while that's clearly what it is now, it's very likely that it will be extended (at least, it will if Google releases the source code).

This diversity is a great strength because you can build a free Unix out of pretty much any combination you need. One size does not fit all. Even if a single desktop was a good idea, how are you going to enforce it? This is free software, anyone can write a new one, and anyone can fork this one-desktop-to-rule-them-all. Having multiple desktops not only gives competition and diversity of use, but it enforces modularity, abstractions and standards to keep it all working together. Which makes it more robust and flexible. One of the reasons Wine, and Windows itself, have problems running Windows software is that most of the time there is only one implimentation of the API, on one platform, so bugs and quirks go unnoticed and by the time a new implimentation comes along, the people with the source don't care enough to fix it.\r\n\r\nThen there is the effect on people, it's not like desktops are that different, being exposed to multiple kinds of desktop enables people to see through to the fundamentals. If there have only ever seen one desktop, they are going to just freak out when they see another with even really looking at how it's much the same. The whole idea of a single Linux desktop can go in the bin marked \"broken Windows thinking\", along with a stable kernel interface.\r\n\r\nGoogle have their own desktop, because they have different requirements than the existing desktops.\r\n\r\nBut I see Chrome OS as the return of the thin client, and it's insane in the mainframe, insane in the brain, and it belongs in the 50s.
