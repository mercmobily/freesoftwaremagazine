I was surprised and delighted to find this video presentation by one of my favorite performers, Stephen Fry, called "Happy Birthday to GNU", on the [GNU project](http://www.gnu.org) homepage. 

Posted on September 1st, in honor of GNU's 25th anniversary, it turns out to be only the latest in a series of entries on Mr. Fry's official [blog site](http://stephenfry.com/blog/) praising the virtues of free software.

[VIEW](http://www.gnu.org/fry/) on GNU website, or [DOWNLOAD](http://www.gnu.org/fry/happy-birthday-to-gnu-download.html) video from GNU website.

The video is (appropriately) in Ogg Theora format, a video codex which is free of patent problems and supported by free-licensed video players, including [VideoLAN Client](http://www.videolan.org/) (also known as "VLC"). Because this format is not yet as ubiquitous as various closed formats, your browser may not be configured to play it directly (which requires a plugin), but I had no problem playing the downloaded file in both VLC and Kaffeine.

[Stephen Fry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Fry)  has appeared in numerous films and television series, including [Jeeves and Wooster](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeeves_and_Wooster) and [A Bit of Fry and Laurie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Bit_of_Fry_and_Laurie) , and is particularly noted for his comedic roles and writing.
