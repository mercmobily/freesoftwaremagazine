As you know I draw/produce the Bizarre Cathedral cartoon strips for Free Software Magazine. Lately you may have noticed it's slowed to a bit of a crawl and almost a halt. This is just to let you know that tBC has not ended and is forthcoming. Unfortunately I've had some personal stuff which has taken up more of my time than I wished.

It's okay, nobody is ill, it's just that I am running out of hours in the day. Added to that the next strip is the 100th and obviously such a landmark strip deserves a little more attention than normal.

So thanks for your patience and please bear with me a bit longer.

thanks  
Ryan
