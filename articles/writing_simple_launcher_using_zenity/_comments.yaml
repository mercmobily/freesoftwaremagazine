    body: "Problem: If you have a level of technical ability to configure this, you don't need the 'simplicity' or 'convenience' it provides.\r\n\r\nIMO, a file-system if used as intended with directory structure is perfectly capable of storing information in a meaningful manner. The issue isn't cross-platform. The issue is showing the larger community how to store and archive files such that they can be easily retrieved sans search features.\r\n\r\nThe more we make the means for people to interact with a file-system the more we rely on dumbed down interfaces within which to access them.\r\n\r\nNote, I'm not staunchly promoting that we all use the terminal to access files and applications, merely that each sensible environment provides a file manager, through which we can access files easily providing some form of meaningful system of cataloging has been made, vs dumping important files with junk in the desktop, or the other extreme allowing an OS to decide where the files should go - as in the arbitrary way some make media folders for music, that don't work like traditional folders (try moving files around manually, repeatedly inside of Windows 7's Music \"Library\", windows will decide that you don't need directories -- sometimes.\r\n\r\nThus the creation and failure of relational file systems, they act as arbitrary things in the middle between a users files and the user and are also subject to radical change on an ongoing basis. in stark contrast, once we learn how to store files in a directory structure such that an entire organization, or family can access files quickly - with a little prior education, that methodology will be relevant for many generations of OS past present and future.\r\n\r\nFeel free to challenge my bigoted belief: what's the use in further simplifying and obscuring a user's data when operating systems at their core provide all that we need?\r\n"

    body: "Interesting point of view. I once had an 'Active' folder in which I kept the files I now list in the launcher described above. It had the advantage that my daily backups were only of that 'Active' folder, since usually nothing else had changed on my hard drive.\r\n\r\nI no longer have that folder. Instead, my frequently accessed files (12-15 of them, not the 4 shown in the illustration above) are back in a logically organised folder structure. I now do daily backups with rsync, so it doesn't matter what's changed and what hasn't: rsync will figure that out.\r\n\r\nThe big advantages for me of the favourites launcher over the 'Active' folder idea are first, that I can order the links in the launcher the way I want. If the frequency of access for a file changes, I can bump it up or down in the list easily.\r\n\r\nThe second advantage is that I find the 'unstable' part of the list easier to deal with than in a file manager. For a few days at a time I might need fast access to some files that normally sit dormant on the hard drive. Putting links to those files in the launcher, then deleting them, is easier for me than creating links to those files in my file manager, or shifting the files to a special folder.\r\n\r\nI'd say it's a matter of personal choice!"
