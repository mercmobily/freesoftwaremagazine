I have been increasingly impressed by the attitude of cooperation extended by the Free Software communities.  I am nearly overwhelmed when I compare the attitudes of huge proprietary system producers with that of any open source producer. \r\n\r\n   It took me about a month of being in the open source world to find and become involved with the community.  There are of course some exceptions but in general I was made to feel welcome and quickly assimilated into the group.   A complete reversal of the \"allowed\" looking over the fence at a knowledge base to being greeted personally and invited into the community.\r\n\r\n  I have, like you, have a global conversation that has torn down prejudices and misconceptions. This alone would have justified my move to open source. \r\n\r\nFewClues"

See my avatar - The Blue Marble :-) Of course, I can't deny that I'm influenced by my culture, but aren't all human beings extremely similar, despite of 'different' cultures?\r\n\r\nI hope so much that through computers and the internet, society will get improved, that our live (and that of future generations) will have a greater quality. Yes, it's a bit utopian. But if you haven't an utopia in mind, you can't help work towards it. Of course I'm conscious that we can never reach real utopia - nothing can ever be 'perfect', but everything can always get improved.\r\n\r\nBut as much as I hope, as much do I fear. Fear, that we'll miss chances to create a better world. The whole thing is so fragile. Think about all the people that are part of our global society. Think about all the things that influence their thinking. Think about all the emotions that can explode suddenly, if some fool says something wrong. And think about all the people that have only their-selves in mind, or maybe their-selves and some guys that happen to have the same blood, or the same nationality. But we can't ignore the fact that we all live on the same planet and that we all are men. \r\n\r\nThere will be problems until everybody is happy.

Whether I supported continued engagement or a full-scale  pull-out, would be completely orthogonal to the point made here).\r\n\r\nIt doesn't matter whether the US stays in Iraq or against, the constant fighting of war will never solve any conflict. (Well, unless you, like Hitler, consider extermination a \"solution\").\r\n\r\nWhat <em>actually</em> stops wars is when people stop <em>wanting</em> to fight.\r\n\r\nWhen does that happen? It happens when they no longer perceive fighting as the only way to solve their immediate problems. \r\n\r\nSo long as we continue to allow the living conditions of people around the world to decline and ignore the basic needs of other human beings, we are creating constantly increasing tensions that will eventually lead to war of some kind. So if we stop thinking about \"peacetime concerns\" during war, we'll only prolong the wars and/or cause new ones to spring up.\r\n\r\nThat's why it's always a silly argument to say we should stop being concerned about free software (or the economy, or health care, or food production, or the environment, etc) just because there are wars and injustice in the world. Making the world a safer place for the people in it <em>is</em> fighting injustice.\r\n"

    body: "I intentionally avoided specifically endorsing a particular technology or project. That's because such calls are always controversial, and in the end it doesn't matter that much: ultimately \"the market\" (or \"natural selection\") will decide that.\r\n\r\nBut I think the most important aspect of programs like the OLPC is that it provides a meaningful tool for people in developing countries to act on their own. Too often, development programs are based on the flawed assumption that people in developed nations always know what's best for people in developing nations.\r\n\r\nThe OLPC has been criticized on just those grounds, but I think such criticisms miss the point that the OLPC is a very general-purpose tool. Though much of the promotional copy for OLPC goes on about it as a means for \"education\" (which can be regarded negatively as spoon-feeding developed world values to the developing world), they are, as general purpose computers, equally capable of communicating developing world ideas back to the developed world (what I clumsily described as \"speaking back\" above) and of course, for citizens of developing nations to speak to each other.\r\n\r\nConsider the place we'll be when the first OLPC-owning kid from a developing nation starts a free software project at Sourceforge (or another community site). We're still educated to think of the developing world as a burden to be born by the developed world (they used to call this idea the \"white man's burden\"—a less politically correct but more honest label). But minds are assets, not burdens. And tools that amplify the power of those minds enhance those assets.\r\n\r\nOf course, naysayers will argue that most kids won't be able to take advantage of these tools. But that's true in the developed world, too. But let's just imagine what happens if just 0.1% of the people receiving OLPC laptops explore their new capabilities and learn how to develop them. If OLPC actually hits their 100 million unit goal, that's 100,000 new developers!\r\n\r\nAnd remember, these are kids whose first computer experience will be a GNU/Linux system, based on free software. It's hard for me to imagine any outcome where this does not result in enormous new production and innovation. We're not used to imagining that kind of thing coming from the developing world, but things like OLPC will make it possible.\r\n\r\nI find that a really inspiring idea.\r\n"
