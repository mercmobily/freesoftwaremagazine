We provide excellent training opportunities at a very reasonable price and it is a great way to meet other local system administrators. Registration for Cascadia 2012 has opened and Early Bird Registration only lasts until March 7th. You can purchase as little as a half-day tutorial or come for the full weekend. We will have tutorials and talks from people in field giving you the most current trends in system administration. This event is for experienced and new system admins alike.
