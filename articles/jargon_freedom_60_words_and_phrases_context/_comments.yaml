    body: "Gratis has been present in English for some time (and if use of Libre continues that may find its way into the OED and other dictionaries too). The phrase \"free and gratis\" has in the past been used to describe something with zero cost and obligation -- at least in my region of the UK. Gratis is among those words adopted into English from other languages like restaurant, kiosk and pukka (okay maybe the last one is just British English). Libre has no real English usage or equivalent but has probably seen greater usage where the distinction is important.\r\n\r\nBoth gratis and libre have their origins in Latin as do so many words coming out of the regions they occupied. Wikipiedia has a good piece on [Gratis vs Libre](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gratis_versus_Libre)\r\n\r\n\\-\\-  \r\nEquitas IT Solutions - fairness, quality, freedom  \r\n[http://www.equitasit.co.uk](http://www.equitasit.co.uk)"
