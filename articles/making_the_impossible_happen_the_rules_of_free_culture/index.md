# How did they do that?

Six “impossible things”: GNU/Linux, Wikipedia, the Creative Commons, the Blender Foundation, Open Hardware, and the OLPC/Sugar project. All created under free licenses for everyone to use, in defiance of our conventional ideas of business economics. Is it magic, coincidence, or just plain common sense at work here?

The author explores the reality of these projects from an insider's perspective and picks out a set of five easy to follow rules for keeping your own projects in tune with the rules of free culture and on the track to success.

Includes the entirety of the “Impossible Things” and “Rules of the Game” article series written for Free Software Magazine, as well as five bonus articles on improving commons-based processes.

Paperback or Hardback: 290 pages with 94 illustrations.
