    body: 'Yes, there is always a "but"...  I found the review to be informative and detailed enough to interest me in considering buying this book.  However, I would have found it much more helpful, and credible, if the reviewer would have done some comparison with other Python textbooks.  For example, how does it compare as a reference to "Python in a Nutshell"; or, as a learning text for beginners, to "Learning Python", "Programming Python" or "Beginning Python"; or, as a source of useful examples (alluded to in the "Cons" section) to the "Python Cookbook".  I always find I learn more from book reviews that have a comparative sections with other books that I may already be familiar with.  Also, as alluded to above, it helps to establish the credibility of the reviewer in his/her evaluation of the book.'
