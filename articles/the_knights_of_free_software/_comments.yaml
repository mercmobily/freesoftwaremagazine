    body: "I am sorry, but I for one will have none of it, for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n(1) I don't believe that programmers are any better qualified to tell society what it \"ought\" to be like than anybody else.\r\nWhat Programmers *can* do is set an example of how to respond when *their* freedoms are encroached on, and present an alternative to closed-source software with it's associated bottled-water salesmen ethics. This is essentially what Open Source is all about. Giving people a choice instead of telling them what to do.\r\n\r\n(2) As to the idea of turning programmers into \"evangelists\",  I shudder at the thought of having people who aren't necessarily educated beyond coding tell the world how they feel it ought to behave. We have enough political parties for that. And ... speaking in European terms, Open Source programmers span the political spectrum from the Greens to Social-Democrats to Christian parties (and only seem to appeal to \"Conservative\" parties in a cost-benefit sense). Would you really want to try and have a big political as to which political faction Open Source should embrace, and which political stream should be allowed to claim Open Source as its exclusive domain? If you were to succeed, this would likely mean the marginalisation of Open Source in political terms.\r\n\r\n(3) Supporting the ideals of \"Open Source\" isn't a religion, it's sometimes an ethical choice, often a practical choice, and in many cases a cold-hearted calculating business choice. Open Source merely follows those practices that have made Science what it is today: visible and open to criticism by anyone who is willing (and able) to take the time and effort to understand it. In addition, Open Source makes often sense from a business and development perspective, _regardless_ of one's ethics. After all ... how much of the corporate contributions (IBM, SUN, Novell, as in Open Office, Java, the JFS, power-pc enhancements) were made by people who have taken a vow of poverty?\r\n\r\nI fear that associating Open Source with a \"vow of poverty\" will mean the kiss of death to its credibility in the world, starting with the corporate world, the mainstream press, public opinion, and working downwards from that. Would you truly want to give Microsoft the opportunity to tell people: \"You can deal with us or with those loony anti-capitalist vow-of-poverty zealots?\" and not have it be FUD? Just after Open Source has begun to gain wide-spread credibility in Government, Industry, Academia, *and* the public consciousness?\r\n\r\nWell ... I don't, and I hope that this idea of yours dies a quick and, above all, _silent_ death."

When you say the knights wouldn't own property, do you mean any property or property in excess? I think some property would be necessary, obviously a computer and clothes, also arguably a refrigerator and stove. Land could also prove useful for growing one's own food which would make it possible for the knight to live on even less actual money. I'm assuming the knights would be allowed to have families so only renting might not be practical for one's whole life. Perhaps they could own modest shelter of some sort such as a small house or a yurt. Those are just some things that came to mind.\r\n\r\nI hope your ideas are accepted and The Knights of Free Software becomes a reality. I would love to see this grow and develop in the future.\r\n\r\n--Faith Mansell"

    body: "I couldn't agree more. In fact, I'm surprised to see anyone who still thinks of computers as luxury items. I'd say that any item that you need as part of a job isn't a luxury, but a tool. If the tool also doubles as an entertainment device, what of it? The important thing is the utility it can serve.\r\n\r\nIt'd even make sense for someone to claim a game console as a tool if the device could be put to good use. I don't know if it's true or not, but I've seen lots of people claiming that in many cases it's more cost effective to hack a game box into a GNU/Linux machine than it is to buy a dedicated computer. If these modded boxes were used to provide cheaper computing power to poor people, why not?  \r\n\r\nFinally, I'm not sure I'm willing to say that games are purely unnecessary. I think we learn a lot about who we are as people by playing games. Who could imagine our society without chess, for instance? Many of the best games allow us a fun way to test ourselves and keep our mental skills sharp.  "

(Not that I specifically support SUV's.)\r\n\r\nIn truth computers ARE a luxury. How do I know this? Because there are millions of people that are still able to survive without them. Turn your computer off... you will still live.\r\n\r\nAlso, I see no conflict between Free Software and aquiring wealth. Some people aquire wealth in ethical ways, some don't. So please try not to clump everyone that is wealthy in the same catagory, Mr. Shuttleworth and I don't appreciate it.\r\n"

    body: "I'm really happy to see that people are engaging with this post, even if they don't necessarily support all of the ideas behind it. I'll try to take a few of the issues folks have raised here and see if I can resolve a few of them.\r\n\r\n<cite>I don't believe that programmers are any better qualified to tell society what it \"ought\" to be like than anybody else. As to the idea of turning programmers into \"evangelists\", I shudder at the thought of having people who aren't necessarily educated beyond coding tell the world how they feel it ought to behave.</cite>\r\n\r\nIdeally, these knights would never \"tell somebody what do to,\" except for their squires, who have requested that they do so! Please don't think I'm advocating some Jeremiad here. As I mentioned in the post, the knight would only ask the person questions, engaging him in a debate--and hopefully helping that person improve his thinking. \r\n\r\nI could tell someone, \"Hey, don't buy an SUV,\" but why should she listen? The only way I can really convince someone not to buy do so would be to offer compelling and persuasive reasons not to. A sample dialog might run something like this:\r\n\r\nQ: \"Why do you feel you need a SUV?\" \r\nA: \"Because they're really cool.\"\r\nQ: \"What is it about them that makes them seem so desirable to you?\"\r\nA: \"Hmmm...I guess because they're a status symbol.\"\r\nQ: \"So, would you say that it's really other people that want the SUV, and you want it to make them jealous of you?\"\r\nA: \"Well, I don't know...\"\r\n\r\nSo, in this vein, the knight can go on at some length, until the person either decides not to buy the SUV or will at least agree to put it off and think it over.\r\n\r\n<cite>Supporting the ideals of \"Open Source\" isn't a religion, it's sometimes an ethical choice, often a practical choice, and in many cases a cold-hearted calculating business choice.</cite>\r\nWho said anything about open source? I really have nothing to say about it. I'm concerned only with the free software movement, which is far more idealistic than open source by design.\r\n\r\n<cite>Software development on the other hand is not specifically spiritual...although I would be the first to admit that the FLOSS community embodies many positive 'spiritual' principles.</cite>\r\nYes, I agree with this statement. In fact, this is basically the reason I envisioned the \"knights\" in the first place. The FS advocates I've met are very morally upright people, even if they don't necessarily claim to be \"spiritual.\" What the knights could do is extend these tendencies and hopefully work on creating a more \"spiritual\" base for the movement, though I'd hope that anyone involved in this wouldn't look to a supernatural being for help. This is a movement about people helping people, not people begging a supernatural force to help them.\r\n\r\n<cite>When you say the knights wouldn't own property, do you mean any property or property in excess? I think some property would be necessary, obviously a computer and clothes, also arguably a refrigerator and stove.</cite>\r\nI've been thinking about this issue very carefully. What I'd like to suggest is that there's a difference in needing something to use it, and needing something to \"own\" it. For instance, a farmer doesn't necessarily need to claim private ownership of a plow to use it. He could freely choose to freely share the plow with whoever else needed it, provided they were of the same sharing mindset. \r\n\r\nAll I'm really doing is trying to apply the same \"share and share alike\" of the GPL to every kind of \"property.\" I think that the minute we start saying, \"Well, THIS is mine, and THAT is mine,\" we've lost something. A knight might say, \"I'm the one using this computer now,\" but would gladly share it with anyone else when he or she wasn't using it. \r\n"

No, for two reasons. First is because FSF people are looked upon as \"cultish\" enough without any extras. Second is because it spreads my time and resources to thin. I care more about _digital_ freedom in the future than I care about the others. If you care more about something besides _digital_ freedom, I suggest you concentrate on that instead.\r\n\r\nI ask you to please stop all of this. We just need people to continue writing code, writing documentation, and continue to help bring others to _digital_ freedom.
