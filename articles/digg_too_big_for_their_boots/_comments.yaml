    body: "I've noticed the quality of the stories on Digg's front page have gone down lately; so much so I've removed the main Digg feed from my subscriptions. I think your point about stories having to pander to the lowest common denominator probably hits the nail on the head.\r\n\r\nWould have liked to see a few more numbers in the story though: you mention that there are fewer free software stories making their way to the front page, but just how many fewer? If you take account of all the Ubuntu stories I might find that surprising!\r\n\r\nJon"

    body: "I couldn't be sure what it was... after so many diggs and so many wonderfuly wasted hours, something had died.  It happened last night.  I could feel some sort of a tipping-point being reached.  Maybe it was the 'spidercat', maybe it was the multiple takedowns of articles I had just read and was about to digg.  There had been dumb stories before, and there had been takedowns before.  But this was the first time I had ever looked at the digg frontpage and not seen a single article that interested me.  In fact, every single article looked like the crap that scrolls across the bottom of MSNLive.  Where had digg gone?\r\n\r\nSo I've spent the last day in a massive internet quest to find where to go next.  After finaly getting frustrated and giving up, I went back to digg and found this article on the frontpage.  Thanks so much for expressing my sentiments exactly.  And thanks even more for the links.  I don't think I'll be digging much anymore."

It just felt like recently, there hasn''t been that much for those of us interested in free software to read, and anything that does make it is being decimated by boisterous non fs people talking about how much fs sucks. My suppositions about numbers could be wrong though. But hey, I got buried after an hour or so on the front page, so that''s one and counting! :-) '
