    body: "[Hmm, I thought I already posted this -- I'll try again]\r\n\r\nA reader contacted me to point out that Thomas Jefferson did not write the US Constitution, so he did not in fact write the langauge enabling copyrights and patents \"for limited times\".  He was in France at the time, and James Madison is the one who is primarily credited with the language in the Constitution.\r\n\r\nJefferson was, however, quite opinionated about this subject and several others embodied in the Constitution, and he wrote several commentaries on it. It's probably also safe to say that he was quite influential on the ideas that went into the Constitution. He also campaigned successfully for the addition of the Bill of Rights.\r\n\r\nJefferson did write the Declaration of Independence.\r\n\r\nThanks for this and other input and corrections. I will see that the change is introduced in later versions of the work if and when they are published."
