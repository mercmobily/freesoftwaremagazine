[Seabird](http://mozillalabs.com/conceptseries/2010/09/23/seabird/) is a new
phone concept. Its main aim is to show you how a really cool video about a
really amazing device that doesn't exist yet can be used to talk about a very
amazing browser, Firefox Mobile for Android, that doesn't exist yet. What's
left to be seen, is whether *you* exist.

[Microsoft's Live spaces bloggers will become
Wordpress](http://www.geek.com/articles/news/microsoft-to-migrate-live-spaces-bloggers-to-wordpress-20100927/)
Apparently, the import procedure might consist in a few people working
overtime for one day at the most, to move the few dozens users over from Live
Spaces to Wordpress.

[OpenOffice Forked Into
LibreOffice](http://www.documentfoundation.org/contact/tdf_release.xml). The
short story: imagine OpenOffice as a bar of soap, wet, and Oracle as a spoilt
rich child in a bath who is used to keeping everything he liked, and break
everything he didn't like. The soap is slippery. And it doesn't break.

[Sony Ericsson abandons
Symbian](http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-09-24/sony-ericsson-is-planning-no-new-symbian-products.html).
Maybe, and I say, maybe, Symbian was turned into free software a little tiny
bit too late. And maybe, it was turned into free software for the wrong
reasons. And maybe, and I say really maybe, Android is better. Maybe.

[Microsoft sues Motorola over
Android](http://www.engadget.com/2010/10/01/microsoft-files-itc-complaint-against-motorola-over-alleged-andr)
I have the feeling that if Microsoft got somebody to train their lawyers so
that they became programmers, they would be able to compete against Motorola
with a better product, rather than a better lawsuit. In the meantine, go to
the link there and read the incredible comments by phonelol. It's astoturfing
at its finest. "lol"!

[Zenoss'
newsletter](http://community.zenoss.org/blogs/zenossblog/2010/09/30/zenoss-newsletter--september-2010)
is shamefully mentioned in Free Software Magazine's newsletter. The shameful
part is that Free Software Magazine is sponsored by Zenoss; the good news is
that Zenoss is free software, and it's good.

[Cari.Net](http://www.cari.net) hosts Free Software Magazine. Tony Mobily
himself has once said that their support, when things went wrong a couple of
months back, has been exceptional. Tony also admits that if the support hadn't
been exceptional, he would stay very quiet about Cari.net. But Tony Mobily,
while talking about himself in the third person, DID say that they were great.
So...
