    body: "I think you have a basic misunderstanding of Feminism if you think that what feminists really want is \"more colorful themes and cuter graphics.\"  Most feminists would probably argue that that is, in fact, a very sexist remark (whether or not that's actually what most female linux users desire; somehow, I doubt that's the real problem).\r\n\r\nNormally, I wouldn't say anything, but you are <a href=\"http://www.freesoftwaremagazine.com/blogs/why_does_kde_use_slaves\">concerned about terminology and prejudice</a>, so it seemed appropriate.\r\n\r\nWikipedia's got an ok article on <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feminism\">Feminism</a>, so take a glance, and bear in mind that feminism is fairly heterogeneous."
