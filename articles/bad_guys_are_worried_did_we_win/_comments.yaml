It's been pointed out that the quote I reference may not have been said by him and I'm happy to acknowledge that. It is often used by free software advocates though. ;)\r\n \r\n--\r\nEquitas IT Solutions - fairness, quality, freedom\r\nhttp://www.equitasit.co.uk"

    body: "A few comments elsewhere (I'm responding here to keep things in one place) have suggested/requested I define what I mean by \"win\". I thought I had with this paragraph:\r\n\r\n > Iâ€™m not sure we will win, because honestly I think the proprietary guys are fighting a different battle. They seem to be desperately clinging to the money-for-old-rope model of control and more control. Free software by contrast has no marketing team, no driving force extending from share prices.\r\n\r\nIn the title I use the word \"win\" as something others may think of. Personally I think you can't define what free software winning means simply because it's in a different game as the above paragraph suggests. It's something I've written on before:\r\n\r\n* [Why Microsoft should not lose and free software will still win](http://www.freesoftwaremagazine.com/columns/why_microsoft_should_not_lose_and_free_software_will_still_win)\r\n\r\n* [Let's stop playing the numbers game - free software has changed the game](http://www.freesoftwaremagazine.com/columnts/lets_stop_playing_numbers_game_free_software_has_changed_game)\r\n\r\nHTH  \r\nRyan  \r\n\\-\\-  \r\nEquitas IT Solutions - fairness, quality, freedom  \r\n[http://www.equitasit.co.uk](http://www.equitasit.co.uk)"
