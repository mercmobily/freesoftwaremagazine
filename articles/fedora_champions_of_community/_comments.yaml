There's plenty of unofficial Fedora sites out there, which the Fedora Project actively embraces and supports.  For example, Fedora Unity and Fedora News and Fedora Forum.  None of those are run by Red Hat people -- all by Fedora volunteers.  As the leader of the Fedora Project, I can tell you that I have never tried to shut down any Fedora websites (even the ones that say bad things about us), and I have always said that it would be unacceptable for anyone else to do so either.  The only time that Fedora has to ask people to change what they are doing is if they are violating our trademark.  If you don't understand why that is important, I recommend that you read a bit about US trademark law.\r\n\r\nHow does the Ambassador system try to bind anyone to a distribution?  All they do is show up at events, hand out DVDs, and talk about Fedora and Free Software.\r\n\r\nMajor issues are decided by the Fedora Board, which is comprised of 5 Red Hat Employees and 4 Community Members.  Additionally, more and more responsibility for Fedora Engineering has been pushed to a committee of leaders within Fedora that is also a well-balanced collection of community and Red Hat leaders.\r\n\r\nYou are spreading FUD.  Either give some examples of recent history, or admit that your complaints may have been valid a few years ago, but that recent history shows clear improvement."

The language is in fact very similar to what you see in various terms of usage.  It gives the Fedora Project (the entity on behalf of which Red Hat is requesting this grant of license) the rights to do stuff such as ... display your contribution on a webpage; store your contribution in CVS; move your contribution to a different SCM than CVS; put your contribution in a Fedora ISO; and so forth.\r\n\r\nEven when you contribute to Wikipedia, it reminds you that your work is now licensed under the GFDL:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Copyrights\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Copyrights</a>\r\n\r\nThe Fedora CLA makes it easier for the Fedora Project to make Fedora, distribute Fedora, and not get itself, Red Hat, or anyone else in legal trouble at the same time.  If you don't like those ideas, you continue to be welcome to not sign it.\r\n\r\nAs for the Wiki, we are at least and at last close to providing a click-through only interface to accepting the CLA, so Wiki-only contributors can join without using a GPG key.\r\n\r\nAs for the choice of license, it is obvious why Fedora chose it -- it is simply the best license for the job.  The reasoning is explained here:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/DocsProject/Licensing/FAQ\">http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/DocsProject/Licensing/FAQ</a>\r\n\r\nFedora makes choices in the direction of maximum freedom.  That includes choosing the best content license available.  Other people's lawyers can offer them other solutions and licenses to choose from.  Fedora's lawyers have their own opinion, and it's a well-respected one in all other matters.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.google.com/search?q=mark+webbink\">http://www.google.com/search?q=mark+webbink</a>\r\n"

Sure, GFDL, but I do not grant the Wikipedia Foundation my copyrights.I would not contribute then, too. You seem to mix up licenses and copyrights. I am very much for free licenses, but I do not trust Red Hat so far that I would like them to relicense my material, especially when people say that the CLA allows Fedora not to having to discuss relicensing in teh future again.\r\n\r\nI also like to question why Red Hat should get any copy rights if in fact Fedora is a community project. Why then does a company need copyrights of contributions? I could imagine those rights be nice for a community organisation.\r\n\r\nYou said \"As for the choice of license, it is obvious why Fedora chose it -- it is simply the best license for the job.\" - \r\n\r\nOk lets quote the FAQ:\r\n\r\n\"Why Not Use Another License, Such as a Creative Commons (CC) License, or the GNU Free Documentation License (FDL) ?\r\nThe legal counsel for the Fedora Project carefully examined all of the well-known content licenses, and concluded that only the OPL met all of the criteria for an unambiguous and enforceable license that would guarantee the freedoms of contributors and users.\"\r\n\r\nOk, the reasoning is: We dont care what the community says - and we also do not care if the publishers of the OPL have recommended to the Creative Commons licenses, (Wikipedia: \"The OPL is now largely defunct, and its creator suggests that new projects not use it.\", http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Publication_License) Fact is that this is a license prior to CC and the CC licenses were build after seeing what problem arose from this license (optional clause, etc.). I also like to cite the GNu organisations words about the OPL:\r\n[QUOTE]\r\n Open Publication License, Version 1.0\r\n\r\n    This license can be used as a free documentation license. It is a copyleft free documentation license provided the copyright holder does not exercise any of the “LICENSE OPTIONS” listed in Section VI of the license. But if either of the options is invoked, the license becomes non-free.\r\n\r\n    This creates a practical pitfall in using or recommending this license: if you recommend “Use the Open Publication License, Version 1.0 but don't enable the options”, it would be easy for the second half of that recommendation to get forgotten; someone might use the license with the options, making a manual non-free, and yet think he or she is following your advice.\r\n\r\n    Likewise, if you use this license without either of the options to make your manual free, someone else might decide to imitate you, then change his or her mind about the options thinking that that is just a detail; the result would be that his or her manual is non-free.\r\n\r\n    Thus, while manuals published under this license do qualify as free documentation if neither license option was used, it is better to use the GNU Free Documentation License and avoid the risk of leading someone else astray.\r\n\r\n    Please note that this license is not the same as the Open Content License. These two licenses are frequently confused, as the Open Content License is often referred to as the “OPL”. For clarity, it is better not to use the abbreviation “OPL” for either license. It is worth spelling their names in full to make sure \r\n[/QUOTE]\r\n\r\nAnother fact is that this licenses is incmpatible with CC AND woith GFDL which are both more popular. Every free software project should rather choose a license that is compatible than a license in fact nobody uses. Ah right, not nobody, Red Hat did. What a coincidence?\r\n\r\nSo you really think that your lawyers are so much smarter than the ones of GNU and Creative Commons and so many other distributions? I think Fedora does work similar as the OpenOffice.org project here. Wow and they also have a license of their own! The thing is: If every project would use  a license of its own one really could just remove the license and just have a CLA and a copyright, because nobody else would use the license. \r\n\r\nReal live example: I wanted to copy some stuff from OO documentation to Wikipedia (there are some nice descriptions about layout terms). Fact is: I could not, because OOs documentation is PDL while the one of Wikipedia is GFDL. This in fact means that neither Abiword, Scribus nor Koffice could use this, too.\r\nOr simply: If a user writes a great explanation in the Ubuntu wiki (which is licensed: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DocumentationTeam/License CC-BY-SA-2.5 which is pretty standard) - you could not copy this great explanation but your users or a Red Hat employee would have to write from scratch.\r\n\r\nSo alltogether I can neither agreee that those comitee decisions have been very smart, nor do I agree that Red Hat is not beeing granted copyrights over material of the users (well in fact not over my content,but only of those users who have signed the CLA). I hope you now have deleted my content because I was not allowed to remove mine - and in fact nobody asked me or any other wiki user what we think would be a smart solution.\r\n\r\nI still thinK Fedora is technically interesting and also has some great people on board, but it is not THE community distribution. I won't either say its OpenSuse, but there are many other distros who lsiten much more to the users. A distribution should be happy about people who spread the word. I wanted to do this but could not, because only Ambassadors should, and as I did not want to become want and did not want to get sued by Red Hat because I did I had to switch the distro. This is NOT a good example how to build up a nice community. The opposit. If you say: Every user is welcome to spread the world and hand out CDs/DVDs or give tlaks about Fedora then I would see first signs in Fedoras policy which I would welcome because the Fedora users deserve to be respected as they are Linux users like we all are.\r\n\r\n\r\nThilo\r\n \r\n-- \r\nThilo Pfennig\r\nBlog: http://flinux.wordpress.com/"

Fact is, that I left Fedora only because of the community, which I think is generally a bad thing and indicates that soemthing is wrong. I am not a distro hopper, although I have had some of them since 1997. Right now I use Foresight - the primary reason is, that although this is not a community distribution as Fedora defines itself, I and the community can decide and discuss much more core things (even the Logo).\r\n\r\nSo the question is maybe \"What is a community distribution?\" Or \"hat is a good community distribution?\" A distribution can also choose to work in different styles like a) Everything that is done must be decided democratically or b) Those who do things or are more affected decide when a decision has to be made (anarchistic) or c) Those who have gained support from a company or through essential contributions decide in comitees (meritocracy).\r\n\r\nFrom my view a distribution can not be meritocratic and community based at the same time. This is a community more like an infantry but not as part of the distribution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n-- \r\nThilo Pfennig\r\nBlog: http://flinux.wordpress.com/"

    body: "I said: \"So does Red Hat get a copyright of my work? Yes, it does.\"\r\n\r\nJef said: \"No. It gets a copyright license. If you don't understand the difference you are confused about copyright laws.\"\r\n\r\nNo, you dont understand: A OPL or GFDL is a license. You are granting some rights and some freedoms to anybody. You do not need a CLA to use a free license. The CLA additional to the OPL defines that Red Hat is granted a full copyright without any limits. What the CLA does not anc can not do: It can not take away the copyright from me. At least in Germany that would be illegal anyway. In Germany a copyright always belongs to you and thats why there is no public domain in Germany like in the US.\r\n\r\nAgain the quote: \"Contributor Grant of License. You hereby grant to Red Hat, Inc., on behalf of the Project, and to recipients of software distributed by the Project:\r\n    * (a) a perpetual, non-exclusive, worldwide, fully paid-up, royalty free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute your Contribution and such derivative works; ...\"\r\n\r\nThis means that Red Hat can do what ever they want with my content and the sense of this license is to\r\n\r\n a) Give Red Hat the possibility to protect my content from misuse outside the project and\r\n b) To allow Red Hat to print my contributions like for use in RHEL and I give them the full copy rights. I can not revoce the license or later come and demand money from Red Hat if a HOWTO I make and they sell earns them a lot of money. \r\n\r\nBut this CLA is indeed more than just a simple license like the OPL or any other license would be that gives ANYBODY similar rights. So they decided that the OPL just gives Red Hat not enough rights. So they do it different as the Wikimedia Foundation who just accepts anonymous and contributions by name without forcing users to sign any further agreements or giving the Foundation any additional rights. In fact Red Hat would have the right to take my content, put it in a book, sell it and protect it by their own rights and by that loosing the original OPL. The only theing they may not do is to tell ME that i may not publish my own content any more. It also gives Red hat the right to decide tomorrow that all documentation contenmt will be GFDL or CC licensed, no matter under what license the contributors published their content. So in fact the CLA is a way to circumvent the OPL as it gives Red Hat similar rights as I have - copy rights - call it \"copy right license\" or \"copy rights\" anyway the right to copy without having to follow the OPL - why else should they have added a CLA if the OPL would have been enough for them?\r\n\r\nI am not claiming that Red Hat is planning something evil, rather I think that lawyers like recommending their company to be always on the save side. But this includes in this case that they recommended that additionally to the free content license the contributor must give Red Hat more rights, so they can protect themselves better or easier.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI said: \"I think Fedora does work similar as the OpenOffice.org project here. Wow and they also have a license of their own! \"\r\n\r\nJef said: \"False. Openoffice.org uses LGPL. They dropped the sun specific license long back. Again a claim corrected in the mailing lists already. Millions of users are happy using Fedora. Your repeated incorrect claims is not going to stop that. If you are happing using another distribution feel free. Noone is stopping you.\"\r\n\r\nOpenOffice.org quote: \"The document license is the Public Document License (PDL).\" (source:http://www.openoffice.org/license.html)\r\n\r\nYou seem to have no idea at all about licenses\r\n\r\nI have now contacted the authors of the licenses and urged them to clarify the position about the OPL on the blog at http://www.opencontent.org/blog/ . I hope they do. I have read their statements on the old pages which they seemed to have taken offline now. As far as Iknow the problem with the OPL always was the optional clause and in fact the OCO also had criticized the CC for doing some similar \"mistakes\" with too many options (commercial/non-commercial,etc.) - althought these options are much more standardized as they are in the OPL.\r\n\r\n\r\nThilo\r\n-- \r\nThilo Pfennig\r\nBlog: http://flinux.wordpress.com/"

    body: "\"But this CLA is indeed more than just a simple license like the OPL\"\r\n\r\nRegardless of this it is a copyright license and it does not give your copyright to someone else. You still hold your copyrights and Red Hat gets a license. Same for FSF with any GNU software, Apache, Sun with Openoffice.org or opensolaris etc. Red Hat is doing nothing very different here\r\n\r\n\"I can not revoce the license or later come and demand money from Red Hat if a HOWTO I make and they sell earns them a lot of money.\"\r\n\r\nThat's the case with any Free software license. \r\n\r\n\r\n\"I have - copy rights - call it \"copy right license\" or \"copy rights\" anyway the right to copy without having to follow the OPL\"\r\n\r\nAgain copyright and copyright license is not one and the same. Learn some basic legal theory. \r\n\r\n\"why else should they have added a CLA if the OPL would have been enough for them?\"\r\n\r\nIt has already been explained to you several times and is in the fp.org wiki. OPL does not cover the entire range of software in the distribution but only some formal documentation. If a contributor had patent rights none of the copyright licenses would cover that. The CLA would. \r\n\r\n\"OpenOffice.org quote: \"The document license is the Public Document License (PDL).\" (source:http://www.openoffice.org/license.html)\r\n\r\nYou seem to have no idea at all about licenses\"\r\n\r\nNo. YOU don't. I already said OPL is used by many many vendors including Oreilly. So stop propogating this lie. \r\n\r\n\"I have now contacted the authors of the licenses and urged them to clarify the position about the OPL on the blog at http://www.opencontent.org/blog/ . I hope they do\"\r\n\r\nUntil they do you can stop claiming this since it cannot be verified. "

I just could not find a link to a good comprehensive text that discussed that or made the status of the OPL more clear. I hope you will now see that my criticism relating the OPL was also not just FUD as some claimed here but indeed based on facts. It maybe be that some lawyers still like the OPL more, but it just does not reflect the status of the open content debate any morem where as one CC license (CC-BY 2.5 or newer) even allow one-way compatibility to GFDL.\r\n\r\nOne should not see licenses as \"does the job best for distribution X\", but rather choose licenses who are modern and widely accepted and also more compatible so that content exchange gets easier.\r\n\r\n-- \r\nThilo Pfennig\r\nBlog: http://flinux.wordpress.com/"

Instead of people all banding together to make things better in the open source community, there always has to be people tearing it down. People have different outlooks and opinions on communities, because they have different expectations. Maybe rather than all of these comments complaining about what Fedora may have done in the past, why not just look hopefully towards the future, and not allow that kind of thing to happen at your favorite distribution. Don''t lose sight of the fact that every distribution is only part of the larger open source community, and isn''t that what it''s really all about?'

For those of you who seem to casually disregard this user by opening first defense or some of you who are saying the likes of \"Look towards the future, don't worry everything will be fine, blah blah blah\" I think you should back track and re-read. This user is making good points about the context of creeping privilege for licensing in the FOSS community. It's a shame that ordinary user's are having to take on the responsibilities of law perspective. Unfortunately these are the days where ownership and licensing is increasingly becoming a cut-throat business, even under our own scared umbrella of protection. \r\n\r\nWe are the community. If we don't watch what they're doing then who will? Don't support companies who slowly disregard the principles that our communities were founded on. It's as simple as that. "
