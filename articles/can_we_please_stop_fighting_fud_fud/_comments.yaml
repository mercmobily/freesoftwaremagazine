    body: "I agree with a lot of your sentiment. \r\n\r\nThe irony I find is that most of the most strident arguments against Microsoft are made by people who are still using MS products, and therefore feel personally enslaved by them. Or, they have only recently switched and are so enthusiastic they want to force everyone else to -- like recently converted non-smokers.\r\n\r\nThose of us who _never_ smoked are generally less concerned about the fact that some people do. I mean, hey, it's their life and their lungs. As long as they keep their smoke to themselves, I'm happy.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I try to lead by example. I found strong personal reasons for preferring free software over proprietary, and not all of them are the \"PC\" reasons. For example, I find not having to pay licensing fees a _BIG_ plus for free software -- it may not be \"about\" the zero-cost, but the zero-cost is nevertheless a real benefit. \r\n\r\nAnd yes, of course I'm aware that I'm paying out more labor to save that money -- it's the same decision I make when I repair my own house or car. But I routinely do make that decision, because it makes economic sense for me to do so. I'm a major do-it-yourselfer in a lot of areas of my life, so why not on the computer?\r\n\r\nI'm also aware that much of my practical attraction to GNU/Linux has more to do with it being a Unix-like system with proper multi-user design, security, built-in networking and other features that are basically bolt-on afterthoughts with Windows. I used to use Unix systems in college back in the 1980s, so this stuff was somewhat familiar to me when I switched. My reaction was \"Wow, this is like the big expensive computers the university owned, but _running on my PC_. Kewl!\" I got a particular kick out of the colliding galaxies screensaver, since I can still remember when running that simulation was considered serious astronomical research (because it was that hard to do back then -- now it's a toy).\r\n\r\nAnd on the flipside, much of my present disgust with Windows has to do with my lack of experience with it. I \"upgraded\" from Windows 3.1 to Debian \"Slink\". So I just don't use Windows anymore, and I don't know how to do anything with it. Nor do I want to know. I just don't need it.\r\n\r\nI enjoy the freedom that free software gives me, but I also believe that other people should be free to use proprietary software if they think it's a worthwhile deal (and let's not kid ourselves, there are times when that's a very practical decision).\r\n\r\nBasically, I don't care if much of the world wants to use Windows, as long as they leave me alone. But if they want me to service their PCs, or want to dump stuff on me that requires proprietary drivers or codecs to use, I find that a genuine personal irritation.\r\n\r\nThat's why I think the real battles should be over open standards. So long as the standards are open, free software can compete on its own merits against proprietary software, and I have enough faith in the process to believe it can win without having to resort to underhanded tactics.\r\n"

    body: "There may be some truth in what you are saying about tactics here. I don't however totally agree. It really is a matter of what side of the fence you stand on. I dislike the label FOSS in general because it assumes that there are equal values between the Free Software community and the Open source community. This is simply not true. This also covers what Terry Hancock said about recent converts. \r\n\r\nOpen source attitude: The open source community is about making the most technically superior software as possible. Most of the licenses are permissive and allow proprietary software to adapt their code and make it closed source. They would have no problem living side by side with proprietary software like Microsoft products. They wouldn't say such things are bad or a problem. \r\n\r\nFree Software: The Free Software community is about freedom of software as an ethical ideal. There fore proprietary closed source is seen as unethical and totally undesirable. This community is much more apt to get out there spread the word and tell people that Microsoft is evil or \"sucks\". They don't need to cite which programs the answer is any proprietary software falls into the \"sucks\" category. \r\n\r\nWhy Microsoft? Why not someone else? Answer simply is Microsoft is the most hostile to our communities. Openly saying that they are trying to find some way to get rid of us. \r\n\r\nabout competition: There is this idea that the free software community competes with Microsoft. This is not true for the same reason that freedom doesn't compete with slavery one is unethical one is not. the only struggle is to preserve freedom so that people can escape to it. \r\n\r\nThe open source community Also does not compete because closed source can use open sources code. Open source is kind of like a manufacturer that will sell to anyone.\r\n\r\nConclusion: I don't think that its FUD necessarily. Microsoft definitely engages in FUD as they are trying to destroy us in anyway possible. Spreading the word of freedom is never a scare tactic. Some badly researched people who have no idea what they are talking about may be engaging in FUD. But i don't thing its as widespread as we may believe     "

The most we can do is spread uncertainty, and perhaps try to encourage doubt.\r\n\r\nI'm not so sure. Firstly the fear in FUD is not fear about me but about the product I am spreading FUD about. Proprietary software companies do not want us to fear _them_, they want us to fear free software, they want us to fear that the GPL will force us to give away all our \"intellectual property\", they want us to fear that none of our software will work with GNU/Linux.\r\n\r\nSo in that context the FOSS community can and does find it quite easy to spread FUD. Consider how often we read that people should not use IE because it is \"full of security holes and bugs\". What is the purpose of that statement if not to induce fear in the end-user that their current browser leaves them open to attack. It may well be _true_ but the purpose of using it is to induce fear, uncertainty and doubt. It's FUD and it is especially so when it is done in a way that implies the problem is much much worse than it is. IE may be a security risk but some seem to imply that just having it on your system will mean you are cracked in seconds. Too often those spreading such information have not gained that knowledge for themselves but read it somewhere else.\r\n\r\n> The desire to pour bile out onto Microsoft is easy to understand.\r\n\r\nExactly--and I am not innocent on this.\r\n\r\n> But I came to the same conclusion you present here.

We would be better to simply state our case in the clearest and most positive way possible.\r\n\r\nPersonally I think one of the best weapons we have had in recent years is the Live CD. Giving a wavering user a copy of GNU/Linux which will not harm their PC in anyway but enables them to see if the FUD is true is a great boon.\r\n\r\ncheers\r\nRyan"

    body: "\"Recently switched users\" are very enthusiastic and they are the most likely people to change the freedom software community to welcome more new users. Well established \"Linux users\" know their way around software problems and are less likely to hit any usability problem. And usually when they find something that does not work for them they also have the knowledge and the power (as in community respect) to change things the way they want it to work. So new users know what can be should be improved in free software. Longer the time they spent using Linux, they have less \r\nand less information about where novices come from. \r\n\r\nAt the same time experienced users know how to promote Linux and what should be promoted to new users en masse. But experienced users have big jobs do not have the time to commit to marketing. They need to convey this information quickly to new users and these in turn will take the Linux message to novices. We should know that experienced users have a problem in making themselves understood by novices.\r\n\r\nSo all this is about the knowledge divide, a communication gap between gurus and novices. Either side has information the other needs, can't we establish a channel to break through the RTFM attitude of developers and the \"I want bug #4348 fixed!\" attitude of novices?\r\n\r\nQuote:\r\n&lt; What bothers me is when the “facts” are twisted or poorly researched. &gt;\r\nThis shows poor communication between people who know the facts (the chill, Linux gurus) and novices.\r\n\r\nThe solution is a focused Linux marketing community, where novices learn ideas and code of conduct from \"gurus\". In our community the most important \"learning vector\" is an example. So by example we shall teach others. IMHO correcting FUD coming from FOSS promoters is easier in such a community, than directly on Slashdot.org. Think only about the noise level when Microsoft promoters come on Slashdot.org/non-Linux specific online forums rightously pointing flaws in our own marketing message, and then they start sending FUD themselves. To build a strong message to the public we should first a review it inside our community.\r\nLook at how we develop software: leaving aside developers with commit-access to the versioning system, novices who correct bugs first submit them to the developers' mailing list where these patches are publicly reviewed and scrutinized. Same we should do with marketing: We should gather our mess together inside the community, correct obvious flaws and then sent the message to propagate further.\r\n\r\nDon't get me wrong and belive I mean only \"approved\" experienced users should promote Linux, on the contrary, novices can work along side gurus so they can take up behaviour from seeing gurus at work. Of course anyone can write about anything, but promoting inside the community will be easier for them, and they will come themselves to ask for advice.\r\n\r\nSuch a community has already been started, find it at http://TheTuxProject.org , but given the size of GNU/Linux, this particular community is largely undersized and underpromoted when compared to marketing efforts of other free software projects:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Firefox ( http://www.spreadfirefox.com/ )</li>\r\n<li>KDE (KDE marketing group http://dot.kde.org/1131467649/ )</li>\r\n<li>Miro ( http://getmiro.org/ )</li>\r\n<ul>\r\n\r\nOn a larger topic, maybe we like doing things informal and natural, but for a community to grow as large as we want Linux to be, we need a more standardized process of communication, even if  it will be an ad-hoc and \"de facto\" standard.\r\n"

Note that to be \"GPL compatible\" (highly desireable), licenses have to 1) be the GPL, 2) expressly allow conversion to GPL, or 3) not impose a copyleft. Thus most of the \"best practice\" licenses on the FSF licenses page are also non-copyleft -- is this tacit preference for non-copyleft licenses on the part of the FSF? \r\n\r\nIf not, then I can't really see grounds for making the same claim about the OSI. (Don't confuse \"most licenses\" with \"most licensed works\", the GPL is the hands-down favorite license for both groups and accounts for _most_ licensed works bearing either \"free software\" or \"open source\" labels).\r\n"

I'm pretty good in Python, but Perl scares me, and C is just way too much trouble to plow through.\r\n\r\nAnd I too have run into the cart-before-the-horse problem of complaining about the lack of documentation only to receive a \"well why don't you write some\" reply -- which is ludicrous, because only someone with a deep understanding of the software can write documentation for it. Too many programmers seem to regard documentation as some sort of afterthought that can be tacked on by unaffiliated users, rather than a fundamental part of the programming process. Even if I do want to write end-user documentation, I need _something_ to work from! And typically, that must be written by developers.\r\n\r\nIt is unfortunately true, though, that a lot of free software development doesn't have any budget to speak of. So, unless you are willing to move to a paid-support model (which most end users don't seem to be willing to do, in my experience), that's awfully hard to provide.\r\n\r\nSo, the attitude of programmers is somewhat unavoidable -- you are criticizing them for something they are providing to you for free, or \"looking a gift horse in the mouth\". I can certainly appreciate the cost of this to the community, but it's largely a cost of poor capitalization of free software projects, rather than some sort of stinginess or lack of human understanding.\r\n\r\nThe developer community is still an overwhelmingly amateur-dominated environment, so you have all the problems of any volunteer organization. People are willing to do the \"fun\" part, but not the \"work\" part -- but as long as they are doing that on a volunteer basis, it's kind of hard to fault them for it.\r\n\r\n"

    body: "<em>Those were very interesting articles</em>\r\n\r\nThanks! Please let me know, if you ever get the chance, the reactions to the Digifreedom home page of some absolute computer newbie!\r\n\r\nWith respect to your comments: before I answer directly to some points, I'll note that the initial theme (of Ryan's article, at least) is not so much \"how FOSS advocates <em>react</em> to newbie questions\" as much as \"how and why FOSS advocates shoot themselves in the foot when trying to get people use FOSS or at leat support it politically\".\r\n\r\nSince you liked the first links  I'll dare add, as contributions and food thought on this point, this <a href=\"http://digifreedom.net/node/94\">report of a phone conference I had with a LUG</a> (I'm always available to repeat the experience) and my suggestions on <a href=\"http://digifreedom.net/node/103\">\"how to turn into Free Software SUPPORTERS (not necessarily users) people who couldn't care less\"</a>. Feedback is always welcome, of course!\r\n\r\nOn to your comments, now:\r\n\r\n<em>Where the is a possibility of paying people (testers) to help move bugs from descriptions by non developer users to a form that is directly usable by developers, that would probably be a good idea (especially for software which is principally used by users without development skills)</em>.\r\n\r\n\r\nOpenOffice would be the perfect fit for this. The fact that SUN doesn't do it is a shame, really.\r\n\r\n<em>even if users do have developer skills, they may not have the right skills to work on a particular package</em>.\r\n\r\nIt's not even a matter of <em>skills</em>, it's a mater of <em>time and priorities</em>. If all computer users of today had to contribute in some way to all the software they (need to) use, nothing would ever get done.\r\n\r\nI always have in mind this picture of Linus, Mother Teresa or simply some unknown guy who spends all his free time volunteering in the streets to save kids from drug or abuses, or the environment, whatever... saying on a mailing list \"I noticed this program doesn't work or is not documented decently, please fix it\" and being told (or  looked at and consequently ignored, it doesn't matter) \"this is a community, you parasite: please fix it yourself!\"\r\n\r\nIf FOSS is to be used widely, its advocates must simply bury for good this \"idea\" that it's a community where almost everybody must, can or likes to contribute. It can only be the opposite, there is no escape from that.\r\n\r\n<em>unless you are willing to move to a paid-support model (which most end users don’t seem to be willing to do, in my experience), that’s awfully hard to provide.</em>\r\n\r\nTrue. But I'm not objecting to that, or saying that end users shouldn't realize it. I only object to hackers and geeks saying or believing that certain answers and concepts still make sense today, assuming they ever did sometime in the past. Ditto for this:\r\n\r\n<em>attitude of programmers is somewhat unavoidable — you are criticizing them for something they are providing to you for free</em>\r\n\r\nI don't criticize programmers doing something for free and I don't even necessarily ask them to do anything <em>more or differently</em>: freedom is freedom.\r\n\r\nI just ask them to stop answering in certain ways to justify their impossibility or unwillingness to do more. I suggest them to stop believe that their work is still something that, in today's world creates (or can, or <em>should</em> ever create) any kind of community among <em>all</em> its users.\r\n\r\nSure, no doubt that software free as in freedom is wonderful, it's absolutely necessary for a better world and all that. I DO believe it.\r\n\r\nLet's just remember that, for almost all (present or potential) FOSS users of today, any software will always be just a necessary evil or at best a really, really, really tiny part of their vision of the world, and that they very likely have much more urgent things to do the world a better place with their skills than programming, filing bug reports or writing software manuals.\r\n\r\nThat's why I tend to think that most of the time the problem is actually lack of human understanding, rather than poor capitalization or anything at that level. The longer you keep believing and preaching the \"user = developer\" mantra at the base of the GNU Manifesto, the four software freedoms and so on, the more you're hurting FOSS, because you scare potential political supporters, if not users, away. Which is exactly the point from Ryan which I approved in my first comment.\r\n\r\nMarco\r\n\r\n(PS: within the week, I will post on Digifreedom some more material on this issue and add the link to this comment. Stay tuned).\r\n\r\n-- \r\nYour own civil rights and the quality of your life heavily\r\ndepend on how software is used *around* you:\r\nhttp://digifreedom.net"

I would have agreed with you if those we're fighting would abide by the same rules, but as might be very well known, they don't. It's like fighting with one hand on your back. Do you think the Allies would have won WWII or the cold war if they would have had the very same ethics? Instead they bombed Dresden and many other German cities which took the lives of millions of German civilians, a war crime by any measure. Note they left the concentration camps and their transport lines unharmed. \r\n\r\nThe other side bribes editors, journalists and other media, uses munchkins to conterminate sites with harmful comments, sometimes posing as \"religious zealots\", rigs benchmarks and tests, need I say more? I think by comparison FOSS FUD is still pretty harmless.\r\n\r\nYour article is flawed as well. It has been proven that FOSS software contains less bugs than closed source - although I must admit that bugfree software can \"suck\" (as you so scientifically define it) in other ways as well. And don't be so naive: most FOSS people have worked with MS software extensively, for their work or otherwise. They know why it \"sucks\".\r\n\r\nHans Bezemer"

There's always an interesting journey to observe when developers of proprietary products start to wake up to the advantages of free software but it must always be their choice. Anything else is in danger of breeding contempt of the sort seen towards proprietary monopolists by many on the free software \"community\". :o)\r\n\r\nNice to see there are others prepared to speak up in the face of what seems an increasing tide though.  \r\nGood work--keep it up.\r\n\r\nCheers  \r\nRyan\r\n\r\n"

While you writings maybe true, they are hard to follow and require some hard mind focus on your post. This is something hard to read for a free software supporter who reads it late at night, like myself. This is also why I haven't read it thoroughly. \r\nQuote: <cite>\"I challenge everyone to read my recent blogs and find any misrepresented facts.\"</cite> \r\n\r\nGiven the fact that I haven't read your present post, I find it hard to believe I should invest more time in reading the rest of your blog posts. Please note that I am not trying to paint you as a bad guy, as we're all friends here, I am merely stating a problem. Perhaps this is also true about my own blog posts: http://bogdanlinux.blogspot.com/ \r\n\r\n@day9981: Yes, maybe FUD has a lot of meanings, but in this specific article it refers to lies and incomplete truth. Incomplete truth is bad because makes our messages weak to attacks from Microsoft 'employees' and FOSS-haters.\r\n\r\n@mrcopilot:\r\nYou are good at finding holes, but the general idea is that \"Moving to Linux is not always free-as-in-free-beer\" (see my post at http://www.thetuxproject.com/node/283#comment-834 ). Quote from the post:\r\n<cite>\"Transitioning from Microsoft Access to SQL Server - two Microsoft database products - may cost lots of money and I do not mean license fees. One needs to hire data transfer specialists to transform the tables from one format to another. Think only of transforming database procedures! These are small programs which run database side and stay between your database client and database tables. They do not run seamless even between two versions of a same product. Transforming them from a format to another is a pain! Never mind transferring to MySQL or another free-as-in-freedom database product!\"</cite> \r\nIn the rest of the post I speak of the cost to transform MSOffice macros to work with OpenOffice.org\r\nand retraining Microsoft Office Specialists as efficient OpenOffice.org users.\r\nI end my comment explaining why organizations seem to prefer short term savings (postponing the move to Linux) over long term loss (MS Windows & Office licensing costs).\r\n\r\n@ALL:\r\nPeople are always tempted to bring more proofs in their favor when in an argument, even when that proofs are only partially true. Using a proof that is true in 65-75% of the cases (and not saying explicitly so) leaves room for debate over the <em>validity + relevance</em> of your proof. That is what our detractors want: moving the topic of the discussion on \"a dead track\".\r\nMaybe you find reasons to overturn all of my examples given above, that does not change the fact that using a weak, questionable proof weakens your algorithm / rationale (yes this also applies to my post, too!). I would not recommend using even proofs that you are certain are true, but it is hard to show their validity online in an <strong>unquestionable</strong> way. So if you have any sign of doubt that your proofs need checking with an expert, please do so, please ask in a dedicated forum about it. By doing this you make your case hard to overturn/crack due to some silly wording. \r\nSpare nothing at preparing your set of proofs. If you are out of proofs in an argument, take a break (I promise Microsoft backers won't go anywhere), and ask a Linux guru about your issue. Also submit the argument to someone else (forum members, friends, friendly non free software supporters) stating the arguments of the adversary and your own, and ask if your conclusion clearly stands out from your case and set of proofs. Correct grammar and writing mistakes (be clueful http://wiki.cluenet.org/index.php/Clueful_Chatting ). Make your post hard to attack. Be good at it, better than myself! Make free software supporters proud of your post! It is not about making this or that  the year of the Linux desktop, it's about the year when marketing it got better.\r\n\r\nMotto: \"The best way to predict the future is to invent it\", http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Kay , inventor of the Smalltalk"

I don't see people dying and I don't hear of people being displaced or separated from families etc.\r\n\r\nOkay so \"war\" is being used as a metaphor here (I hope) but I still disagree this is about an ongoing \"war\" with anyone. The fact that free software has enemies does not mean we have to fight them in the same way. Microsoft et al fight when they feel threatened but in this case they are not threatened by a company or a retail price--they can handle those. They are threatened by an ideal--freedom. This rips into the heart of their controlling business model and they are worried so they fight, in the only way they know. After all \"business is war\".\r\n\r\nAnd here is the issue: free software is not a business, yes some of its proponents are in business but as a whole there is no traditional business ethic behind free software. Microsoft et al are very very good at their game--they have built their empires around it. Taking them on at that game is like David taking on Goliath at hand to hand combat. We need to play _our_ game--the one they can't compete with. Refute their statements, yes but actively attacking them seems like a waste of resources.  If you ask me we are spending far too much energy trying to fight Microsoft when what we should be doing is trying to help users discover the truth. \r\n\r\nA quote popularly used by the free software community against (usually Microsoft) FUD is from [Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahatma_Gandhi):\r\n\r\n=CODE_START=\r\nFirst they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win\r\n=CODE_END=\r\n\r\nIronically he used it in defence of non-violent activism. He chose not to fight the British on their own term--and he won.\r\n\r\n> Your article is flawed as well. It has been proven that FOSS software contains less bugs than closed source\r\n\r\nAre you _really_ saying that if I took any established proprietary application and picked a sourceforge project in beta that there would less bugs, crashes and issues in the former? No, you're not are you and **that** is my point. Generic statements like that do not help. You provide no source for your \"proof\", you give no links to case studies of people using free software successfully, you give no support. So why should someone new to free software believe you? What happens when--on the basis of your argument--they try free software and find bugs which make it less-than-usable for them? Your statement will then look like a twisted half-truth at best and you will have lost the interest of someone who could have contributed a great deal had they been better prepared.\r\n\r\nAs for being naive, I am talking about how these arguments appear to non-free software users who are showing an interest. They do indeed know how bad proprietary software can be and   their experience may have left them a little cynical. We need a different argument--or at least present out one in a better way--if we are going to convince them.\r\n\r\nOh and \"suck\" was not my definition, I was quoting it not using it. ;o) \r\n\r\ncheers  \r\nRyan"

It was _not_ originally called \"GNU/Linux\". Stallman complained about the name after the name \"Linux\" had already become established. People have been slow and/or reluctant to revise the terminology (and there are some serious holes in Stallman's arguments for the \"GNU/Linux\" label, anyway). So it is actually the FSF that is attempting a \"re-branding\" here.\r\n\r\nThe FSF is _not_ diminished, but from all reports is _growing_. It is probably _much_ larger today than it would've been, thanks to the enormous growth in mainstream users that was enabled by the OSI's efforts. Many more people today know and use free software because of the success of \"open source\".\r\n\r\nThe FSF, with its narrowly focused mission and platform, never would've attracted the broad mainstream audience that the OSI targeted.\r\n\r\nThe corporate interests that you are so afraid of have proved to be valuable allies in such areas as patent reform and patent pools -- efforts essential to the future success of free software.

Everyone is welcome. I especially like the site because it forms a community dedicated towards promoting free software. Expert promoters meet novices and learn from each other.\r\nThe Tux Project should not be considered a competition to other Free software sites, but especially a place where one learns how to <em>behave</em> and <em>promote</em> Linux on sites with more visibility (like Free Software Magazine, FS Daily)."

For me the attraction of free software is the philosophy and it means that proprietary software is not even in the same scope. Moving to free software can be an enabling, empowering and sometimes over-whelming experience but the end result--for me anyway--is that you never want to give that freedom back once you have reclaimed it. If anybody ever feels that giving back that freedom is worth it, then I fear we have failed in that instance.\r\n\r\n>> Thank you—I think.\r\n\r\n> You're Welcome.

Is it all fault of Microsoft advertising (that would be very convenient, wouldn't it?) or is it also due to the fact that too few, if any, in the FOSS community so far bothered to seriously interact with non programmers?\r\n\r\n<em>That is why Richard Stallman's book is called \"Free Software, Free Society\".</em>\r\n\r\nThanks for the link to Stallman's book, I'd have <a href=\"http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/6539\">never imagined he could write something so interesting</a>. I'll just repeat what I wrote to Stallman himself and several other people who still believe that the GNU Manifesto is enough: sure, five years ago I wrote that <em>\"the\r\nbook is necessary reading and not only for programmers... it is crucial that everyone thinks about these problems today\"</em>: but it is even more true that if I left that book, back-cover up, on the nightstand of 95% of the people I know personally, I'd find it in the same position, covered with dust, one month later.

Well, even if late, <a href=\"http://digifreedom.net/node/108\">here it is</a>.\r\n\r\nWith respect to this:\r\n\r\n<em>&gt;&gt;I disagree with the idea that people with disabilities need to learn to express themselves better.\r\n\r\n&gt;where did I say this?\r\n\r\nIt's implied by the title of your article - \"FOSS community, disabled users must learn to communicate\".\r\n</em>\r\n\r\nYou took <em>half</em> the title of a <em>whole</em>, 1000+ words article which explains that the <em>only</em> communication discussed is the direct one <em>between</em> those two specific groups of people, you transformed it into a \"people with disabilities need to learn to express themselves better\" blanket statement ignoring all the context... and <em>I</em> should bother about something you made up in your head?\r\n\r\nIf this is all the deep thinking that makes you disagree when I say \"maybe that's how things really stand, not just some misunderstanding of mine\" and dislike \"the excessively critical tone of many \"open source\" supporters\", I really suggest that we just stop for the moment: there is absolutely no point to start a personal flame war between the two of us, not here anyway. \r\n\r\nIf, and only if, you feel like it, please go in the streets, schools, malls, theaters, try to see which method is more effective to gain more support for FLOSS today and then come back to let us know how it goes.\r\n\r\nCiao,\r\nMarco\r\n\r\n-- \r\nYour own civil rights and the quality of your life heavily\r\ndepend on how software is used *around* you:\r\nhttp://digifreedom.net"

    body: "I disagree with most people on most issues. I don't think you and I have to worry about a flame war because we disagree. I feel no resentment towards you at all, but I definitely disagree.\r\n\r\nRichard Stallman is serious about freedom. His attitude is right on point as far as I'm concerned. When says \"freedom\", he's talking about real freedom, not something imaginary. He says it with conviction, because he'll settle for nothing less than real, tangible freedom.\r\n\r\nI don't think you're fully attentive to the people who obsessively try to take away our freedom. These people are control-freaks. They want to spy on all our communication, control how we use our computers, get most of our money and make us into gears in their fascist social machine.\r\n\r\nRichard Stallman has been fighting like the devil against these people in the most effective way he can for decades.\r\n\r\nRespect is due. \r\n"
