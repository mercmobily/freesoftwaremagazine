    body: "That conclusion sucks.  You need to elaborate more on the differences that exist, especially the apparent inability to run non-Solaris operating systems as guests.  Running Linux binaries in the fake lx zone seems like a horrible limitation subject to very incomplete emulation.\r\n\r\nYour coverage of Xen is inadequate, and you should explain any limitations that might exist when running Solaris as a Xen guest, instead of as a Solaris Zone guest.  Explain why someone would want to use Solaris as the Xen domain0, if any."
