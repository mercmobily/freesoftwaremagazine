    body: "I am not really sure that so many people develop \"for fun and relaxation\".\r\n\r\nSome people donate open source software as their contribution to the community\r\n\r\nSome people need a challenge and find a way to prove their talent in front of a large community\r\n\r\nSome people just develop a project or a product and do not see any reason to keep it for themselves (and do not want to sell it)\r\n\r\nSome people (or groups) need the help of the community to maintain a very large software system (like a RDBMS or an ERP)\r\n\r\nOf course, these motivations may combine and I am sure that there are still other ones. \r\n\r\nMarie-NoÃ«lle Baechler\r\nBelmont-sur-lausanne / Suisse\r\n"
