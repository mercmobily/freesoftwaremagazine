So i don't thing GPL is as free as GPL Lesser.\r\n\r\n\r\nBTW:\r\nWHooo Hoooo!!!\r\nI have won the book!!!, and i just used a Bugmenot Account... OUCH!!!"

    body: "So would you like to lose a tiny amount of freedom now, or all of it later?\r\n\r\nThe idea behind copyleft clauses is to keep future versions of the software free. If you allow conversion to proprietary licensing, then you encourage the work to be hijacked out of the free domain and into some commercial product. Like as not, you'll wind up paying for your own work.\r\n\r\nStill, I bridle at the use of words like \"ethically valid\" to promote this kind of thinking. It's one thing to talk about the value of freedom, it's quite another to call people brigands for not conforming to your agenda.\r\n\r\nI prefer a much simpler solution -- I just use free software. It's clear to me that there is more value in keeping with a free package than in locking myself into a commercial product that can be pulled out from under me. So why do we have to shake sabres about it?\r\n\r\nCopyright-monopoly based economics were successful for at least a couple of hundred years. It's not like slavery or institutionalized racism. It's just a system of doing business. In some regimes it apparently works for the benefit of the public, in others it doesn't. I happen to think it doesn't work very well for software. But that doesn't make it \"unethical\" to produce or buy proprietary software -- just unwise.\r\n"

    body: "While some view the GNU LGPL simply as a tactical license, the question the LGPL often finds itself in the middle of is that of what engineers perceive should be an \"aggregate\" work, but what copyright attorneys may state must legally be treated as a derived work.   As such, it actually falls along the fault line between the idea that \"my code is my code, and your code is your code\", the way software development often operates as a discipline, and the way our 16th century derived copyright laws defines the legal relationship between these different parties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
