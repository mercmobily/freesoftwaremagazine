If I were in his place, and a for-profit called me wanting support, I would say, \"Well, I would like to help you, but I'm neither willing or able to do it for free. Let's talk about a per/hour rate for providing professional tech support for my software.\"\r\n\r\n    Even Microsoft doesn't freely offer the level of support your friend is offering. I don't know anyone who does! I'd simply tell them to \"put up or shut up,\" and that'd be the end of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>Comment from: Maria Winslow [Member] Ã‚Â· http://windows-linux.com</strong>\r\n\r\n    2005-12-01 @ 15:27\r\n    That's what he's done, actually, and he is amazed by the degree of resistence he's getting.\r\n"
