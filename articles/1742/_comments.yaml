    body: "(It's probably a bad idea to submit my first comment just in between some competitions but I have to react...)\r\n\r\nI wonder: is this really necessary? Is a free desktop really that useful? Why should one be worried about free programs? I see some reasons:\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Economical ones: you are depending on one vendor, as in the Windows era. True, of course, but IMHO Flash, Java and PDF are open standards so you can change at any time. If users have a program that works better they don't care wether it's free or not.</li>\r\n<li>Ethical reasons: free software on free software systems (Linux, *BSD, ...). For companies this does not matter, they have to be legally okay anyway. For individuals this might be more important, but why? The regular user does not care. If you're really fanatic (perhaps this is a little bit exaggerated) you can live with the free alternatives I guess or you will avoid Flash for example.</li>\r\n<li>Legal reasons: most of the times those programs are licensed just enough for you to use them. Installing them in an easy way is of course difficult, but I reckon this stems from the fact that there are very few linux users.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nThese are just my 2 cents, most probably there are some gaps in the reasoning here. But that's what happens when you feel like reacting at 9am...\r\n\r\nBart\r\n"

    body: "Actually, if you don't ever â€œneedâ€? the software, it doesn't matter if it's free.\r\n\r\nThe problem with non-free software is that it can essentially be taken away from you at any time. This might not be technically true, but it can be rendered useless, can't be used on later platforms, and/or can't be distributed (depends on which non-free terms are in question).\r\n\r\nThis is basically what we call the â€œfuture proofingâ€? argument: software freedom removes the doubts associated with obsolescence, planned or otherwise.\r\n\r\nSo if it's just a toy, and you don't care if it goes away, then, no, it doesn't matter. Big companies, accustomed to a constant maintenance cash burn rate, and for whom all upgrades come down to cash, whether it's spent on outside licenses or inside training, may not care about the difference. For individuals and smaller businesses, where it is cash-flow, and not profit-or-loss that makes and breaks them, however, the difference is critical.\r\n\r\nBeing able to get what you need by working a little harder instead of blowing capital, is a very valuable option to have.\r\n\r\nSo, how critical are these technologies? If a flash viewer is only needed to watch cartoons on the web, then maybe it doesn't matter to you. But if you're an entertainment company maintaining a 20 year archive of cartoons, then you're being an idiot if you pick a proprietary storage format without a free viewer, because you're going to be paying through the nose for that choice for about 17-19 of those years.\r\n\r\nIn my experience, however, applications tend to drift towards greater and greater criticality, so just about any common technology that only exists in proprietary form is a threat to my future freedom.\r\n"

I have no apps in Java, also I'm pretty happy that my browser will not load ~20MB plugin runtime to run something like... like what exactly? I don't know (and use) any website/service that relies on Java right now. Java is obsolete for me.\r\n\r\nFlash - this is a big one for me. I just need it. I couldn't go without it. There are loads of things in Flash that I just need to see. Youtube for example. :) Too bad Flash on Linux is now pretty awkard (old plugin version using old ABI).\r\n\r\nPDFs - I use Acrobat Reader. Ghostscript is nice but all it can do is just render a file and maybe add few links to it. It is more to PDFs than that (like JavaScript in them, forms and stuff). PDF is a really nice and *open* format. You shouldn't be bashing Adobe for releasing their Reader software in recent version for Linux. You *should* be instead asking FOSS community where is the support for all features that PDFs offer in Free Software readers. It just not here, and this is in fact some cool and usefull stuff.\r\n\r\nAs for other things? How about media codecs (MP3, Windows Media, Quick Time, Real etc.) - these are big issues.\r\n\r\nPS. Och and OOo 2.x is not based on Java, some features do. But do you use them anyway? You can in most cases use OOo without Java and it will be much snappier."

    body: "I personally don't need the constitutional protection of a free press or free speech. I don't publish, I don't give public speeches - so why should I need free speech? \r\n\r\nI like to give this as an answer to people who say that they don't need open source / free software, because they are not programmers and would never dream of looking at the source code or modifying it. They say that they are simply users of off-the-shelf products.\r\n\r\nI am both a consumer/user of publications (newpapers, TV, radio) as well as software. I believe it is very important for a democratic society that those people who need the protection of free press/speech (journalists, publishers, etc.) have it, even if I personally don't need it. In the same way I think it is important that a system of free/open source software exists for those who need/want it, even if I personally don't need it.\r\n\r\nMy personal needs (and even those of the majority) don't necessarily determine what is good for society. Only a small fraction of the population personally needs protected free speech or free/open source software. However, the general existence of such freedoms is a pillar of a free and democratic society.\r\n"

No YouTube support yet, but they're working on it. What will be very nice about it will be its ability to make use of hardware acceleration for antialiasing - a big CPU consumer since it's done in software in the Adobe plugin.\r\n\r\nPDFs: Ghostscript can do forms as far as I know, now. Moreover, I had a problem with Reader: it would silently crash on my system upon printing, without giving an error message. I had to reformat my system, nothing else would make it work again. It started failing overnight - so I now stick to Ghostscript. Note: GhostScript is first and foremost a Postscript (layout language) interpreter; Javascript (script/interaction language) support is actually independant from it, and would in fact have to be embedded in the viewer, not in Ghostscript itself; so later version of, say, gv, or Kghostview, are to blame there (and I think at least some of them integrate JS support; Kghostview would be a safe bet, since it can call upon KHTML's JS support). I was talking about error correction, font replacement and printer compatibility in my post over anything else.\r\n\r\nOOo 2.0 makes use of Java for its database frontend and used it to display full-screen presentations (I think it doesn't require Java for that any more). For version 2.0.0, lack of the Sun JVM meant quite a lot of crippling (no fullscreen, no spellcheck, no merged documents); it got much better in 2.0.2 (added gcj support and reduced reliance upon Java) and 2.0.3 (more of the same).\r\n---\r\nA computer is like air conditioning: it becomes useless when you open windows."

The codecs for many formats was in i386 code.  And that was a problem, becouse it doesn't run i386 code, it's an ARM architecture.  It's capable to do lots of fun stuff, like distributing different media and such.  But emulating a i386 with speed to convert media formats is not one of those.\r\nSo, yes, it has more use to be able to run Linux desktop, not just for desktops...\r\n\r\nJust my â‚¬0.02"

    body: "I do hear where you're coming from and it's a popular refrain, but it's really a bit of a false analogy. Printing presses cost money, so the fact that publishing software costs money -- even per copy -- isn't really a restriction to freedom in that sense: you are still free to pay a license to use the software, just as you are free to purchase a printing press. I know the FSF has waged a long war against this interpretation, but it doesn't make it false: the primary effect of free licenses is to make per-copy license fees untenable.\r\n\r\nNowhere does it say that you have to be given a printing press for free.\r\n\r\nLikewise, it doesn't immediately follow that access to development of software must be available for free.\r\n\r\nAnd if you don't think that's the point (\"Free as in speech, not as in beer!\") then ask yourself this: if a company gave you full access to the source code for every package, and the right to redistribute the results of your work as long as 1) you paid them a per-copy fee for each copy of the source code, and 2) you paid them a royalty on each copy of your modified version of the software, and 3) you had to use a compiler which also cost money per-copy -- would you still call that \"free software\"?  You'd have all of your \"four freedoms\" -- except that you'd have to pay for them all.\r\n\r\nThat's another reason why I think the \"free as in speech, not as in beer\" slogan is disingenuous: \"free as in speech\" may be the ideal, but without the \"free as in beer\" part, it's still a non-starter.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it's easy to see the benefit of having a free tool for publication, as it enables much more speech for a broader community of speakers and furthers the ideal of free speech.\r\n\r\nThat's why I prefer to speak of free software in terms of \"ideals\" rather than some rigid system of \"rules\". The freedom promoted is a social ideal, not a fundamental right -- zealous propaganda aside. Still, I'm willing to work pretty hard for such a social ideal.\r\n\r\nBut I think people who claim to be \"fighting\" for the \"right\" of free software are really just grandstanding. There is no such fundamental right, any more than there is a fundamental right to copyright protection itself. They're just social choices that promote one or more ideals of society. Which ones do you like better? Which serve the public good better?\r\n\r\nThey both provide incentives and penalties for consumers and producers both.\r\nWhich one is a better bargain for society?  Fortunately, the miracle of the copyleft free licensing scheme is that it prevents you from having to choose once and for all for all society: free licenses create protected zones within an existing copyright regime where free-licensed open source software innovation can happen.\r\n\r\nThis is on a completely different level from the freedom of speech, which <em>is</em> fundamental. Indeed, the freedom of speech <em>includes</em> the right to write and publish software, whether through the per-copy fee-based system of traditional copyright or through the freely shared systems of copyleft or non-copyleft distribution.\r\n\r\nOn the other point, if this was in any way directed at my earlier post, I should probably have said \"it is needed\" rather than \"you need it\" -- the emphasis was on the fact that the importance of the freedom of the software is correlated to how much it's needed. If it's just a toy that has no real extensive value, then it doesn't really matter.\r\n\r\nBut how many software packages are promoted as \"just a toy\", and how many stay that way, even if they start out there? Software freedom is an important value in just about any package. And that's adequate reason to go 100% free in my opinion, even when that's not always easy (and sometimes costs more money in hardware).\r\n\r\nIt's also part of the reason why we need copyright term limits and the public domain: it's one thing for fluffy television entertainment to be restricted by per-copy fees, but it's a whole different matter for the classic works of literature that form the fabric of our society to be so limited. The recent (that is, over the last 30 years) extensions to copyright have unnecessarily retarded our society by locking up culture in a way that makes the real and natural evolution of that culture difficult, and locks out all but an oligarchy of \"producers\" from the right to extend and develop our culture.\r\n\r\nSo ideals are important, but they shouldn't be confused with natural rights.\r\n"
