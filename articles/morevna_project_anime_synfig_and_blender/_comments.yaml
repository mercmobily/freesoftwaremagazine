    body: "Great article, very interesting subject matter. Well done giving this important project and its software stack exposure.\r\n\r\nI was unaware of synfig, despite the fact that I have researched FOSS animation tools in the past and am a daily user of inkscape.\r\n\r\nIt'll be tough getting the project to completion, and then getting meaningful exposure. However, trailblazing teams like this one thrash out a path for other future endeavours, and are critical for making Free methods of production a conscious option for those in, and at the periphery of, the biz."
