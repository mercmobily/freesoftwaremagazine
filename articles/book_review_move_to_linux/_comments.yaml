    body: "From: Brian Masinick\r\nUrl: http://home.comcast.net/~masinick/\r\nDate: 2006-01-30\r\nSubject: Good review\r\n\r\nI was given this book by Dave Crouse, who runs the USALUG - an Internet run Linux User's Group. I skimmed through the book and I basically agree with you that this book is easy to read, is useful for the beginner, but probably too basic for the really experienced administrator. Still, the writing style is good, unless you really take offense to the kind of work that Marcel writes in his column, \"Cooking With Linux\" over at The Linux Journal\". Marcel is a bit more restrained in this book than he is in the monthly column (no wine cellar with Francois in this book) but he does occasionally interject light humor into a work designed to make the novice feel comfortable.\r\n\r\nAll in all, a work worth picking up if you are a total beginner up to an intermediate user, probably a waste of time for the ten year Linux veteran, and worth a look in the bookstore for someone in between.
