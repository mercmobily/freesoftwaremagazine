Dear subscriber,

By now, you should have received your first Free Software Magazine newsletter.  We hope you enjoyed it!Please let us know if you have any comments or criticisms - we promise we'll listen carefully.

Free Software Magazine will still exist (and will always be available for free in PDF and in HTML format); you will receive a notification email when a new issue comes out. As a subscriber, you will also have access to a high resolution version of every issue of Free Software Magazine. Please remember that every subscriber will receive our newsletters!

Newsletters will allow Free Software Magazine to exist and prosper for many years to come. They are available in HTML and in TXT format - you can change your settings by clicking on the link at the bottom of this email. At the moment, we are planning on releasing one newsletter every one or two weeks. We are putting a lot of effort in creating first class content; in fact, our newsletters are indeed fully edited articles about free software and the free software movement.

Thank you for your support,

Tony Mobily
