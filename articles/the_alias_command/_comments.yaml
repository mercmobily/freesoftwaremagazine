I was hoping to be able to do something like this:\r\n\r\n<code>alias locatemusic='slocate -i \"$1\" | grep \"/home/public/audio/\"'</code>\r\n\r\nBut yeah, that doesn't work. Any other way of doing this?\r\n\r\n------\r\nlet's all play nice!"

    body: "rather than symlinking, you could simply add an addition to your PATH variable:\r\n\r\nPATH=$PATH:~/bin\r\nexport PATH\r\n\r\nJust add the above lines to your .bashrc/.profile and then create a \"bin\" directory in your user's home. Toss your scripts in ~/bin and they'll work without you having to muck about in /usr/bin as root."
