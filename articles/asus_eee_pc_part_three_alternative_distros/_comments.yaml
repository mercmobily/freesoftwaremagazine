    body: "I'm a complete linux newbie but love my new eeepc 1000. I have tried several live distros (presently, I favour eeebuntu or super ubuntu). I'm wary of installing permanently as I am not sure how to handle the 8 + 32gb SSD's. Presumably the install goes on the 8gb and 'home' on 32gb. But the 8gb is in two partitions. Can you give me any advice on how to handle the install? I'm concerned if I do  it wrong I'll 'brick' my eee.\r\n\r\nI loved your four parter on the eee but have been unable to find the link to part four.\r\n\r\nfrom now on......Linux rules\r\nMel\r\n"
