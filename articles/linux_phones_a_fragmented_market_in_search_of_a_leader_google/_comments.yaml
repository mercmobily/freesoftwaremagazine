They grow with the need of market, or die with lack of it.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is slow(/maybe), but it runs in constant rhythm.\r\n\r\n\r\nGnome_VS_KDE's are separated in many streams of development, and I can't imagine one project that will unite them under one barrier.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the end I just want to say, that is natural as Evolution is.\r\nThe strongest, most fitted applications will survive while weak and bugged ones will be extincted without unnatural protection of monopole and power."

    body: "I guess the discussion about fragmentation in the GNU/Linux world of mobile phones is about the same as in the PC world. On one hand fragmentation weakens each single project, on the other hand it spurs competition, diversity and allows for different technological approaches. As the mobile market will grow (and I completely agree with you that our PCs will soon disappear in our pockets) more contributors and more money will be put into GNU/Linux development for mobile platforms. We just have to hope that until those initiatives have caught up and become usable on the consumer market, it's not too late.\r\n\r\nApple is on the verge of establishing a monopoly on mobile computing for the masses with the iPhone as they did with the iPod for mp3-players, similar to what Microsoft Windows/Office is on the desktop today. The iPhone is really a very capable device under massive development and 3rd-party apps are under way. (and it includes basically an iPod, so I don't see why your friend is still carrying an iPod touch with him, too.) But the iPhone runs a proprietary Mac OS X and is a piece in the DRM-crippled iTunes Music/Movie Store and iPod/Apple TV ecosystem (now people can buy/rent DRMed media from Apple directly from their TV, their iPhone/iPod touch and their iTunes-running PC - everything interoperable with each other, but closed for non-Apple devices).\r\nBut what is more, the iPhone represents a new generation of computers which the consumer rather rents than buys (like DRM-encrypted media, too): you need to have a running contract with one of the few cellular network operators which Apple allows to sell and operate their ipHones with (there's only one per country, in the U.S. it's AT&T). If you don't have a contract with such a monopoly-provider, you can't use your iPhone (you can try to hack it, but this is cumbersome and time-consuming). Finally, Apple chose to sell a software upgrade for the iPod touch for 20$ (consisting of Mail, Maps, Stocks, Notes and Weather Applications) rather than offering a free update with those apps that were available for the iPhone already some time before. Without doubt, this strategy of selling software updates and additional functionality will continue with iPhone an other locked-down devices.\r\n\r\nConsidering this, I really do hope that some folks get busy developing open and free (as in freedom) GNU/Linux-based alternatives. And they need to be powerful, user-friendly and have a sexy user interface. Google with its massive power seems quite promising, but I don't get why their Android platform is based on Java?! The Android FAQ states that all apps need to be written in Java. Does that include that Doom demo in the video?? It doesn't seem to me that Java uses those computing resources in mobile devices very efficiently..."

    body: "Guess I couldn't disagree with you much more than I do.\r\n\r\nIt is <em>libraries</em> that matter in the free software world, not <em>applications</em>. Because source code is freely available, applications always follow the libraries onto popular platforms.\r\n\r\nFor example, Maemo was a \"new\" platform, different from the desktop Gnome system. Yet, literally hundreds of free software applications migrated quickly to Maemo because it supported GTK+ and Python / PyGame libraries out of the box. Maemo uses different <em>binaries</em> than (for example) Ubuntu on x86, but the source code is mostly the same.\r\n\r\nYou <em>will</em> see abiword.deb for Ubuntu, a different abiword.deb for Maemo, an abiword.apk for Android, etc. So what? You install applications on free software platforms from the <em>repository</em> - they're custom-built for your platform, and install with the click of a mouse, so they always give a great user experience and work great!\r\n\r\nProprietary platforms like iPhone are problematic because they are <ul>not</ul> free, but free platforms thrive in spite of - or, I suspect, <em>because</em> of - their diversity. This diversity enables them to better target evolutionary niches missed by the \"mainstream\" proprietary products. And the freely available source code for free applications mean they'll be there for you, same great software, regardless of the platform you choose.\r\n\r\nYes, I love freedom. It's the future. Well, it's <em>my</em> future, regardless of whether the masses choose it or not. :-)\r\n"
