Welcome to the June edition of the Free Culture events newsletter. Free Culture is a movement that extends the logic of free software into the world of art, advocating free creativity, sharing and remixing. There will be thousands of events with this ethos going on around the world, but the listings below are brought to you by activists and advocates of the free culture movement. You can add your events and reviews to this newsletter on the [Free Culture UK newsletter wiki](http://www.freeculture.org.uk/CategoryNewsletter).
