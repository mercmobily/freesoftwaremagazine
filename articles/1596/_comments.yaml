    body: "I imagine explaining the concept of lack of net neutrality would be like having everyone pay taxes to have roads, as you note, and yet then if you own a book store, or people drive to your house, having to also pay for letting everyone drive to visit you.  This is not the same as pay as you browse model, which, incidently, could actually be considered \"net neutral\" assuming destinations were not descriminated against and the fees were not based on what/where you browsed.  Ultimately, the lack of enforced net neutrality will mean that service providers can also choose to stop or block traffic entirely, as well as slow it down to mingingless levels.  The service providers are actually seaking something much more like the mob extortion business model of \"you have a nice web site here, it would be a shame if something were to happen to all your bandwidth...\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
