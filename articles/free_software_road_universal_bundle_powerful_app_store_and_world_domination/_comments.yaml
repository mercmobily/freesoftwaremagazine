    body: "\"Every complying distribution\". :-D\r\n\r\nI think a real response is going to require a full post, but as long as you're okay with excluding \"non-compliant\" distributions, your description is very nearly met by any of the major binary package distributions.\r\n\r\nThe \"app store\" environment, in fact, sounds very much like Linspire's CNR, which was basically just an extension of what GUI APT tools like Synaptic provide. The \"Ubuntu Software Center\" retains some of these concepts.\r\n\r\nThe differences get down to pretty fine engineering choices, and I'm not convinced that switching to a single-directory/per-user model would really help with the dependency and compatibility problems."

    body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nTerry, I really think that this goes _way_ beyond an engineering issue. It's a philosophical issue more than anything else. The limitations that are a clear consequence of the current \"package management\" system are too far-reaching (I listed them in the article). And no, they cannot be fixed. Per-user installation, root password requirement, multi-architecture, etc. (see the article for the details :D )\r\n\r\nMy idea does not involve pigs and lipstick. It involves a clear design and a neat way of doing something.\r\n\r\nBye,\r\n\r\nMerc."

    hostname: 62.140.212.3
    created: '1294238601'
    body: "I'm not convinced by this idea. For one, splitting \"GUI user\" apps into an app-store while I presume leaving server apps to be managed by apt-get or whatever seems a little fraught with danger to me. It sounds good on paper/screen but in practice things are not that clear cut. I run a couple of development machines which have both GUI user apps and server apps on them. Managing such a machine becomes fragmented and troublesome in the environment you suggest. Yes that's my lookout but I choose my distro carefully depending upon the machine and I think a lot of other people do as well.\r\n\r\nSecondly who manages the app-store. Implied within your idea is the concept that the end-user will expect any application they get from the app-store to \"just work\" once it is installed. So who determines whether and when applications are fit for release? In the case of the OSX store that will be Apple (and we've seen the problems associated with that). For Android that is Google (again with associated issues - witness Creative's attempts to get their tablet approved to use the store). So who manages the free software app-store? Who decides whether an app is ready and how they are categorised? Right now these decisions are made by distributions and the criteria differs greatly. Ask the users of Debian, Mint and gNewSense if they can come to a common consensus.\r\n\r\nThis is an interesting concept but I think that is all it can and should be. As Terry appears to be suggesting the real problem with any idea like this will be getting distribution buy-in. Not just the popular ones but the smaller ones as well.\r\n\r\n--\r\nEquitas IT Solutions - fairness, quality, freedom\r\nhttp://www.equitasit.co.uk"

It couldn't be worse and regardless of how any GNU/Linux app store would be implemented it would not be hobbled by the restrictions listed in the article. Whatever else Apple have done right with the iPad seems not to have been replicated in their new Mac OS X app store.\r\n\r\nToshiba will be bringing out their own (bigger) version of the iPad later this year, featuring Honeycomb (Android 3) customised especially for tablets. That, in my opinion will be where free and open apps come into their own rather than on conventional distros on desktops and laptops."

As I said above somebody needs to manage an app-store - even one for free software. Whilst a free software \"store\" would not be run along the same lines, this incident highlights the issues with such a service. If you are a dictator like Apple then you can do what you want (as long as you sell it as a benefit). if you are running a community service then you can't and pretty soon you'll end with death-by-committee.\r\n\r\n--\r\nEquitas IT Solutions - fairness, quality, freedom\r\nhttp://www.equitasit.co.uk"
