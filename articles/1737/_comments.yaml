    body: "<cite>\"Do you like gallery tools such as Flickr, but want to control your photos, or get rid of any of their limits?\"</cite>\r\n\r\nSorry to ask but, how in earth will Picy be a contender of Flickr?\r\n\r\nThere are at least 10 that are as easy as this to install, with or without database backend (sometimes with both like Singapore), in PHP, Perl, Python or Ruby and that are really very powerfull and able to be thought as potential Flickr replacements.\r\n\r\nA few examples, some with almost the same features than Picy but, at least, much better presented:\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://fennecfoxen.org/pyxy/gallery\">Pyxy</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://forge.novell.com/modules/xfmod/project/?ajallerix\">Ajallerix</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://www.ben3w.com/multimedia/devphp_2bgal.php\">2bGal</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://coppermine-gallery.net/\">Coppermine</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://gallery.menalto.com/\">Menalto Gallery</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://www.zenphoto.org/\">ZenPhoto</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://www.gregphoto.net/gcards/\">gCards</a> (not quite a Gallery)</li>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://www.sgal.org/\">Singapore</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://labs.thesonicgroup.net/projects/Snaps!/i\">Snaps!</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://spgm.sourceforge.net/\">Simple Picture Gallery Manager</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://photostack.org/\">PhotoStack</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://www.instantphotogallery.com/\">Instant Photo Gallery</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://www.plogger.org/features/\">Plogger</a></li>\r\n</ol>\r\nNot even to mention the several integrations from some of the above galleries with the blog system Wordpress or any other integrations that turn many of this applications full fledge tools coparable with services like Blogger. I just mention three below.\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://photoblogger.halof.de/\">PhotoBlogger</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://www.pixelpost.org/\">PixelPost</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://www.view-sw.com/birch/\">Birch</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://folderblog.org/\">FolderBlog</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\nAnd this is not a \"mine is better\" flame war. I don't believe in those kind of wars and those links above are not sorted by any particular reason. \r\n\r\nFree Software offer us so much variety with upmost quality that the dificulty is what to choose, even in what regards such simple programs like Picy.\r\n\r\nThis is a good example of a script to make a gallery fast, I agree. But it is not something that we will offer to someone Flickr'ed and non Free Software savvy instead of his/her precious tool. And this magazine, has I understood it, is for the general public, right?\r\n\r\nSorry to say this but yours, although well intended I'm sure, is the kind of article that gives bad name to Free Software when presenting it as something so naive and not at all professional.\r\n\r\nSorry if I sound hursh but my english is not as round as it would be if I knew more of it ;)\r\n\r\nBest"

    body: "Web photo gallery apps are a dime a dozen, actually. This is one of the most common things you'll see if you regularly scan Freshmeat announcements. Another is full-fledged CMS systems.\r\n\r\nI used Zope, combined with my own 'VarImage' scalable image object for Zope to create my own highly flexible photo galleries. It's so simple to make a gallery using a combination of Zope Folders and VarImage that it's hardly worth trying to package it as a gallery product (not to mention the huge amount of competition). I liked the flexibility of writing the page templates and scripts for each site, so I never saw much point in creating a \"gallery product\".  I use VarImage everywhere, though, and have set my Zope instances up to use it as the default image object.\r\n\r\n(You can get VarImage from my SourceForge site: \r\n<a href=\"http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=99506&package_id=106720\">VarImage Release Page</a> ).\r\n\r\nI originally created it as a utility for a CMS system I was working on, but it was easy to package and a few other people have found it useful. Basically, it treats the image as a directory name, and the file name within the directory is actually a command to generate the image. It caches command calls internally in a fairly conservative way so that regens happen almost never in practice (but are handled automatically if you change the referring page). Version 2.4 added a number of limiting features to avoid obvious DoS attacks and other abuses. It also got the referer blocking to work correctly.  There's a plugin architecture so you can define new operations that can be performed. The distribution includes obvious things like scaling, cropping, the foveal cropping algorithm (the main use for galleries), color conversions, composition with \"sub-images\", drop-shadow, and\r\nso-on. The referer blocking can throw an error, deliver an alternate image, or deliver the same image with reduced size, color, or a watermark.\r\n\r\nOf course, it only works in Zope, but it's handy. ;-)\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Thankfully free software gives extreame diversity, which a dozen plus project for any task.\r\n\r\nThanks for taking the time to respond.  Also, I'd like to note I wanted to have this as newbie friendly as possible, and to be a single user solution.  For a single user, this can make a nice flickr like gallery from a folder of photos with zero config, even though it it's as powerful as flickr, it has no upload limits :)\r\n\r\nThanks again,\r\nRobin"
