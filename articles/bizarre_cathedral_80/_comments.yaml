To be honest I have been thinking about this for a little while myself but rather than just reproduce the strips as they have appeared in FSM I might see if adding some colour works. Some are in colour as it is but the Mutt's t-shirt will always be a faded black one ;).\r\n\r\nThe 100th strip seems a good target to aim for. I'm also working on a Comic Strip Plasmoid plug-in for KDE as well. Watch this space as they say.\r\n\r\n--\r\nEquitas IT Solutions - fairness, quality, freedom\r\nhttp://www.equitasit.co.uk"
