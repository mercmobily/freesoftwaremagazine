    body: "In your article you mention not being able to ask Facebook for the information they hold about you.  Under British Law, The 1998 Data Protection Act, any firm which holds information by which you can be identified (phone number, address, name + age) must hold that data in compliance with certain government legislation and must hold an Information Controller License.  They must also be prepared to remove, or show you information, they hold about you on request.\r\n\r\nThanks for a good article!"

    body: "I think the UK law will only apply to cases where the data/company is in the UK. That said Facebook would be stupid if they tried to argue that point because they'd annoy their Brit customers.\r\n\r\nI mean that would be going against the DPA, akin to something like -- oh I don't know -- [not providing data removal services after somebody closes their account](http://www.channel4.com/news/articles/science_technology/facebook%20data%20protection%20row/1060467) :o)\r\n\r\ncheers  \r\nRyan"
