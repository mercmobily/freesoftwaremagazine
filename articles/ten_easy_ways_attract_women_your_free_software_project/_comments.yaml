    body: "These aren't new statistics of course -- they were collected a couple of years ago. But I don't think there's been a lot of good ideas about what to do about them. People know it's bad, but they don't know how to respond to it.\r\n\r\nThis article started as a series of design notes that I was collecting for my own use in creating a better, more inclusive system to encourage more people to participate in development processes. I wasn't _particularly_ interested in women's requirements -- I just wanted to \"assess user needs\" and find practical and tested design ideas.\r\n\r\nI am in fact writing another article (the next in the [Making the Impossible Happen...](http://www.freesoftwaremagazine.com/books/making_the_impossible_happen_the_rules_of_free_culture) series) about community design to encourage \"an atmosphere of productive leisure\", which is more general in scope. Which is why I'm publishing this now.\r\n\r\nBut it was a fact that most of the other communities I was studying for ideas were much more representative (some were about 50% women or even more). Also, there were some features or technologies that women used more than men (and vice versa). So the software certainly can be \"gendered\" (as Yuwei Lin puts it).\r\n\r\nLater, I was made aware of the FLOSSPOL statistics and the various women's involvement projects ([Debian Women](http://women.debian.org/home/), [LinuxChix](http://www.linuxchix.org/) (which has the best FS logo _ever_, BTW), [etc](http://www.linuxchix.org/other-groups-women-free-software.html)) through news sources, and I too was floored by the statistics (the FLOSSPOLS reference, BTW, contains a lot more detail than this. I don't recommend reading the whole thing, but the summaries are well worth your time).\r\n\r\nStudying the reports, I saw confirmation of most of the trends I had noticed from watching the online behavior of men and women in different online environments, and I felt it was time for an article focused on the gender issue. At first I was a little self-conscious about writing this as a man (\"what do I know about it?\"), but the more I got into it, the more important it seemed (which is why this post became so huge).\r\n"

    body: "Thanks for an interesting article and for the FLOSSPOL reference.\r\n\r\nWhile I can agree with some of the recommendations - for example, I'm all in favor of courtesy and of giving generous credit to writers of documentation - I'm wary of replacing mailing lists with web forums, deep threading with flat threading, solitary programming with team programming, et cetera, simply on the basis of perceived female preferences.\r\n\r\n When we talk about what women want, we need to specify the population in question: different women want different things. And a project leader may rightly care more about the desires of women who've already paid their dues, wrestled their way through the manuals, and arrived at a position to contribute than about the perceived preferences of women in general.\r\n\r\nIt might also be useful to broaden the discussion to consider women not only as contributors to existing OSS projects, but also as originators of such projects. One problem I've run into is a lack of coding capability and open-source awareness in the (overwhelmingly female) group of end users to whom my particular programs might be useful.\r\n\r\nI have a background in both math and art, and, over the years, I've taught myself to program in C++, Java, and Python (with forays into Perl and Gimp's Lisp-based scripting language) by writing software for textile design. I've always been more than willing to share my source code. But the knowledgeable, code-contributing end-user audience on which open-source projects depend just doesn't seem to exist in the textile-design field. Instead there are countless people eager to hand over money for proprietary software like Adobe PhotoShop, Adobe Illustrator, SymmetryShop, and SymmetryWorks but dismissive (when not ignorant) of open-source alternatives like Inkscape and Gimp. I'm not a marketing person or natural proseletizer; I don't have the time or the talent to run a one-person campaign for OSS (let alone for my own efforts) within the largely technophobic textile community. Thus I've always wound up code that's useful to me, but not really promising as an open-source project.\r\n\r\nMy mistake, if it is a mistake, has been to tackle problems of interest to an audience for whom open-source and programming in general seem to hold little appeal. Had I applied my efforts to problems in a stereotypically male field (e.g., gaming rather than textile design), I might not have encountered such isolation. It's possible that female developers willing to share their source code will gain more visibility (not to mention social and emotional support) as women in general become less technophobic, more open-minded, and more receptive to open-source.\r\n\r\nI don't have experience contributing to other people's OSS projects, and so I can't comment directly on that. But I have been reading online technical discussions since 1992 and Slashdot since its inception (admittedly, mostly lurking rather than posting). Much as I dislike flames, acrimony, and Asperger-ish behavior, I've often found these conversations more nurturing and emotionally \"safe\" (to me as a whole thinking human being) than the online talk I've encountered in female-dominated milieus (the LinuxChix groups being a welcome exception to this rule). So, I'd urge caution in reframing OSS development practices to be more \"social\" and less task-oriented. (Just my two cents, of course.)\r\n\r\nMany other interesting points were raised in this article - wish I had more time to comment. Thanks again. "

    body: "Thanks for a considered response.\r\n\r\nI agree that you can go too far with a focus on social involvement. However, I do think that this is _already_ a major motivator for people to be involved in free software projects, though it is conspicuously missing from lists of reasons for involvement that I have read, and I think that the current environment is very male-centric in the forms of social gratification it grants. Paying some attention to the way women (in general) deal with these needs will make the whole more balanced in my opinion -- and not just for women, but to a wider variety of male participants as well.\r\n\r\nIt's also true that for any particular project you must consider the needs and makeup of the community it's meant to serve, and that means looking beyond gender generalities. \r\n\r\nI wonder though if such a web community approach wouldn't have been perfect for _your_ project? Aren't you in the position of trying to motivate people with textile expertise and limited programming skill to become more involved with programming and using free software?\r\n\r\nI had a very similar problem with my own project [The Light Princess](http://light-princess.org), because that project depended so heavily on artwork and music. I wasn't selling free software developers on making art and music; I was selling artists and musicians on the value of free software. Obviously, the project was not terribly successful as a whole, but I did find people willing to contribute (about 50% women, as a point of interest). _Not one of the artists ever joined the mailing list_ -- they would pass stuff directly to me, and I would post it for consideration. Nowadays I would've set up a wiki for that, but that was pretty new technology in 2000. If I ever get the game engine software to run, I will probably revive the project following a strategy similar to what I've outlined here. Then I guess we'll see if it works.\r\n\r\nAlso, if your project has to do with creating textile pattern graphics, I would like to personally invite you to participate in [Linux Graphics Users](http://linuxgraphicsusers.com) where I think this should be on topic (probably under vector graphics? -- I'm guessing you're doing something akin to CAD). My username there is \"Digitante\". Of course, it is a _users_ forum, but I know we'd be interested. Also, my mother is both an expert in needlecraft and a Linux user, so she'd certainly be _interested_ in free software tools for textile work, though I don't know how equipped she'd be to contribute. I'd love to be able to recommend your software to her, if you could let us know where to find your project.\r\n\r\nWe face the same problems with all artistic and even engineering software packages -- the primary users usually have a limited interest or expertise in programming. I'm also seeing the same kind of problems with Open Hardware projects for things like \"electronics design automation\" (EDA) and \"computer aided design\" (CAD).\r\n\r\nBut while that is clearly not a gender issue, it does hold up the value of keeping the gate open for potential contributors with low-confidence in programming and hesitancy to join into the developers' discussion. If you make the slope between users and developers a little more graded, you may be able coax some of those folks to cross. There are ways to make use of their core skills while minimizing the software knowledge they need (e.g. build in easy scripting for adapting the software to more complex design problems), and that's probably the key to making it happen.\r\n\r\nIOW: It's probably easier to adapt your process to your users, than your users to your process.\r\n"

    body: "The idea of a navigable slope between end-users and developers holds enormous appeal, I think, for anyone who believes in open-source. Thus, any measure that helps users take part in development (e.g., a wiki, or hooks into the program that allow for scripting add-ons/plugins) deserves consideration. But some end-user communities operate at such a remove from some development projects that direct communication is nearly impossible. In some cases no wiki or scripting language or change of social customs is quite enough to bridge the gap.\r\n\r\nConsider, for example, the ImageMagick suite of command-line tools for cropping, combining, and transforming bitmapped images. It's fast, powerful, and wonderfully flexible, with a dazzling (and initially daunting) array of options. I was thrilled, years ago, when I first stumbled across it. At that point I'd been active for years in the online textile community, connected to thousands of artists and craftspeople with image-processing needs. It says something, I think, that I first learned about ImageMagick not from fellow artists and craftspeople, but rather from a listed dependency in some other graphics program (can't remember which) that I was trying to run or compile under Linux.\r\n\r\nWhile the ultimate end-users of ImageMagick may be artists with no interest at all in command-line tools, the intermediate users are programmers and writers of scripts. At this point ImageMagick has interfaces for incorporation into programs in C, C++, Java, Python, Ruby, Lisp, Tck/TK, etc., and I'm guessing it lies hidden under the hood of a great many graphics applications.\r\n\r\nWhat we're looking at in this success story, I think, is two distinct user/developer slopes: one connecting end-users with graphics application developers and another connecting these application developers with the developers of ImageMagick. Thus, the people who work on ImageMagick just have to produce a good command-line product; they don't have to get into all the subtleties of gui design and open-source promotion for the various end-user audiences. And they don't have to explain complicated ideas (all those concepts underlying the many ImageMagick options) directly to those who ultimately benefit from those ideas.\r\n\r\nThe ImageMagick people have been able to fit the project to the community, I think, because the relevant community for that project is not the ultimate end users but rather a fairly large group representing the intersection of three sets:\r\n\r\n(1) people with programming or at least command-line skills, \r\n(2) people interested in computer graphics, and \r\n(3) people who believe in the open-source development model.\r\n\r\nNo analogous group exists in the case of the suite of command-line utilities that I've been working on for textile design. In practice, this means that a successful textile design project needs to provide not only the core functionality (i.e., methods for combining multiple bitmapped and vector images into non-obvious repeat patterns in various colorways), but also a not-too-intimidating gui front end, plus end-user documentation, support, and \"marketing.\"\r\n\r\nI'm currently working on putting a web-hosted front end on a subset of my command-line utilities - the only way I can see to make my efforts useful to people who, overwhelmingly, don't install their own software, don't use Linux, don't read wikis (except Wikipedia), don't use the command line, and tend to fear (as a source of viruses, not to mention frustration) any product that isn't already well known or at least slickly packaged. The web 2.0 approach can get around these obstacles, but it does take extra effort: the effort of running a server, designing a web gui, and writing all the web code.\r\n\r\nPeople create software not just out of altruism or to learn new skills and improve their resumes, but also because they need tools to pursue their own core interests. In some cases the problem field isn't all that negotiable; it's the developer's primary concern and motivation. If the problems the software solves are of interest mainly to a specialized audience with a low threshhold for computer frustration, then the developer who wants to share his/her efforts and reach this audience may have to take on a lot of extra work.\r\n\r\nAt this point I'm willing to do that extra work, but only if I get at least some nominal payment. Thus, I plan to charge for some of the web-based services; that seems the necessary route to respect within the textile community. Meanwhile an ancient version of the core code is at patternand.org. I do plan to update it and write some documentation after I get the web-based services going.\r\n\r\nFinally, I'm delighted to hear your mother is using Linux; needlework-and-Linux stories are rare but always heartening. Thanks for the link to linuxgraphicsusers.com; the site seems very well-run with a good cross-section of users. "
