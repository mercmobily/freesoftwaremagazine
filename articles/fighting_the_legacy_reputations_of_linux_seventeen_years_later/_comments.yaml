    body: "So long as hardware manufacturers test their equipment with Windows (and not with GNU/Linux) before shipping, there's going to be a grain of truth in this \"myth\".\r\n\r\nMost equipment won't ever see the store shelves if it doesn't work with Windows, whereas Linux-compatibility is rarely seen as even a selling point worth mentioning on the box, much less a requirement.\r\n\r\nPrinter support is one of the nastier areas. The old lpr/lprng configurations are both finicky and arcane, and the new CUPS approach is confusingly implemented to say the least. For example, I have exactly one printer on my LAN, but CUPS thinks I have about _four_: all different reflections of the same printer.\r\n\r\nIt \"works\", so I haven't tried to \"fix\" it, but things do get weird whenever a print job fails, and I can't figure out which queue it's in. I usually just try rebooting things: the printer, the print server, my own computer. I know it's lame, but it does work, and it's less trouble than figuring out what the real problem was.\r\n\r\nI find myself missing my old lprng configuration: it was a major pain to set up, but once it worked, it _worked_. OTOH, there's no question that CUPS is the way ahead -- there's much better support for newer printers with it, and it _is_ easier to set up.\r\n"

    body: "As I've mentioned in this column before there's also a case where those manufacturers who do test their kit with GNU/Linux don't say so (HP Printers anyone?).\r\n\r\nWhilst it is true that _some_ hardware is more difficult to setup in GNU/Linux than in Windows -- it's also very true that Windows has plenty of hardware issues of it's own. Printers are one of the cases where I've had less issues with GNU/Linux - mostly by choosing GNU/Linux supporting manufacturers (HPLIP is excellent).\r\n\r\nSome time back I supported a friend who's son bought him a Vista laptop. We had a nightmare trying to get an external USB audio capture/output device working (he's a music teacher so this is much more than an iPod). The drivers on the CD were for XP and didn't work. Vista drivers were available on their website but required significant tweaking (uninstall old drivers, remove other hardware before installing this etc.) of Vista itself before they would work. Four hours it took me to get that working. Between the hardware manufacturer and Microsoft it was a complete mess. By chance I had my Debian laptop with me and attached the device to it. Debian detected it, loaded the driver and within minutes I was using it on Audacity."

    body: "Manufacturers shy away from admitting support for GNU/Linux.\r\nI have a Brother MFC665CW printer.  There was no hint of linux support until you get to the support/downloads part of their website.  There is a mention of linux which if looked into shows that they do indeed support it. They have GPL drivers for printing and scanning, haven't tried faxing. APT and RPM, both with install instructions.\r\nNot that it is perfect, can't get its IP address over wireless with DHCP and it hangs up every 2/3 weeks as if it were running wi......\r\nYou would think the support would be mentioned in the product documentation, bit no.  There should also be plently of room on the CD for the drivers - don't need the autostart to find them.\r\nAnd who made the decision that windows was ready for the workplace desktop?  A case of the clueless leading sheep?"

    body: "Yeah, I had a great experience with a \"midisport\" (it's a USB MIDI interface). Before I bought it, I did some searches online to see if there were drivers for Linux available and/or whether it would work.\r\n\r\nI did find them, but I attached the device to the computer first. And voila... it was totally plug-and-play. I was using it in Rosegarden in about five minutes (most of which was trying to figure out Rosegarden's interface -- I'm not a musician and I hadn't used it before. This was for my son, who _is_ a musician).\r\n\r\nApparently I didn't need anything beyond what was already installed. I haven't tried to look into the magic that made that happen, so I don't really know how difficult it was, but I do know it was a great relief.\r\n\r\nThere's a lot of stuff that \"just works\"."

    body: "I recently had a printer come through the office -- I'm pretty sure it was HP, but it could've been another brand -- and right next to the Windows logo and the half-chawed Apple sat a happy little penguin we all know.  That's a good sign.  Some folks are waking up and advertising Linux compatibility.\r\n\r\nThat's why it's good we're seeing things like Dell and Asus making Linux-preinstalled machines.  It means the Linux users out there are no longer people building things from scratch or voiding their warranties -- Linux users are regular people buying off-the-shelf products, and therefore indicating support for them is a selling point.  It will eventually come to that.\r\n\r\nI think that will help the broader issue as well.  From a consumer point of view, you can *expect* that a manufacturer will support Windows in its prevailing versions.  If they don't they won't sell products.  We can't *expect* them to support Linux.  We can demand that they do, but we're not going to put them out of business just yet.\r\n\r\nIt'll come, in time."

    body: "Quite a few years ago a colleague said that he would walk into the office and see someone totally engrossed and looking the model of productivity, then as he neared the person, he'd hear comments such as \"I thought I had saved that\", \"I'll reboot\", \"I've lost an hour's work\", etc. Yet such guys/gals would extol the virtues of Windows and tell how they have no problems with Windows, then in a moment, a transformation takes place where they would relate a number of problems they have had working with the same Windows.\r\nSometimes the perception of Linux is such that all problems are attributed to it - it's the way minds work. My own daughter who had been using Linux for a few years, came across a problem where she didn't know how to delete some files and requested Windows be reinstalled on her machine - easily fixed with a simple example. The latest encounter she had with a new laptop and Vista, the same printer she had plugged in to the Linux PC and just worked required much wading through CD's to find the driver. The laptop came with OpenOffice installed and she had a .doc form that needed filling in, but Vista said there was nothing available to open it with, so OOo on Linux came to the rescue.\r\nYou will always see that people are quite prepared to put up with all kinds of ills in Windows, but run for the cover of Windows at the first sign of the slightest perceived  problem on Linux, though I have a relation over 80 years old who got introduced to a PC 2 years ago not even knowing what the keyboard keys were or did, but uses Linux for all sorts of stuff - photo processing, word processing, burning CD's and DVD's, spreadsheets (had a Windows course for seniors after he got the the PC and I immediately installed Linux on it), IM, surfing the net, email and lots more, many things he discovered by himself. Not only that, his youngest daughter uses the Linux PC with her own account set up, for her college work having discarded use of her XP laptop which slowed right down perhaps with malware, spyware, viruses and the like. \r\nIt's taken a while for it to get through, but I now don't get calls asking what to do with the CD's that come with new hardware he buys. In the years since he's been using Linux, I've only had on problem to fix - he kept having problems with audio on skype and I had to play with settings to get it to work, eventually the on-board audio simply died, we ordered a new PCI card, I installed it and he set up the mixer. One happy Linux novice user out there and if he can do it at his age, most people should be capable also - Nice thing is he never refers back to Windows - when I renamed the icon to \"Mail\" on the desktop hoping to make it easy for him, he has never once referred to it as anything but \"thunderbird\" - my underestimation showing there.\r\n---\r\nLinux used for all computing tasks"
