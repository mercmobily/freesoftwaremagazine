I’ve often lamented the sad fact that there is not as much attention paid to GNU game development as there should be. It’s hard to be a diehard GNU/Linux user who is also into gaming. Though we look forward to days when more high profile games will be targeted at the GNU/Linux platform, it’s nice to know that [there are folks out there trying to ease the transition](http://www.joystiq.com/entry/1234000737070954/). This blog from Joystiq discusses the options for the GNU gamer and introduces crossover technologies like Wine and Cedega. I continue to insist that OS developers would do well to focus on these efforts and working hard to make life easy for would-be game developers. In the end, the OS with the most toys will win.
