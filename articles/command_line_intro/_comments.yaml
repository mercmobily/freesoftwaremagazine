Moving from DOS to linux is a humbling experience and mastery of a few simple commands (and understanding of similarities and differences between DOS and linux) feels like a first toe on the ladder.

You can record what have you type in terminal with script and replay back with scriptreplay. vim will be the next thing you wanna try after I start to dip your toe into CLI.\r\n\r\nA lots of fun stuff, you can get it cover at http://linux.byexamples.com"
