I believe this trick is described in the KDE documentation somewhere, don't remember where though.\r\n\r\nSometimes when browsing the you stumble upon an auto-indexed directory of pictures, like for example:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.debianadmin.com/images/etchkde/\r\n\r\nIn these situations you can turn Konqueror into a simple image browser like this:\r\n1. Split the view left/right\r\n2. Chain-link both views\r\n3. Activate the left view and then choose the \"View -> Lock to Current Location\" menu item.\r\n\r\nNow, when you click on a file in the left view it will show up in the right view, with the left view intact.\r\n"

You can restore them—just\r\n.  >point your browser here.\r\n\r\nbut the initial fix it gives is wrong for Kubuntu 7.10 Gutsy:\r\n.  eljefe@eljefe-desktop:~$ cp /usr/share/apps/konqueror/konqueror-orig.rc  ~/.kde/share/apps/konqueror/konqueror.rc\r\n.  cp: cannot stat `/usr/share/apps/konqueror/konqueror-orig.rc': No such file or directory\r\nThe command should read:\r\n.  eljefe@eljefe-desktop:~$ cp /usr/share/apps/konqueror/konqueror.rc  ~/.kde/share/apps/konqueror/konqueror.rc\r\n\r\nRegardless, this still leaves me with a very crippled Konqueror compared to my office computer, where I run with Debian.  Always makes me sad to see Kubuntu falling behind in resources and development... and then to add this insult?\r\n\r\nThanks for the rest of the read!"
