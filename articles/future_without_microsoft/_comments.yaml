    body: "The fact that the world of server is mainly UNIX is a pretty unsubstantiated claim. GNU/Linux took most of the market share of proprietary UNIX systems, but not much of the Windows server market. Right now Apache and Windows IIS are almost equally split in the server market. The claim that Microsoft is badly loosing ground to Linux server is misleading and somewhat wrong. Who's really loosing ground is the old Unix.\r\n\r\nAs for Android, I wish what you say is true. Unfortunately, Android is pretty much unexistent in the market, right now. It's a great platform but it has to prove itself as a leading platform. Windows Mobile may be a bad platform, but it still takes a significant part of the market. Apple is growing strong. The article forgets to mention the leading smartphone OS, Symbian. In this heavily competitive market, Android is still a promise. nothing more. \r\n\r\nI am a Linux user for years, I know how great Linux is and I advocate for it, but I am also very realistic. This article seems a lot like one of those \"200x is the year of desktop Linux\". Claiming that \"more and more people are installing Ubuntu\" is neither scientific, nor accurate. I would like to see a more serious article describing with real data, market penetration in different areas, over the year trends and an accurate description of the challenges that Linux as a platform have to overcome. Otherwise it's simply fanboism speculation.   "

However, I have walked through several data centres, and I have a friend (a contributor) who has a large hosting service (and I am not talking about Linux fanatics). People don't install NT servers. There aren't hard numbers available, but there is a lot of anecdotal evidence from all of us.\r\n\r\nAndroid is indeed \"just a promise\". However, I have to ask: have you _seen_ a \"pure\" Windows mobile PDA next to an iPhone? Windows Mobile is a joke. Believe me, if Windows Mobile weree a real competitor and was any good, I would say so. Android is a promise, but again, I can't really say much about it but I was lucky enough to see a prototype from April and well, there is a lot happening there too.\r\n\r\nThis article is definitely speculation, mainly because hard numbers are just impossible here.

    body: "It's been a few years since I checked into this, but counting Windows versus Linux servers is sort of tricky. They tend to be used in very different environments:\r\n\r\nWindows servers are typically installed by small businesses, because they don't want to hire dedicated Unix/Linux staff and they think it'll be easier to manage it all on one O/S. Also, they are accustomed to the Windows \"support\" model, and are more comfortable sticking to it. They generally will manage only one or two servers with one or two small sites on each. The administrator is probably much less skilled and probably doesn't work full time managing the servers.\r\n\r\nLinux servers, on the other hand, are usually the preference of network professionals at web-hosting companies or ISPs, and they typically will deploy huge mega-sites with many, many servers, often virtualized to provide many, many virtual servers on each, maintaining multiple websites. Free licensing of course, makes this much cheaper and easier to do legally.\r\n\r\nThese are often much more demanding applications, in terms of both load and application diversity.\r\n\r\nSo which is \"dominant\"? The little system that lots of people use for themselves or the big system that runs far more internet traffic? The best answer depends on why you want to know.\r\n\r\nOr to put it another way, it's probably not the right question.\r\n"

    body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nOK, but this is all speculation.\r\nIn my opinion, you are dead right. So... hang on a minute. So, we have two possibilities:\r\n\r\n* Half managed servers used because it's \"easy enough\" to set them up\r\n\r\n* Real servers that do the job for real\r\n\r\n...? Again, this is a generalisation, but this _is_ what I've seen quite a lot. But, there are more things that need to be considered:\r\n\r\n* Hosting companies are indeed offering Windows servers. Not many people are choosing them, but they are available\r\n\r\n* Linux servers are _very_ easy to install and configure nowadays. You can install Ubuntu and get Samba going in minutes.\r\n\r\nSo... it's still quite tricky. Especially when I have two friends who spend most of their working time replacing those Windows servers with \"real\" ones once the companies who deployed them lose all their data because there was no backup, or the backup was faulty, or the server simply starts behaving erratically.\r\n\r\nSo, maybe we can safely say that GNU/Linux and Unix in general has the majority of the \"real\" server market. By \"real\", I mean with a proper configuration, proper backup, a skilled person that deals with it, and decent hardware. A server can't miss any one of those things, in my opinion, to be considered \"real\".\r\n\r\nAgain, it's speculation. However, maybe we can say that GNU/Linux and Unix are dominant in the market of \"real\" servers. I am still happy.\r\n\r\nI am generally much more careful when I talk about \"speculative\" data. However, I've just seen too much not to voice my opinion. It's been years now: Windows is often used as a toy. I am aware that it _can_ be used seriously, but that's often not the case.\r\n\r\n(The amount of money in certifications you have to spend to _actually_ know what to do with a Windows server is yet another story) \r\n\r\nBye,\r\n\r\nMerc."

The trouble is that I don't remember a lot of the details of the measurement other than the conclusion that was drawn. I apologize for the lack of rigour!\r\n\r\nThe actual data (IIRC) was more like this: if you count by _websites_ you get a much higher number for Linux/Apache, but if you count by _servers_ you get a higher number for IIS/Windows.\r\n\r\nAs I write this, though, I'm looking at a pie chart I made up from 2007 data which shows Apache at 61% versus IIS at 31%. I suspect this means that a lot of the Apache servers are running on Windows, and it's the Linux versus Windows O/S stats that I'm remembering (But I hope this shows how ignoring a detail can skew the numbers one way or the other, depending on exactly what you try to compare).\r\n\r\nOf course, those studies I'm thinking of are old now, so the map can easily have changed. But I think the point stands that, since IIS and Apache (and Windows and GNU/Linux) generally serve different markets, that it's a bit difficult to compare them head-to-head.\r\n\r\nThus, it's possible to make the statistics say whatever you want, if you gloss over the details that differentiate them.\r\n\r\nAdd to that marketers on both sides who really want you to conclude one way or the other, and the whole thing really has to be taken with a whopping large chunk of salt.\r\n\r\n"

    body: "   While I may not be exposed to the mainstream business sector, I look at everyday, practical experience in the IT industry. I build and service small business systems in a fairly small area of the south. I have been a Linux user and IT consultant for several years. My experience with Linux and other *nix environments has shown a trend away from Microsoft based systems. I openly advocate Linux for small business with a great deal of success. Reduced down-time and system reliability are the major selling points. \r\n\r\n   Your argument that there is no \"scientific\" basis for the increase in Ubuntu Linux usage can be refuted by a quick look at www.distrowatch.com showing the number of downloads to date for each distro. Ubuntu leads the pack, and this is only for downloads, not counting requests for disks being shipped to users. The recent introduction of the Ubuntu remix for ultraportable laptops has added a new market for an already healthy OS. The fact that OEM's are approaching *nix companies for special dostro's shows a solid user base is in the works. I hardly think this is speculation.\r\n\r\n   Far be it from me to pronounce the doom of Microsoft, however, our free enterprise system has room for both *Nix and MS. The current market economy has placed most consumers in a bind financially and the reduced cost of *Nix will, I believe, have a major impact on Microsoft's market share."

However this part of the article (re: mobile devices and PDA) was really out of touch with reality. \r\n\r\nI understand that the author is in a kind of euphorical state about all things Linux (I like, use and contribute to open source software myself) but when was the last time you actually used the smart phone/PDA for more than calls? The WM appeal on the smart phones and PDAs is *not* in the beauty of its interface but in its extensibility and realtively known interfaces. It existed for so long and API was stable with free development tools available so there are literally tons of applications available including iPhone like interfaces (and HTC one is not the only and even remotely the best one available). Now for all relative newcomers including iPhone and overhyped Android this is a really tough to beat feature and it will be some time while the same diversity of choice will be available as easily on other mobile devices. Tell me for example how many GPS navigation apps do you know that will support Android (or ebven iPhone) out of the well known GPS software manufacturers? My guess would be probably none (at least initially).\r\n\r\nThen it is also about the choice, how many choices do you have to customise your iPhone applications and interface (let say choose a different mp3 or video player or change interface to be something different if you don't like theirs)? Or even extend iPhone with an SD card? It has its niche (gadget lovers and youngsters) as will Android but versatility of multiple use as a smart device of a long way ahead in my view from the WM and Symbian devices. \r\n\r\nAlso the largest consumer of the smart phone devices at the moment are business people, financial centers workers developers who generally need one device does it all (or at least tries to do it all) and in this area it's hard to see any viable alternative so far. I do work in the city (UK, London) and majority of the people that walk by, my colleagues have WM or Symbian based phones.\r\n\r\nAgain I'm not saying that it's not going to happen and Android won't take off but it will take time and simply dismissing WM and saying it's rubbish because it is is a great underestimation"
