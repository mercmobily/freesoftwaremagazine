    body: "> given that 95% of computers are using some version of Windows\r\n\r\nGary, if you're going to use statements like that one, you could at least qualify it with the word \"desktop\". Otherwise it becomes sound-bite not much better than the FUD you're speaking out about.\r\n\r\nAlso while I was as bemused as you about this. It is as you say very much a non-story. Microsoft can't even guarantee the standard of users of their software so how could they expect anybody else to guarantee a standard of internet users.\r\n\r\nNice rant though :)\r\n\r\n--\r\nEquitas IT Solutions - fairness, quality, freedom\r\nhttp://www.equitasit.co.uk"
