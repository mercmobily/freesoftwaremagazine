    body: "Well done Brian.\r\nYou had done a wonderfull job. \r\nUbuntu Hacks indeed is a very good book who want to go quickly to the solutions. \r\nI have read the book and am keeping it always beside me both at work and home. \r\nA simple linux user like me almost got a reputation of a geek you know?\r\n\r\nIn fact I changed my linux distribution to  Ubuntu after reading the book. \r\nCongratulations to the authors and Orielly Books."
