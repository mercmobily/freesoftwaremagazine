The only ones who will regret it are Microsoft and their army of MCSE's that want to suck money out of that country over to Redmond.\r\n\r\nI hope to see a mass of South African teachers, tech administrators, etc. on the K12LTSP mailing list!\r\n\r\nspitz@cmosnetworks.com"

    body: "to South Africa's IT industry. Free software is all about allowing the user to empower themselves as well as encouraging the free flow of information.\r\n\r\nSince a Free Software solution is unlikely to be completely adequate for the people's requirements, the government would have to hire the services of a solution provider, and the government would most likely hire the services of local companies thus, money would stay within the country as opposed to relying on foreign companies to provide solutions. Local businesses are most likely to understand the government's requirements and are probably more suited to solving problems that are unique to their own government. \r\n\r\nIT companies are free to learn from and contribute towards the existing pool of freely available knowledge. This can lead to an improvement to a company's reputation, experience and expertise; just by drawing upon available knowledge and releasing the resulting solution to their users. People will also need to be trained to be able to provide these solutions and so, the local education industry would also need to be able to provide for this.\r\n\r\nAll this finally leads to a stronger overall economy as the result of allowing users to empower themselves as well as allowing information to be shared."
