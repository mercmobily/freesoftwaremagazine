And, as we let go of from where we came, we wonder how solid the ground is beneath us as we move forward. It sounds so good - but, can we make a living, too? What a journey. I am so glad to be involved. Thanks, Scott for this great read! '

Real estate property lines are just a series of vectors, which are also numbers. All of your bank balances are just numbers. A lot of things we own are really just information.\r\n\r\nOwnership and numbers are both abstract concepts.\r\n\r\nAs such, the rules are subject to change, but I don't think it makes sense to reject the whole concept."

    body: "Well, it may have been kind of a flip comment, but I'd still make the distinction between public and private numbers.  If someone publishes with the intention of something being read/used, then it falls more in to the public number thing.\r\n\r\nAnd the property lines may be vectors, but the property is \"real.\"\r\n\r\nNow, I know that I give my account numbers to people with the intention of them being used, but I hope we can make that distinction between that and other forms of speech.  :-)"

    body: "Thanks, Amy.  Yes, the making a living thing is what we have to worry about today.  It's fun to imagine a Star Trek future where people don't have to work and can choose any kind of interesting work/hobby they really would like to do.\r\n\r\nI believe to a degree the idea that anyone can do today what they want to do, but it also seems disingenuous, given differences in opportunities, skills, and intelligence.\r\n\r\nBut technology is improving ever faster, and while it creates new problems, it appears to solve many others.  It's conceivable that in the future we will reach some kind of post-scarcity society, and only after getting much closer to it will more people see that weird things like free software were essential steps in that direction.  And while the transition may be rocky, it will ultimately be a good thing.  (And now that I have a daughter, I'm more concerned about the long term. :-)\r\n\r\nJust like I'd guess the first agriculture pioneers might have appeared to be doing some weird things as opposed to the long-established hunting and gathering system, we're doing something similarly fundamental in human history as the invention of agriculture.  (Now wouldn't *that* invention be a good one to establish perpetual ownership of for you and your descendants?  Of course, maybe we're getting back to that with things like <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monsanto_Canada_Inc._v._Schmeiser\">Monsanto's biotech patents</a>.)\r\n\r\n----\r\n<a href=\"http://www.movingtofreedom.org/\" title=\"Freedom is on the March!\">http://www.movingtofreedom.org/</a>"

Find what you love and pursue it! You don't have to force yourself to find time to do what you love to do and, as a result, you *are* going to get good at it and should be able to make a reasonable living for your family. So, I think your idea is probably not as \"Star Trekian\" as you might think. \r\n\r\nI believe you are right about our transition period; it is difficult to see where we are heading and how everyone's needs will be taken care of. I worry about volunteers being ultimately taken advantage of if greed and collusion are allowed to take control. That is where community is going to be an important watch dog. \r\n\r\nYou have a good mind, Scott, and I enjoy and learn from your perspectives. Thanks much!"
