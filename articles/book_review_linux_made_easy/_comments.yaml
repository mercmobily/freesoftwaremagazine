    body: "I installed Xandros on my old Compac computer, without any previous knowlege of Linux whatever. I am not a \r\ntrained computer professional --- no programmer, repair tech, IT administrator. Xan saw all my hardware,\r\nconfigured it without a hitch, and less than half an hour after I popped the cd in the drive, I was cruising\r\nthe internet. I gave a presentation on this for a class I was taking and no one believed me! If I hear the\r\n\"Linux is not ready for prime time\" cliche one more time, I think I may have convulsions. Linux is evolving so\r\nfast that almost anything we say about it today, will be wrong by next week."
