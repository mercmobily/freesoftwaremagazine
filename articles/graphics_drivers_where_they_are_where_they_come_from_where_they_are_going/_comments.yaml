    body: "Hi, I wouldn't recommend using the term \"Intellectual Property\" which you used in the section headed 'Intel'. It's a deliberately misleading and biased term used by developers and supporters of proprietary software. There's a good article by Richard Stallman about why not to use it <a href=\"http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/not-ipr.xhtml\">here</a>.\r\n\r\n--\r\nGNU - free as in freedom"

    body: "...and I thought capitalizing it would make it show up as the dreaded 'Intellectual Property' monster RMS describes it as: an invalid concept used by some to sell stuff that doesn't exist and restrain people's liberties.\r\nYou may have noticed that I haven't used it with any other hardware makers, and actually concentrated on reverse engineering. I had to mention it to show that, even by playing Devil's advocate, Intellectual Property doesn't stand.\r\nNext time I'll put a bigger emphasis on this kind of sarcasm, though.\r\n---\r\nA computer is like air conditioning: it becomes useless when you open windows."
