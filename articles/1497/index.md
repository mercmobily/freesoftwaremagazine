Ah, MIT. I don’t know what it takes to get into this school, but, damn, they have some good people there. I learned about their [Open Course Ware](http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2006/ocw.html) project a few years ago, and am so glad to see it’s still thriving. The concept is simple: Make all the course materials freely available online, so that even folks like me (who are denied the chance to go to MIT), still get to reap some of the benefits of an MIT education. I’m timidly suggesting to my own dept that we start thinking in this direction. Sure, there’s an altruistic ideal behind it, but also one of power: This is a surefire way for a U to win influence.
