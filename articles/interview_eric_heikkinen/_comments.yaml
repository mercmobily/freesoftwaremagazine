    body: "Your worst case scenario is a little off. Since Pligg's template and therefore the CSS code in question was released before SuperGU existed (this could be easily proved), it is thereforeo also easy to prove that SuperGU doesn't have copyright on it because, here's the key point, Pligg's code is copyrighted as soon as it's created. You do not have to apply for copyright, it anything you create is automatically copyrighted the moment you create it. As long as you can prove it was created first, then they have no case. As for copyrighting layout elements, again since Pligg existed first, he has no case.\r\n\r\nYour worst case scenario may include having to drop out of school to fight this frivolous lawsuit. But it would get dismissed very quickly, and there's plenty of case law to back that up."
