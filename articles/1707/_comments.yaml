Honestly, though I did not mean to use the proposition \"free software is communist\" as merely a strawman -- I actually believe that the term is at least as applicable as \"capitalist\" is (and actually more so).\r\n\r\nWe really have four concepts: \"capitalism\", \"free market\", \"communism\", and \"command economy\". In the industrial-era matter economy we could safely assume that \"free market capitalism\" would be aligned opposite to \"command economy communism\". So much so that we have conflated these four concepts into two.\r\n\r\nBut the information economy turns that on its head.  Now we have to choose between \"command economy capitalism\" and \"free market communism\".\r\n\r\nSo if you were a \"free market capitalist\", which bit was it that you liked?  The freedom, or the necessity of building capital in order to create wealth? Personally, I'm going for the freedom -- and if that means that the natural approach to information production is communist, then so be it.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that I've already said all this, so if people didn't get it the first time, this comment probably won't help, but I can't help trying again!\r\n"

    body: "The problem I have with being called a \"communist\" is not unlike the problem with being called a \"liberal\". Since when is it an insult? And so why should we run scared from it?\r\n\r\nYou have to have bought into a particular and very elaborate \"frame\" in order to accept the idea that \"communism\" is automatically evil. The other side isn't just throwing insulting words around, they're attempting to redefine them in the process by lumping a whole complex system of assumptions onto them.\r\n\r\nIt's true that the communism as implemented in the 20th century largely derives from Karl Marx, and might be more properly and narrowly defined as \"Marxism\" which is particularly violent and oppressive (one could mention Lenin and Stalin, but they're hardly an improvement), but American labor unions have also identified themselves and been identified by others as \"communist\". Certainly they believe in the power of collective action. And I for one, owe a personal debt of gratitude to American labor unions. Collective bargaining for fair wages is the reason I have a college education.\r\n\r\nI know that in a pure capitalist system, the tradesmen in my ancestry would've been ground into the dirt by the same kind of greedy capitalist scum that's trying to control this ideology. I've seen what they do first hand, and I've read enough history to know exactly what the \"captains of industry\" will do to the working class if they can make one extra stinking buck by doing it.\r\n\r\nI'll fight for \"freedom\" versus \"oppression\", but \"capitalism\" versus \"communism\"?   Who cares?  Freedom can be ideological, but fighting for the economy to be controlled by a few people with deep pockets versus the collective decisionmaking of the many? That's way too much like the \"divine right of kings\" for my taste. Prove to me why it should matter to me.\r\n\r\nIMHO, the only reason why it matters is because -- in the matter economy -- capitalism is what happens when there are no market controls. It is in that sense \"natural\". Communist states in the 20th century showed us just how expensive and difficult it is to manage an economy unnaturally, and I strongly support the free market, which means that as regards the matter economy, I'm a capitalist, albeit not exactly a \"laissez faire\" capitalist, because I believe that capitalist markets need boundary conditions in order to behave reasonably well.\r\n\r\nBut come the information economy and the tables are turned -- now communism is what happens naturally in a free market, and the capitalists need extensive market controls to keep themselves in business. Or so believes Microsoft, the RIAA, and the MPAA. They say we have to have extensive \"private intellectual property\" systems, artificially enforced by state authority via more and more restrictive laws. And then the laws about that private property aren't enough (and consumers don't believe they're fair), so they start trying to make new technology to enforce their will violently, by oppressing the consumer. Then they feel they need a new set of laws (like the DMCA) to protect the technology of oppression -- even from the prying eyes of researchers. Essentially, they are asking for secret state police measures to enforce their will.\r\n\r\nSo, I think we need to stop fearing the idea that what we're doing might be communist. Our experience has mislead us into believing that it is the communists who want to oppress us, and that capitalism is always the way to freedom. But that doesn't work in the information world. Information is best when it is widely shared and held in common -- even the American \"Founding Fathers\" believed that. It's only the peculiar idea of trying to apply rules from the matter marketplace onto information that would make us think otherwise.\r\n\r\nThe problem with the label \"libertarian\", though it is probably just as descriptive, is that -- as a party -- libertarians have come down on the other side of the intellectual property issue. Unfortunately, they've been so snowed by the capitalist propaganda, that they don't realize that IP is unfree.\r\n\r\nStill, maybe an argument from the \"libertarian\" angle is worth writing. The main reason I didn't do that here is that I think it's already been done rather well.\r\n"

You could say photosintesis is imaginative\r\nbecause nobody would have thought of it if we hadn't had plants to show us. But that's silly, not only because we wouldn't\r\nbe here, much less think of photosintesis, if there were no plants, but because \"imaginative\" applies to ideas, attitudes and\r\nhuman behaviour, not to biochemical reactions. You could say that photosintesis is conventional because it happens all over\r\nthe planet and is the basis of all conventional life in the planet. But it is not \"conventional\". It is natural but nobody\r\nhas decided to use photosintesis to turn sun radiation to life as an option between some other equally valid option that we could\r\nhave choosen. It is no convention because nobody planned it, so it is not conventional. \r\n\r\nCommunism and capitalism is about allocating resources. Communism says they should be allocated evenly among everybody, \r\nand capitalism that people who are somehow more productive should get more resources. Communism believes that it is \r\nwasteful for someone to have more than he needs while someone has less than necessary and capitalism thinks that it\r\nis wasteful to allocate the same resources to those who produce more than those who produce less. This only makes \r\nsense when resources are allocatable. Once you deal with resources that everybody can have as much as he wants without\r\nstopping anybody else from having the same (like information) the allocation is irrelevant, is meaningless and is \r\nartificial.\r\n\r\nThat's theory. In practice we haven't tried communism and we haven't tried free markets. We've tried state controled \r\nproduction and oligopolists controlled markets . Somehow the communists argue that private control of means of production\r\nleads to the benefit of only the few that control means of production and neglect of desirable outcomes from which no\r\nsingle party benefits, while capitalists argue that central control\r\nof production leads to both a control problem too large to solve (therefore bureaucracy and inefficiencies) and \r\nto the benefit of those controlling it (the political class). But that is again about finite resources. Should \r\nfactories produce Cola or books ? A factory can only produce one of the two. You can have only so many factories,\r\nyou can't have two facilities in the same place at the same time... But should a desktop be programmed in C or C++ ? \r\nWell, you can have 2 different desktops . monolithic kernel or microkernel ? You can have a wide choice of kernels...\r\nEven if you are sure of what is the right decision you don't lose anything by someone taking different decisions.\r\nIf I am sure that kids need to read books more than drink cola, so we should prioritise paper and book factories \r\nover cola factories, and someone else disagrees then we have a problem because there is only so much land to build \r\nthe factories, only so much water to use for cola or for manufacturing paper... So we can start arguing whether \r\nit should be decided by the government or the venture capital.\r\n\r\nThe only finite resource in knowledge economy is time, and even that it is only finite from a certain perspective. \r\nYour own time is finite, but if you happen to have children maybe the time available for any task is not finite\r\n(at least until you take into account that we don't seem to be getting round to making our species survive\r\nan infinite time). \r\n\r\nIf free software was communism then the free software revolution should be about confiscating excess software from those who\r\nhave more software than they need and giving it to those who don't have enough software. Free software is not that, at most is \r\nabout giving software to those who need it (and about much more) but there's no need to take it from anyone else. \r\nIf free software was capitalism then it wouldn't make sense that everybody could get tens of thousands of packages\r\nin a distribution, irrespective of their contribution to free software, the amount of free software available \r\nto each person should be related somehow to what that person \"deserves\" by some notion of \"deserving\". Both absurdities remind more of propietary software than of free software, because both are modeled on scarcity of resources which is\r\ncontrary to the nature of information and therefore to the nature of software. \r\n\r\nDo you think Marx woud have objected to his books being included in the large libraries of people who already had \r\nmany books (think of e-books so that the scarcity of paper or printing press does not play a role)? Do you think \r\nKeynes would have a problem if told that every person in the would would be able to read his theory irrespective\r\nof how much money he had, how much work he had done and how much he had contributed to economic theory ?. Was Marx\r\nagainst private libraries ? Was Keynes against public libraries ? (would they have been if they had known \r\nof electronic storage of their works?).  Did Stalin pretend that all information should be owned by the state ? \r\n(i.e. was he against confidentiality or secrets?). Did McCarthy outlaw language, math or any other knowledge \r\nshared by everyone ?. Both capitalism and communism is about matter economy. Information is only addressed \r\nas an asset for control, not as a good.\r\n\r\nThe article points rightly many incoherencies of trying to apply mater economy to intangibles, but it does not realise that communism is just a different matter economy model, not more adapted to knowledge economy than capitalism.\r\n\r\nSo free software is not about capitalism, not about communism: it is about information and about choice, about software and about freedom.\r\n"

There is NO OTHER WAY to Insure the Viability, Integrity and Future of Freedom and Democracy.\r\n\r\nCommunists only know how to Steal. It has been 8 years since Bill Gates and Company were Convicted of Abusing their Monopoly Power and they still, to this very day, have not complied with ANY of the Remedies set forth by the Honorable Thomas Penfield Jackson or his Successors on Appeal. Bill Gates and Company simply CAN NOT comply with the Remedies because they have no idea whatsoever how a Free and Democratic Society works. It is Anathema to their Ideology.\r\n\r\nI say to you all and for all to hear, that Bill Gates verily is the greatest Communist and Criminal Mastermind of the 20th and 21st Centuries. He has been Our Most Deadly Foe for over 30 years, and he continues to be Our Worst Enemy. We, the Free and Democratic People of the World, are still Fighting against him and we shall continue to Fight against him, against those Billionaire fellows of his Communist ilk and against those who would sympathize, support and make excuses for the Bad Behavior of Their Communist Dictators who continue to act against the wishes of a Free and Democratic Society.

We should keep in mind that Victory is not Inevitable but, by Each of Us doing Our Part to dispel Confusion, Lies and Ignorance, it most surely is a Distinct Probability that FREEDOM WILL PREVAIL.\r\n\r\nUntil that day dawns, We will continue to face a struggle NO LESS IMPORTANT to the Future of the Free People of the World than the American People have faced, and continue to face, in their struggles from 1776 onwards.\r\n\r\nSigned,\r\n\r\nJohn Quincy Public, Citizen of the World.\r\n"

Our mother taught us that we can be anything we want to be if we:\r\n1. Learn to speak properly.\r\n2. Get all the education we can.\r\n3. DON'T GET ANYONE PREGNANT!\r\n\r\nShe refused to accept food stamps because she could afford food, just not housing, and she wanted us to know that we were not supposed to take handouts just because they were there.\r\n\r\nSo, I guess in a way you are right, success is dependent on being privileged enough to have a good education.  Just not the bourgeois education you suggest.  The education of success is what my mother gave me.  The education you give is that of failure.  You and those like you are guilty of telling people in tough situations that they cannot succeed on their own.  Your message is the root of the social problem.\r\n\r\nDoes the public education system in the US suck?  Yes.  But there is still no excuse for not learning.

My brother had the discipline to get good grades and he went into radiology and with grants and scholarships paid less than half of full price for his schooling.

    body: "I'm sorry if the term \"bourgeois\" offended you. Clearly you felt I was labeling you. But pithy banter aside, the term was accurate in the way I used it, which was to modify the word \"education\", and that is exactly what I meant: \"an education defined by the values and needs of the bourgeoisie\". \r\n\r\nThe definition of \"bourgeois\" (from Wordnet, the GCIDE definitions are similar) is:\r\n\r\n* \"belonging to the middle class\" or\r\n* \"a capitalist who engages in industrial commercial enterprise\"\r\n\r\nIn other words, someone who owns the capital for their own production, such as a small (or medium-sized) business owner.\r\n\r\nRegardless of _your_ economic class, if you got your education in a US public school, or indeed, in almost any US private school, then the curriculum was almost certainly determined by members of the bourgeoisie, either directly, or through indirect influences such as a school board position. I have seen very few exceptions to this rule.\r\n\r\nMind you, this is equally true of the education _I_ received, at least through high school level.\r\n\r\nBy and large, this is not a problem, but there are conflicts of interest that can create confusion.\r\n\r\nI assert that it is one such confusion that you are clinging to in your prior anonymous post -- the conflation between the separate terms \"capitalist\" and \"free market\". Since the free market is probably the best ideological argument for the benefit of capitalism, is it any surprise that capitalists themselves want to believe that the two are inseparable?\r\n\r\nThus, conventional education in the US treats these terms as interchangeable, because it is assumed they always go hand-in-hand. This is not a conspiracy. It's a blind spot. I'm sure the people writing those textbooks _think_ they are telling the truth when they imply that \"capitalism\" and the \"free market\" are the same thing.\r\n\r\nHowever, the _main point_ of this article is precisely that, in the domain of information production, they are _not_ the same!\r\n\r\nInstead we face a choice between \"free market communism\" and \"command economy capitalism\" (choices we didn't have in the matter marketplace). As someone who strongly favors the \"free market\" (the lack of market controls) but is ambivalent about \"capitalism\" (the accumulation of wealth to fund businesses), I favor the former choice -- it's more important to be free than to allow people to get rich (not that I believe it's bad to get rich, it just isn't as important to society as freedom is). If that means being a \"communist\" (one who believes in collective action to start projects), then I'm cool with that.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, this is limited to the information marketplace. Since I favor the free market, I also favor \"free market capitalism\" where it occurs -- which is in the matter marketplace.\r\n\r\nBut of course, this is somewhat tongue-in-cheek, because the whole point is that the old rules and assumptions break down in the information marketplace. I'm sure you realize that neither Adam Smith nor Karl Marx had any clue what 21st century information economies were going to look like. They both dealt with the matter economics of the agrarian and industrial ages. Thus, their theories both break down when the fundamental assumptions they are based on -- such as the conservation of number -- are broken.\r\n\r\nIt's a bit off-topic, but since you bring it up, I do not advocate \"government handouts\" any more or less than your mother did. I've made similar choices myself, and for much the same reasons.\r\n"
