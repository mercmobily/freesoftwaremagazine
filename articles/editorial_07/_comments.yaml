I think this is something that X.org should try to solve, but distros should at least provide temporary workarounds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n- problems with alsa. Alsa replaces OSS giving a lot of features that very few need;\r\n\r\nfor some chips it requires understanding yet another configuration file: the far from easy /etc/asound.conf . \r\n\r\nThe alsa utils should include at least a ncurses interface to asound.conf modification. Better docs for USERS are required. The available docs (wikis, FAQs, alsa guides) seem to be more developer-oriented than user-oriented. The wiki is a very bad way to document stuff, because it's too dispersive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n- problems with printing. Most of these depend on GDI only printers. I guess printer manufactures are to blame here in many cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr/>\r\n\r\n<strong>From</strong>: Mike \r\n<strong>Url</strong>: \r\n<strong>Date</strong>: 2005-09-21\r\n<strong>Subject:</strong> Linux passion\r\n\r\n\r\nYes, there is some things that may not work out of the box, but I think most of manufacturers make things dificult not sharing any specifications even for open source driver developers :(\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThey would develop linux drivers by themselfs if linux had more market share, but that's going to the same problem...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart of this problem is Corporations only think in profit and don't see the harmony there could be in the world if they dedicate a litle bit of time for some projects and at least make their products multi-platform compatible.\r\n\r\nBecause they would be helping the very same people that help each other on this good and healthy chain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnyway If you think of the zero point where no hardware at all was suported at the opensource world, there is a prety good list of suported hardware made (mainly) by this comunity, this proves the chain it's working, and once a person understands what's involved in the process and how it (does) work, will never look back ;)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI really start to learn Linux the day I instaled Slackware and dumped windows out of my harddrive ;)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr/>\r\n\r\n<strong>From</strong>: Maurizio \r\n<strong>Url</strong>: www.ome.ch\r\n<strong>Date</strong>: 2005-09-21\r\n<strong>Subject:</strong> Why ?\r\n\r\n\r\nYou really where very patient and your questions are more then justified. Why is it still so difficult to install a real Linux-Desktop. After 7 Years I know the scene and have following answer: \r\n\r\nThe Linux developpers have nearly no empathy to a normal user, they mean they have to learn and learn and learn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr/>\r\n\r\n<strong>From</strong>: AdamW \r\n<strong>Url</strong>: http://www.happyassassin.net\r\n<strong>Date</strong>: 2005-09-21\r\n<strong>Subject:</strong> Maybe you should try some other distros?\r\n\r\n\r\nMaybe you should ignore the GUHW (Gigantic Ubuntu Hype Wave) and try other distros? I'm obviously utterly biased (I work for Mandriva), but I know the back / forward buttons on my Logitech mouse worked as soon as I plugged it in to my Mandriva 2006 machine. Don't know how, don't care, but they work. Sound works straight away on Audigy 2 cards on our distro, too (unless you have digital speakers, when you have to flip a mixer control from analog to digital; we've got to pick a default, and analog it is). Frankly I'm surprised Ubuntu would need any patches to make this work, since it's about the most common sound card in the world and has been supported by ALSA for years - what did they manage to break? The Stylus CX6500 is right on our printer configuration tool's list of supported models, as well (though I don't have one here so I can't vouch for how perfectly it's supported, but it really should be fine if it's in the list). Maybe you should grab copies of Mandriva 2006 (release due real soon), SUSE 10 (same), and maybe the latest releases of Mepis, Linspire and Xandros and see whether Ubuntu really is all that...\r\n\r\n<hr/>\r\n\r\n<strong>From</strong>: Henrique Marks \r\n<strong>Url</strong>: \r\n<strong>Date</strong>: 2005-09-22\r\n<strong>Subject:</strong> totally agreed\r\n\r\n\r\nI was going to say exactly the same. Forget Ubuntu. Never saw so much propaganda for so few. I have tried many distributions for the last months, because \"my\" distro, conectiva, was \"abducted\" by mandrake, now mandriva. And mandriva 10.? wasnt that nice. I just can say that openSuse RC1 and Mandriva (the new one) are just great. Debian is great too, but you have to work out the problems (as you saw with Ubuntu).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd Ubuntu has that Desktop problem, it is just gnome. Try Kubuntu, with KDE, or wait for Ubuntu with GNOME and KDE, so you can have the best of two worlds. Well, maybe i am just dreaming...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChange distro, and write another good story, showing that we are there, already :-)\r\n\r\n<hr/>\r\n\r\n<strong>From</strong>: Nick Prescott \r\n<strong>Url</strong>: \r\n<strong>Date</strong>: 2005-09-22\r\n<strong>Subject:</strong> O/S Linux\r\n\r\n\r\nYou should have tried Xandros  3\r\n\r\nits so much easier and most things work straight out of the \"box\"\r\n\r\n<hr/>\r\n\r\n<strong>From</strong>: nick \r\n<strong>Url</strong>: \r\n<strong>Date</strong>: 2005-09-22\r\n<strong>Subject:</strong> Linux newbie\r\n\r\n\r\nYour friends should have told you about Xandros 3,it just works for almost everything,not much hacking needed !\r\n\r\n<hr/>\r\n\r\n<strong>From</strong>: shahnawaz  \r\n<strong>Url</strong>: http://www.hostholic.com\r\n<strong>Date</strong>: 2005-09-22\r\n<strong>Subject:</strong> Linux on the desktop: are we nearly there yet? '\r\n\r\n\r\nUbuntu is great.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI am yet to come around an organization which has contributed to linux the way Ubuntu has done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI guess your problem was not with Linux per se (lot of hardware drivers are made for Windows, if organization had made the drivers for Linux then I really dont know where Windows would be)  but the distribution. I personally love Ubuntu but for usability sake and exploiting the maximum of Gnome and KDE, I use SUSE 9.3.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLuckily for me the day I was introduced to Linux it was thru SUSE 9.1. I did try other distro's but I am really comfy with SUSE the way they pack most of the open source softwares and drivers in their distro is just amazing. they give support to majority of the hardwares.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI would recommend trying out SUSE 9.3 (and what more they now have patch for MP3 too) its just neat and makes desktop life a breeze.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBTW, WINE, MONO and Crossover office are going to make life much easier for Windows program users.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo I must say that the time is near when majority of users will be Linux users.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShahnawaz\r\n\r\n<hr/>\r\n\r\n<strong>From</strong>: Scott \r\n<strong>Url</strong>: \r\n<strong>Date</strong>: 2005-10-10\r\n<strong>Subject:</strong> Must use the command-line to edit configuration files?\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat stopped you from running a graphical editor as root? Finding, viewing, and editing configuration files can all be done graphically.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMany distributions provide custom graphical interfaces to key system configuration files as well. YaST on SUSE comes to mind. These make understanding the syntax of those files unnecessary, but even without them, dropping to the command-line to edit them is completely unnecessary on any distribution with a graphical interface.\r\n\r\n<hr/>\r\n\r\n<strong>From</strong>: Dave Guard \r\n<strong>Url</strong>: www.freesoftwaremagazine.com\r\n<strong>Date</strong>: 2005-10-11\r\n<strong>Subject:</strong> That's not what the problem was\r\n\r\n\r\nHi,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou have a point but it doesn't stop me from having to edit files.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMy point is that these things should all be automatic. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSome of the problem comes from hardware vendors, some from the software. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAn operating system should (in my opinion) come fully assembled and should automatically detect and handle my hardware for me. I should be able to sit down and drive it without having to tinker under the hood. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOf course, much of the beauty of FS would be lost if we weren't able to look under the hood. I am saying we should be able to, but shouldn't have to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was suggested to me that Ubuntu would be the simplest to install. It was very easy. Apparently I had some problems that wouldn't have occurred in other distros. I feel that I would still have encountered problems (perhaps not the same ones) with other distros.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFS needs to become more friendly to the \"newbie\". It still has a way to go.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\n<hr/>\r\n\r\n<strong>From</strong>: Postman \r\n<strong>Url</strong>: \r\n<strong>Date</strong>: 2005-10-25\r\n<strong>Subject:</strong> Web design shortcomings\r\n\r\n\r\nI have been using Suse Linux for over 6 months and have found an equivalent for most things except Dreamweaver, Photoshop (GIMP is not the same)/Paint Shop Pro and Flash.\r\n\r\nI will keep having to go back to Windoze for web design until these apps are compiled for Linux.\r\n\r\nI have even tried Win4Lin and Crossover Office and these are not good enough, we need the big software companies to cater for all of us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr/>\r\n\r\n<strong>From</strong>: Hooplife \r\n<strong>Url</strong>: \r\n<strong>Date</strong>: 2005-10-31\r\n<strong>Subject:</strong> Ubuntu Forums\r\n\r\n\r\nHi,\r\n\r\nI have been using Ubuntu for several months after trying several other distros. Yes there are things that don't work right out of the box but I believe you would have found the answers to your problems much faster if you would have checked the Ubuntu forums instead of searching Google. I had the same problem with my mouse among a few other minor problems and found help right away in the forums. The Ubuntu forums are by far the best and friendliest forums I have used.\r\n\r\n<hr/>\r\n\r\n"
