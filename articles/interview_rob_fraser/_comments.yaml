    body: "Ahmed Kamal:\r\nVPN is a tunneling solution, backed by different security protocols (such as IPSec). But OpenVPN can provide a \"SSH-based VPN solution\", as providing SSH services through VPN connection.\r\n\r\n\r\nBusiness world doesn't just know yet how to address \"Open\"/Free software. It will take a few years, and we will see that new managers (who are being educated now <em> with </em> such software) will understand fully what is it all about and then such penetration will take much more \"usual\" road - it will be as acceptable as any other software."
