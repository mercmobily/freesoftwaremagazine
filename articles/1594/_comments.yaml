    body: "<cite>Ryan Cartwright was quick to comment that Lenovo have since denied that any such announcement was made.</cite> \r\n\r\nHi Martin,\r\n\r\nNobody denied the <i>announcement</i> was made. I said they denied it was ever their intention to drop support - a claim which seems substantiated by this post.\r\n\r\nI have to admit that it does make more sense for them to have never intended to drop Linux support. Apart from the Chinese government contract you mention, Linux support is apparently a good selling point for them.\r\n\r\nRyan"
