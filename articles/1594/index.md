On Monday, I [commented on reports of Lenovo dropping support for Linux](http://www.freesoftwaremagazine.com/node/1585).

Ryan Cartwright was quick to comment that Lenovo have since denied that any such announcement was made. Others around the blogosphere have commented that the retraction could be due to the negative response received by Lenovo when the original story broke, but honestly, I should have seen it for the fake that it was.

Why? Well on Tuesday I posted [this piece](http://feeds.computerworld.com/Computerworld/MartinMCBrown?m=168) to my Computerworld blog. Here, I'd commented on the fact that the Chinese Government has requested that any approved hardware must support Linux, and one of the companies that have already been approved are Lenovo.

I hardly think that Lenovo will drop Linux just as they become an approved supplier for the Chinese government...
