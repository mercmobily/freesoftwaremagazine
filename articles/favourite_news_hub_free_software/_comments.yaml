    body: "I did say \"exclusively free software\". LXer by it's own strap line is about \r\n\"GNU/Linux and Free/Open Source Software\".\r\n\r\nOkay so it is about Linux but I was referring to the fact that FSDaily is the only one that is (supposed to be) about free software alone. Not open source and not just GNU/Linux (but of course it features heavily.\r\n\r\nI like LXer (really) but my point was that the poll is a little loaded."
