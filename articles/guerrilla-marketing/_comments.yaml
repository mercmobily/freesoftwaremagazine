    body: "Hello, I am a student at Penn State University and had a few questions about guerilla marketing. A group of students and I are taking place in an adverting promotion and wanted to incorporate guerilla marketing.  We are unable to find a few awnsers about this type of marketing and were wondering if you can help at all. Some questions include:\r\nHow much on average does it cost to use guerilla advertising?\r\nHow much does it cost to use guerill advertising in large markets like New York City?\r\nWhat are the most popular types of guerilla advertising methods?\r\nThank you\r\nScott Duffy"
