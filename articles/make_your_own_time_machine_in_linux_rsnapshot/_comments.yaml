    body: "Hi!\r\n\r\nGreat tutorial, but I have one problem. When I run the datestamp_backups.py, I get:\r\n\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"/usr/local/sbin/datestamp_backups_wd.py\", line 34, in <module>\r\n    os.remove(os.path.join(RSNAP_ROOT, 'daily.0', 'DATE'))\r\nOSError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/media/WD/Backup/daily.0/DATE'\r\n\r\nI've changed RSNAP_ROOT, that is alright, but because it is the first time I run datestamp_backups.py, I really don't have the DATE directory under my daily.0 dir, there is just localhost.\r\n\r\nWhat should I do?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance."
