    body: "I own this book, but have not delved into it yet.  That will be for later.\r\n\r\nTo get started, I recommend <A href=\"http://dougs-book-review.com/software-development/mysql-crash-course\">MySQL Crash Course</A>.  It covers the basics and doesn't make the subject seem harder than it really is.  Once you have the basics and are comfortable with the syntax, I think a more advance book like this one is a good idea.\r\n\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.Discover-Doug.com\">Partly Technical</a>"
