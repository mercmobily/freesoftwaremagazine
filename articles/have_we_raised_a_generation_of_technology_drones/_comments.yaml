My god, what has happened to society that no application can ever be better than Microsoft's in the eye of the public? Nevermind the fact that this opinion comes from people who have no specific reason to hate one package or another out of fanboyism, and who aren't just saying things because they're too lazy to perform the rollout. These are remarks coming from people who installed OOo, worked with it, and felt, at least somewhere, uncomfortable working with it.\r\n\r\nI, as a longtime computer user, software developer and allround technology lover, can't say I disagree with them, and alot of my friends wouldn't either. Honestly, the fact that they're actually telling you they might need manuals (and thus taking upon them the added task of reading and understanding those) might be a hint at the fact that OOo's UI isn't quite as intuitive or inviting as MS Office's. Sure, it might also mean they're just really, really used to using MS Office, but I can't remember the last time I set up MS Office for anyone and had them ask me for manuals afterwards.\r\n\r\nThere's something really authistic about the idea that, because they have a specific opinion you do not agree with, you start wondering what has happened to the world that such a thing is possible."

(IMO, this is partly how we got to where we are now.)\r\nAlso, while the Open Source movement is making headways, i would argue that they are only duplicating the problem, i.e. Open Office is an attempt to dupllicate MS Office.

(e.g., why not try and Open Source a version of Wordperfect?)\r\nFor my own use, i still use Xywrite, under DOS, under virtual PC on my six year old Mac Powerbook.

Everything we do is focused on the MS mentality and I'm convinced that all we have done is teach our students how to use MS Office products instead of teaching them the reasoning behind WHY you create documents with headers/footers, etc.  \r\n\r\nIn my 5 years here as a student and an instructor I've come to the conclusion that the only program out of the whole course we really need to teach is windows.  Like it or not, we live in a windows world and it's important that new computer users understand the primary computer interface.  But Office Software?  That's a dime a dozen.  As Brant said, Office is not nessissary for most of what we teach.  Instead of forcing students to use Office (and either pay the cost for the program or the time to use our lab) we should teach them on OO, which is freely avalible and they can convert if need be.  Getting text manuals is not a difficult thing. \r\n\r\nNow, with all that said, OO is a different product the MS Office.  As an experiment, I tried to complete our class using Linux and OO.  For the most part, all the basics were the same (with the exception of Linux of course).  It was the more advanced features, such as Headers/Footers where I began having difficulties.  OO and MS Office may look the same, but in higher level functions they are as different as vinager and water.  It took me over a month to figure out how to do basic things I knew by heart with Office.  But once I relearned them I had no problems.\r\n\r\nI don't understand why educational facilities are so dead set against Open Source Solutions.  If your teaching a basic Office course where it is assumed that the student has no prior exepriance or training in Office Products...then why not Open Office?  It's better for the school financially and it's better for the student educationally.  I can't tell you how many students would love to have a copy of Office to use at home instead of spending hours per week at our lab.  But as long as we continue to use Office they will have to pay in time or cash for the 'education' they are getting.\r\n\r\nAnd it's not much...most of our students are computer drones....able to repeat what we ask them to do but not have a clue why they are doing it."

Such are the bounds of institutionalized corporate/government reach, funding, licensing and subsidies that schools must face with diligence at a constant level.\r\n\r\nThe nature of teaching in schools has never been to mandate 'new ways of thinking,' there is never a climate of creative involvement in many processes, nor is this instilled into student learning behavior. You are pretty much benchmarked by your output, and not your journey through creative means that go against the status quo [i.e. using 'lesser' means to reach the same expected output].\r\n\r\nAn easier path to learning or to defy what is the norm is a hard cocoon to crack when policies and protocols become standard rigor. As far as I'm aware students have a right to choose, teachers impart their wisdom as to how conclusive results would be best 'managed, marked and scored,' and not how they would be ascertained through 'creative' approaches to dismantling or changing the status quo. This I can confidently say transposes onto replacing or transitioning any process whether it be the hardware that is used or the software. This however transcends a lot of other issues within the educational system as well.\r\n\r\nErgo, we have a common issue where the path to least resistance will inevitably be always taken and not in most cases by choice, but by political and cultural directions authorized by societal acceptance/expectancy/stigma.\r\n\r\nThe undertone to this whole article is basically showing you why <strong>choice</strong> within schooling, <strong>is and will always be a forgone option</strong>.\r\n\r\n<cite>--\r\nNow, the true answer to your question: Yes, we are creating a new generation of drones. Why? It's because students are not taught by choice or lack thereof to be given many options to work and define their aspirations creatively. So as a society of parents and teachers, I believe subconsciously we are producing less free-willed and less free-thinking people than ever before.</cite>\r\n"
