    body: 'Over here in Italy there is a thing called "data certa", which is basically a stamp on a picture that certifies it was created before or on a certain date. It is also becoming more widespread the use of special cryptographic signatures for timestamping digital documents. Both methods award legal value to the documents. Of course this comes for a fee, but maybe in your case, if you plan to use those songs in Lunatics, it could be worth it. I found a website offering it for 9.68 including VAT per file, but I am sure you can find it for a lot less.'

    body: "No Jason, the solution to people revoking free licenses (it's on the cusp of fraud, really) is not to go the non-free route. And contacting the rights holder \"directly\" is often next to impossible, that's one big reason to use free licenses in the first place.\r\n\r\nIt's pure douchebaggery to pretend to offer your work under a free license, then hide the fact that you did. This means people think they'll be able to share and remix your work, and they might, and then you'll remove the evidence that you allowed it? \r\n\r\nJust save people the trouble and don't release it at all, under any license (including all rights reserved.) The media cartels are so intent on destroying the lives and livelihoods of anyone that reuses culture (and who doesn't?) that it's actually better to just NEVER PUBLISH than publish something non-free. I mean, I don't appreciate people playing crap on the radio that can't be used... for the same reason you wouldn't (as a programmer) appreciate someone reading NTKERNEL source code to you. Now you can't legally work on an alternative.\r\n\r\nI'm not saying everyone that commits this (almost?) licensing fraud is a douchebag. I think it's more likely they (usually) don't know what they're doing. There's an element of innocence to much of it... but it's still douchebaggery, it creates real liabilities for your fans, and it plagues Jamendo, which sucks as I'm a HUGE Jamendo fan. ARTISTS! ***STOP DOING THIS***. (It happens on bandcamp, too.) Artists need better teachers."
