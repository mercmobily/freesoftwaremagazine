Shuttleworth is in no way connected to Free Software Magazine.\r\n\r\n    I honestly believe that Ubuntu, together with Vista, will dent Microsoft's market share in the desktop market _considerably_. People seem to think that creating a distribution like Ubuntu is \"easy\". Well, it's not. It takes a lot of time and energy. Ubuntu is the only thing that I would ever suggest to those people who decide that they've had enough of viruses and so on, and want to break away from Microsoft.\r\n\r\n    Shuttleworth made Ubuntu possible. I really, really look up to him for what he did.\r\n\r\n    I am just giving credit where credit is due.\r\n\r\n    Merc.\r\n\r\n    ________________________________________\r\n\r\n        From: Richard Tyson\r\n        Url: richard@aztecsa.co.za\r\n        Date: 2006-03-22\r\n        Subject: Compliments\r\n\r\n        The fact that the interviewer complimented Mark Shuttleworth on his achievements just highlights the fact that he knows enough to appreciate the contributions made by Shuttleworth.\r\n\r\n        With enough determination Ubuntu can knock Microsoft off its perch and I for one hope it happens soon.\r\n\r\n        ________________________________________"
