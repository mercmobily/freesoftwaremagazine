It would be liberating for their egos to collapse.\r\n\r\nMyself, I would enjoy the ego-gratifying experience of changing society for the better. \r\n\r\nAnyway, our contrary social vision, money and ego-gratification - those are the stakes for most people, whether we acknowledge them explicitly or not.\r\n\r\nIs that so terrible to want some money or the ego-gratification of defeating a powerful opposition group? Have I really lost the moral high-ground?"

    body: "I totally agree with the sentiments of this article.  Microsoft will absorb the open source way of doing business, - or they will become more and more irrelevant.  Open source is superior for any business that embraces it.  Those that refuse to embrace it become more and more irrelevant because they simply can't compete against open source as long as people are free to choose.  The only way Microsoft will continue to dominate with their current business practices is if freedom is turned backward.  If freedom in software continues on its present course, open source software will dominate.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nCharles Witt - San Antonio, Texas USA"

    body: "\"if they stop trying to generate revenue from something they did in the past\" \r\n\r\nWell said.  I've never thought of the open vs closed software in those terms before, but I think you are precisely correct.  The closed source model is a software philosophy that needs to be protected and hidden from view to prosper.   This has generally happened for the last decade as typical Windows users passively accept more and more restriction on how they use their data on their own computers.  Microsoft may have hit a tipping point with the release of Vista with its mandated DRM.  On the other hand, open source, and Linux in particular, greatly benefits from sharing their code to reach a critical mass of users.  I just can't see how the Microsoft model is sustainable in the long run."

    body: "You've allowed the meanness of Microsoft to bring you down, yes. I'm not saying you're lower than Microsoft, but _that isn't saying much_.\r\n\r\nI so hate repeating this cliche, but it is still true: two wrongs don't make a right. Vengence is never a good motivation, not so much because your enemy doesn't deserve it, as because it is bad for _you_.\r\n\r\nWe're trying to _build_ something here, not tear down Microsoft, and if we reduce our role to competitor with Microsoft, we are _really_ selling ourselves short.\r\n\r\nDon't play their game by defining yourself as their enemy. Microsoft management sees \"Linux\" as a rival, but they are deluding themselves. We are not so small, nor so limited as Microsoft is -- it's a false rivalry. To free software, surpassing Microsoft is only a milestone (even if it is an important one).\r\n\r\nAlso, on a more human level, are you sure you want to be the kind of person who needs another person's suffering to pump up your own ego? I know I don't. \r\n\r\nUltimately, delight in their destruction is only the reflection of terror in their success. If you _really_ have confidence in what you _say_ you believe (free software is a better system / proprietary software will not persist), you should have nothing to fear, and thus nothing to hate.\r\n"

They are appropriate for those who are reactionary and who lack constructive vision. \r\n\r\nI'm not trying to avoid confrontation nor to give the impression that my motivation is selfless. I don't want to be mistaken for the type who wants to sacrifice and gain nothing. \r\n\r\nI want some of that incredible revenue which proprietary software vendors are currently enjoying. \r\n\r\nI don't mind gaining at their expense, nor do I intend to have a solemn attitude about their loss, because they are so damned gratuitous themselves.\r\n\r\nI think it's time for some new entrepreneurs to prove that we too can enjoy prosperity but without being anti-social and throwing chairs. \r\n\r\nI won't pretend that I'm not amused by the wailing and gnashing of teeth of those who've been behaving so boorishly and anti-socially for so many years. \r\n\r\nI see no reason to make their transition to free software an easy one because they're only investing in free software out of a desire to subvert the common good with software patent claims. \r\n\r\nMicrosoft is still trying to colonize, divide and conquer and we would be foolish to let our guard down or to end our struggle before we've reached a decisive finish.\r\n\r\nLastly, I don't aspire to be without an ego. There is the idea of a balance between having too much and not enough ego. This idea has its basis in Freudian psychology. \r\n"

    body: "I would like to be as optimistic as you but to me their strategy is crystal-clear: think Microsoft will do anything neccesary to kill the very concept of Free(dom) Software (as of the GNU/GPL and the FSF), while at the same time they will try to taxate on everything open-source through software patents agreements (mind Novell), while at the same time striving to re-define the rules of \"openness\", of course they will take away the re-distribution ability insisting on their \"end-user\" thing and \"non-transferable\" licensing thing.\r\n\r\nAlso here you have a classic excerpt from Eric Raymond in which it explains why Microsoft won't ever change. So ultimately it will be their model or Free Software, unless you admit them corrupting the very concept of software freedom and rennouncing the 4 liberties for quick easy cash (what Novell did), you can't have it both ways and they cannot co-exist with competition, they have to predate to survive:\r\n\r\nSource: http://esr.ibiblio.org/index.php?p=208\r\n\"    I had my serious, constructive converstation with Microsoft last year, when a midlevel exec named Steven Walli took me out to dinner at OSCON 2004 and asked, in so many words, “How can we not be evil?” And I told him — open up your file formats (including Word and multimedia), support open technical standards instead of sabotaging them, license your patents under royalty-free, paperwork-free terms.\r\n\r\n    I believe Steve Walli went back to his bosses and told them that truth. He is no longer with Microsoft, and what little he’ll say about it hints that they canned him for trying to change their culture.\r\n\r\n    This didn’t surprise me. Microsoft’s profit margins require a monopoly lock on the market; thus, they’re stuck with being predatory evil bastards. The moment they stop being predatory evil bastards, their stock price will tank and their options pyramid will crash and it will be all over.\r\n\r\n    That being the case, negotiation is pointless. Microsoft is not reformable. Jeering at offers like this is actually the most constructive thing we can do.\"\r\n\r\nSo much for the allegued \"openness\" and \"open source friendliness\" of Microsoft: There is no such thing. Just look at what Bill G.(still the brain behind the scenes) told the press yesterday:\r\nThey want to open the breach inside the FOSS community separating tame just-business-friendly patent-friendly open-source from free(dom) software and marginalise(and eventually kill) the GPL and the FSF.\r\nHe goes as far as downplaying the benefits of open\r\nsource software in medical science projects (better leave it to Gates' charity)\r\nNotice they keep insisting on software patentability and that no matter if it is open source they want to make you pay for software (and Novell is helping them in pursuing this strategy).\r\n\r\nSource:\r\nhttp://blog.wired.com/wiredscience/2008/04/bill-gates-what.html\r\n\r\n\"    One thing Gates won’t be leaving behind in\r\nretirement is his distaste for open source software.\r\nAfter one scientist asked if Gates would consider open\r\nsource uses in health research, the man who built his\r\n$280 billion company on the power of intellectual\r\nproperty bristled.\r\n\r\n    “There’s free software and then there’s open\r\nsource,” he suggested, noting that Microsoft gives\r\naway its software in developing countries. With open\r\nsource software, on the other hand, “there is this\r\nthing called the GPL, which we disagree with.”\r\n\r\n    Open source, he said, creates a license “so that\r\nnobody can ever improve the software,” he claimed,\r\nbemoaning the squandered opportunity for jobs and\r\nbusiness. (Yes, Linux fans, we’re aware of how\r\ndistorted this definition is.) He went back to the\r\nanalogy of pharmaceuticals: “I think if you invent\r\ndrugs, you should be able to charge for them,” he\r\nsaid, adding with a shrug: “That may seem radical.” \r\n\r\nit’s very revealing that Microsoft tries to separate Free software (it tries to characterise it as gratis,i.e. zero cost, cheap, shoddy) from open source. Open source is, to Microsoft, mainly about visibility, but it wants it to be subjected to the same rules, including software patents. Where are those geniuses who defended Microsoft’s seemingly-friendly approach towards the OSI?\r\n"

    body: "Especially when you quoted Bill Gates on pharmaceutical drugs. \r\n\r\nI don't mean to diminish Bill Gates large contributions to the well-being of Africans, yet I have to wonder - how much of his charity money is spent on drugs for AIDS and Malaria which have an arbitrarily set price?\r\n\r\nThe Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation gives billions to African charities. Obviously, a large percentage of that money is spent on drugs with an arbitrary price. \r\n\r\nThat money ends up adding to the high profit margins of pharmaceutical companies. They spend it on some of the same lobbyists in Washington and the WTO who lobby on behalf of \"intellectual property\" protection which benefits companies like Microsoft in the end.\r\n\r\nI'm not saying Bill Gates doesn't have an honest humanitarian impulse. I believe he does. I simply disagree this idea that he can be the benevolent ruler of the software world. Things will be better after Microsoft has been down-sized.\r\n\r\nI agree with Brazil who chooses to manufacture anti-HIV drugs generically and without respect for the patent claims of the drug giants. For many people these arguments about so-called \"intellectual property\" will determine whether or not they survive. "
