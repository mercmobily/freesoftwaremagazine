He could have made hell lot of many and who knows another organisation like Microsoft. But he did not, just think what he is getting dedicating all his life to the ideas of freedom not only limited to software, but even to other areas like human rights. All this because he is a selfless guy who has a mission in life and that is not evil.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand Mr. G W Bush is an opportunitst just like GW Bush Senior, who does not holds any such credentials. And if you read all the literature related to killing of JFK, Gulf War, Elections against AlGore, Iraq, 9/11 and several others, you will certainly feel something of a hush-hush. So when a person like GW Bush is presented as a crusader in war against terrorism, you certainly become skeptical about the whole thing and begin smelling some plot rather than an honest crusade, based on idealism and value which is  why RMS is regarded even by people who do not necessarily agree with him.\r\n\r\nCheers"

The government gives this to an agency like the NSF to spend on software development.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But if the computer buyer makes a donation to software development himself, he can take a credit against the tax. He can donate to the project of his own choosing--often, chosen because he hopes to use the results when it is done. He can take a credit for any amount of donation up to the total tax he had to pay.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The total tax rate could be decided by a vote of the payers of the tax, weighted according to the amount they will be taxed on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The consequences:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The computer-using community supports software development.</li>\r\n<li>This community decides what level of support is needed.</li>\r\n<li>Users who care which projects their share is spent on can choose this for themselves.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>In the long run, making programs free is a step toward the post-scarcity world, where nobody will have to work very hard just to make a living. People will be free to devote themselves to activities that are fun, such as programming, after spending the necessary ten hours a week on required tasks such as legislation, family counseling, robot repair and asteroid prospecting. There will be no need to be able to make a living from programming.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Intriguingly, the \"post scarcity world\" is a remarkably similar concept to Marx's original idea of what \"true communism\" was supposed to be. Stallman also called his proposal a \"manifesto\", no doubt to draw attention to this kind of similarity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, to be fair, this is only one of several options Stallman described. I wouldn't classify Stallman as \"pro-communist\", but rather as \"neutral\" on the subject of communism versus capitalism. Perhaps his position has evolved over time, but there's ample reason to believe he's still on that fence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He has made a number of cautious statements of approval of capitalism, but that's not the same thing as supporting it. His position is basically that \"it isn't always evil\".</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Is this bad? Not necessarily. I don't think capitalism is the be-all and end-all of civilization either. I think it has its place, and there are definite areas where capitalism is a Bad Idea (for example, this is why medical coverage in the United States is the disaster it currently is—for all its admitted ills, state socialized medicine would be a far better solution than what we have now).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, for good or ill, there's little doubt in my mind that, given the power, Stallman would certainly be tempted by socialized approaches to funding the public good. So if you think that's a bad idea, then he's probably not your man for the White House.</p>\r\n\r\n"

In other words, it's a policy of \"fighting racism with racism\".\r\n\r\nAs such, it is of course, subject to the same criticisms that apply to all uses of institutionalized violence: what makes us better than the people we're fighting?\r\n\r\nTo someone from a sheltered background who does not understand the insidious nature of the still-pervasive racist hiring practices that exist in the US and an ideological faith in the power of the market to fix all ills, the need for affirmative action must surely seem questionable. To someone who grew up on the other side of the tracks, however, there's reason to believe it remains necessary.\r\n\r\nIn the end, I support affirmative action, but the position is strategic, not principled. Calling Raymond a racist because he disagrees with me, is highly overstating the case.\r\n\r\nLikewise, I acknowledge that there must be some limit to the ability of citizens to carry arms in a culture that knows how to make nuclear weapons—which could, in principle, allow one person to destroy millions. However, that said, I also believe that the 2nd amendment is a statement about the balance of true power in society, and that a government that insists on making its citizens powerless is not to be trusted.  For me, the serious problem is that the 2nd amendment does not make clear where the line should be drawn (nukes should be controlled, clubs certainly shouldn't be—but where is the line between them? Handguns? Assault rifles? Automatic weapons?).\r\n\r\nSo far, I wouldn't trust any one of these people in the White House (including Raymond). But I voted Torvalds, because a) he seems the most level headed of these four (which unfortunately isn't saying much—they all have famously short fuses), and b) because, not being a natural-born US citizen he will be disqualified, allowing us to hold a re-election for someone who is qualified.\r\n\r\nMind you, I wouldn't vote for <em>me</em>, either, if I were on the ballot, nor would I like the job. Everybody sees the glory, but President is a hard job—especially if you take it seriously. Bush seems to enjoy it, but that's mostly because he has no interest in fulfilling the job description.
