And do not even think of trying to email a tax office, they do not have email facilities, 'to protect your data'!"

It was launched as part of a campaign[2] by Free Software Foundation Europe.\r\n\r\nLinks:\r\n\r\n1. http://pdfreaders.org/\r\n\r\n2. http://fsfe.org/campaigns/pdfreaders/pdfreaders.html\r\n\r\nPS\r\n\r\nI found it slightly ironical (humorously) with regards to the article that commenting here requires an account here or at Facebook, Hotmail, AOL or Yahoo. Well, that's great unpaid advertising for those companies ;-) (just kidding)"

    body: 'They were going to encourage free software in UK government bodies a while ago, but proprietary lobbies ended up skewing it in their favor to prevent anti competiton (which is pretty ironic). Interestingly, if you study under institutions (personally Scottish Highlands), it''s possible to badger them into installing some FOSS software, but in all honestly, we''re pretty much forced into proprietary software, unable to install free software (unless it goes through the bureaucracy), so i wouldn''t say we''re anywhere close to leading the way.'
