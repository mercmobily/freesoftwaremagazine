At Social Web CMS we agree with Tony on many of the points and are working to fix them.\r\n\r\nOur first focus is on bug and security fixes followed by performance. There will be some new features along the way based upon community feedback. Security patches will be made available immediately. Anyone who wants to help contribute will be welcomed. The idea is to have a happy, helpful community."

    body: "Tony you should do more research before you write such a blatantly biased article. I monitor pligg's code updates from twitter and both changes and additions are made almost daily. \r\n\r\nThe security issues you mention could have only been caused by pligg's former lead developer Ashdigg, so that should tell you how secure this fork is going to be. \r\n\r\nAs mentioned on pligg's blog, they even had to hire an outside security expert to fix all Ashdigg's mistakes. I'm beginning to think that the true story is that AshDigg was fired from pligg.\r\n\r\n\r\n "

    body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nAlright...\r\n\r\n1) You entitled your post \"false facts\" (!)\r\n\r\n2) You did NOT provide a list of false facts or corrections\r\n\r\n3) You mention that you monitor Pligg's changes. It may be changing *now*, but I know for a fact that Pigg's SVN stalled on February.\r\n\r\n4) You blame the security problems on Ash. Ash was *the* previous maintainer of Pligg. Of course it was his fault! The same applies to me: of course Drigg's bugs are my fault! However, I would find it *immensely* annoying if I quit a project, and people blamed every problem on *me*\r\n\r\n5) As far as I've _seen_ (say it with me: \"seen\"), Pligg fixed its security problems only by copying what Ash had done to his fork. Please provide a link to the code changes made by this security expert -- and please don't mention any changes which match what Ash had done a day or so earlier\r\n\r\n6) Fired...?!? You entitle your post \"False Facts\" and then start a speculation about a free software project _firing_ its maintainer and main coder? Oh dear...\r\n\r\nGuys, _facts_. Show me that Pligg's code is not a humongous mess. Show me that the modules in the \"Pligg shop\" don't break the GPL. Tell me how karma works in Pligg. Show me that Pigg's database structure is not ^%^$%$%. Show me that the post deletion happening on the forums is a huge conspiracy theory. Tell me which part of what I wrote is wrong.\r\n\r\nBye, \r\n\r\nMerc."

Drigg is immensely more flexible. Bur Reddit is definitely better if what you want to do is... well, a purely \"voting\" site ala Digg.\r\n\r\nBut it's a lot harder to configure. If a lot of people stopped in fear in front of Drigg...\r\n\r\nMerc."
