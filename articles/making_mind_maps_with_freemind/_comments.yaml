There''s a nice resource for locating other mind mapping software at http://www.mind-mapping.org/ and you can read more about mind maps at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_map.'

    body: "Nice recipe! (I'm planning to try it with some red wine!)\r\n\r\nThere are other uses of mind-maps. I use one as my personal log file of the state of my Linux system. I have nodes about future plans, others about problems with branches of how I solved some. Other important issues are just other mind-maps linked to this central one... \r\n\r\nA general view of all my system uses to calm me down whenever I have to plan something or solve a problem. The nice folding of every branch let's me focus just on the part that I am interested at the moment.\r\n\r\nI must add that most of the nodes include an hyperlink to the refered part of the system, so it is easy to start every idea by opening my LINUX status Freemind-map."
