    subject: 'SA is better than NC for what you want (IMHO)'

    body: "I don't want to seem like another person \"demanding\" you change your license. In my opinion, your choice of license is your own to make. This is fundamental, and I'm sorry you've had people trying to push you around.\r\n\r\nHowever, I do feel that this rationale doesn't support your choice. In my opinion, I think that By-SA would serve your stated intent much better.\r\n\r\nIn particular, you say you are afraid of scalpers:\r\n\r\n> To clarify the NC point further, I actually have no real problem with people charging for my work, but in the past I have discovered that others were taking my work and grossly over-charging for them. This reduced the size of the audience and the impact of the work. Never again.\r\n\r\nTo clarify your experience here: what license were you using when this was happening? Are you really telling us that you released stuff under a By-SA license, you had people scalping it, and this had a negative impact on the free distribution of your work? (All three would have to be true to support your rationale for using NC).\r\n\r\nI find that very hard to believe, so if it's true, I would be very interested in it as a test case! It certainly would violate my understanding of the economics.\r\n\r\nUnder an SA license, the scalper's business model should be untenable unless they can somehow retain effective monopoly control over access to the work. If the work is available for free and people know this, then they're unlikely to pay the scalper (and if they are still willing, there must be a good reason, such as \"convenience\", \"packaging\", or a desire to support the scalper -- they might be fund-raising for a good cause, for instance).\r\n\r\nUsing an SA license (or for that matter, a By license) is one way of insisting that people do know: the scalper is legally required to post the author's attribution and licensing information. (Yes, I know that some people will violate the license, but NO license can protect you from that). With the CC \"By\" clause, in particular, you can insist on publishing the URL of original publication, if it contains verification of licensing and attribution (which the FSM page for Bizarre Cathedral does).\r\n\r\nIt's a common misunderstanding to think that NC just prevents people from charging for copies of your work, but it's actually much more far-reaching than that!\r\n\r\nAs a simple example, people can't legally put a copy of your comic on their homepage if they also have Google Ad Sense ads to offset their hosting costs (the definition of NC says nothing about _making a profit_ -- it's about _making revenue_, even if you are operating at a _loss_).\r\n\r\nAnother common example, is that a company can't use the comics on any site owned by them, regardless of whether it is connected to their profit-making activities or not (IOW, NC discriminates against the _user_, not just the _use_. I hesitate to even raise the point of what this means if you are self-employed).\r\n\r\nThese interpretations are based on the Creative Commons' own draft guidelines on what constitutes \"commercial use\". In fact, though, the issue of what constitutes \"non-commercial\" is so poorly defined that CC has (literally -- this is not a joke) [commissioned a study](http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/9557), with support from the Andrew W. Mellon foundation, in order to _figure out what it means_!\r\n\r\nNC has exactly one economically rational use case: you want to retain commercial rights in the work so you can sell them.\r\n\r\nIn practice, SA probably achieves this too, since most publishers will want to pay for the right to re-license exclusive derivatives of your work as a value-add. Otherwise, it's hard to justify the expense of a print run (they have to worry about scalpers too). But NC is the safest way to do this, I'll admit.\r\n\r\nBut if you're satisfied with the commission from FSM for Bizarre Cathedral, and you want the work to be freely available, then NC doesn't make much sense, IMHO.\r\n"

    body: "Thanks for your comment. To clarify something, the previous work was not released under a CC licence at all. CC did not exist then. It had a custom freeware licence which permitted a \"reasonable\" distribution charge to recover media and postage. This was in he very early days of the Web so most distribution was still done by CD.\r\n\r\nMy concern was and is more to do with the maximum number of people having access to the work at zero cost. Your examples of uses excluded by NC are good but you miss the point that you quoted. If somebody wants to put my cartoon on a site with Google Ads they just have to ask. If a company wants to put it on any of their websites - they just have to ask.\r\n\r\nThe reasons you gave supporting the use of SA are pretty much why I include it in the licence for tBC. \r\n\r\nYou said..\r\n\r\n> NC has exactly one economically rational use case: you want to retain commercial rights in the work so you can sell them.\r\n\r\nI'd agree with one amendment ...\r\n\r\n> NC has exactly one economically rational use case: you want to retain commercial rights in the work so **only** you **or those you permit** can sell them.\r\n\r\nIf I never wanted others to sell the works I would be using a standard copyright licence. As it is I am open to consider it but I reserve the right to decide in each case. That sums up why I include the NC. I am unlikely to sell copies of these toons but I might. I'll say this here for clarity: If anyone wants to include them on an otherwise non-profit site which has Google-Ads or similar then get in touch. You will probably find that I will allow it - I just want to know about it first.\r\n\r\nMy choice of licence is also connected to the reason for the work. In this case it's entertainment (I hope) and not education or instruction. If it were the latter I would probably not include the NC.\r\n\r\ncheers  \r\nRyan"

I release creative works (music and writing) under CC licenses, and I tend to vacillate between using NC and not.  The copyleft aspect of the SA clause seems enough to protect a work against blatant exploitation, but it's understandable why we sometimes gravitate to the idea of NC.  \r\n\r\nWhen I release a work CC, I want people to have the work to enjoy.  I'm not out to make money off of it, but if someone else is going to profit from my work I'd certainly like a cut.  I think there is a certain fundamental fairness to that.  Granted, things get a bit complicated when you try to nail down specifics, but on a larger scale I think this point of view is perfectly natural.\r\n\r\nThink about throwing a potluck for your friends. Nobody is required to bring food, and certainly there's no hard limit on how much food a person is allowed to take.  But if you had a guest who brought no food, swiped half the hot dogs off the grill, and started selling them to passers-by on the street, I think you'd rightfully be upset.  Or if the guy who brought the ketchup decides to charge 25 cents a squirt while helping himself to the hamburgers, buns, and potato salad everyone else provided for free -- I think you'd rightfully be upset.\r\n\r\nThe problem is, of course, that these are vague feelings and ideas, and when translating them into a set of legal limits you are going to end up either creating a loophole for someone to exploit you, or restricting people beyond what you intended or desire.

Although there are many aspects of the GPL that are specific to software, not restricting distribution or sale is rather fundamental, and so it is not clear at all that artwork should be considered differently. Additionally, with a non-commercial license your strip can't be distributed with a linux distribution or other Free software, since it impose such a restriction.\r\n\r\nAgain, there is nothing wrong with you using such a license, it simply means that your artwork is does not meet the definition of Free that is required of Free Software."

    body: "This is often quoted as a defense for NC, but it's basically spurious.\r\n\r\nFirst, it's _always_ true, no matter what license you use (or indeed if you post no license at all). So, in that sense, it's a trivial argument that applies to any license, no matter how restrictive.\r\n\r\nSecond, though some people argue that choosing a CC license is a \"signal\" to let people know you are \"open\" to \"free-licensing\"; in my experience, using an NC license usually means artists are only \"open\" to \"NC-licensing\" and that's it!\r\n\r\nThird, the real point about free-licenses is precisely that you _don't_ have to ask (or even find) the author. This eliminates a fundamental friction and doubt in the creative process. So, resorting to this argument sort of misses the whole point of free content in the first place. Instead of encouraging people to \"just go ahead and do it\" it makes them think (e.g.) \"gosh I could just be wasting my time, because this artist can just silence me by claiming I'm using their work commercially -- so maybe I won't bother\". IOW, having to ask for permission chills creative expression.\r\n\r\nSo, IMHO, we've drawn the line in the right place: there is a very real sense in which your comic is \"non-free\".\r\n\r\nWhich is fine with me. I have no problem with you not using a free license. It _is_ sort of amusingly ironic that a cartoon about free software isn't free content, but it doesn't really mean there's anything wrong with it. The difference between utilitarian and aesthetic work is also a real distinction.\r\n\r\nThere is always a balancing act between Intellectual Freedom and Intellectual Property. That's the nature of the beast. We aren't \"free\" to use content that doesn't exist, after all! So if we need some restrictions to make it exist, then we have to live with that.\r\n\r\nTo those who don't believe it _is_ needed? Fine. Make your own comic! Problem solved. That's what it means to have a \"free market of ideas\".\r\n\r\nThere's lots of non-free documentation (e.g. books) sold to support free software, and writing and selling such a book is one of several ways that a free software author can get paid for their work without having to restrict the software. Free documentation has a greater utility value because it is free, but it has to be balanced against the quality, which is usually a function of how much labor went into it, and that can in turn depend on IP-based income to make it possible. It's a trade-off, and which strategy wins depends on too many factors to make some kind of sweeping generalization about which is better.\r\n\r\nGetting paid for free creative artwork and writing is _much_ harder than getting paid for free software, and it's no surprise that a lot of artists are more resistant to the idea.\r\n\r\nIt's also true that for many purposes, \"NC\" work is \"free enough\" for content: I certainly don't restrict my reading, listening, or viewing time to free-licensed works (though I do give them some preference by seeking them out).\r\n\r\n"

If I honestly thought they would be I would have chosen a different licence. These images are meant for entertainment and any redistribution is likely to be for the same reason. You and others using the same argument as yourself appear to have made an assumption that I release all my artwork under NC type licences. I don't. I have created various images, icons etc. for use in websites and other media under licences with varying degrees of liberation. The NC is there for these particular strips because it suits my purposes in this instance. \r\n\r\nOpen-source would be a misleading term to use in any software package that included these strips as there is no source-code for these images. Any change made to them would have to be on top of the original - a derivative. Bitmap images just cannot be treated in the the same way as software.\r\n\r\n> The Creative Commons license without the NC part would be a perfectly reasonable extension of this idea for artwork, but otherwise your license is simply not open-source / Free.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the artwork is an important factor in choosing a licence. With software I believe it's important that the user can use the software for any purpose they choose. With artwork the purpose is largely built into the image. If the image is a diagram explaining how to perform a task then the purpose is educational. If the image is a photo of a a picturesque landscape the purpose leans more towards the aesthetic. If the image is a strip cartoon with (I hope) humourous message then the purpose is going towards entertainment. In the first case it would be harder to argue for an NC than in the latter two cases.\r\n\r\n> I have no problem with your choice of license\r\n\r\nThanks.  \r\nRyan"

It's one thing to have a free bitmap image or a free audio recording, but it's _much_ more useful to have a vector graphic or an audio sequencer project file and samples or MIDI and instrument patches.\r\n\r\nThese kinds of formats encourage cooperative development, and can be modified and adapted by people _less skilled_ than the people who originally created them!\r\n\r\nHowever, even in cases where there _is_ \"source code\" for art and music, it's often ambiguous which particular set of files constitutes the \"source code\". For example, if you created an image in Adobe Illustrator for my project, I don't actually want your .AI files, I want the .SVG files converted from them.\r\n\r\nThe GPL and other free licenses refer to \"the preferred form for making modifications to the work\", but they don't tell you _WHO_ prefers it: the original artist, the latest artist to work on the project, some vague concept of consensus? (Truthfully, this can be a problem for software too, but the consensus is usually stronger).\r\n\r\nMyself, I would prefer for the metric here to be the use of open standards, so that it doesn't matter which particular authoring applications you use.\r\n\r\nHowever, it's also true that \"open standards\" is only a vaguely-defined term, so it would be very hard to pin it down to an exact legal meaning (about the best you could do is refer to an approved list, and that would wind up being an unnecessary bottle-neck for many projects).\r\n\r\nBecause this is such a minefield, the Creative Commons decision to stand off from the issue and not make source code requirements is a practical one. They've converted this to a simple requirement that distributions not _intentionally impede derivation_ through \"technical protection measures\" or \"digital rights management\".\r\n"

    body: "I believe the most commonly shared reasoning for BY-SA instead of BY-NC-SA is in response to aggregation projects and end users who simply decide that BY-NC-SA is grounds for automatic exclusion... usually due to one of the following:\r\n\r\n1. They decide the additional cognitive and/or administrative overhead (amateur vs. pro, usually) of tracking and managing a library of resources which includes some NonComm-licenses just isn't worth the benefit. (Loss: You, since this type of user can usually easily find competitors who offer BY-SA or equivalent and all that's lost is your opportunity for free promotion)\r\n\r\n2. They're producing an aggregate (eg. DVD) for either fundraising or offline educational purposes (typically in places like Africa where reliable internet is a luxury at best) and, for legal reasons, they consider classifying their work as non-commercial to be difficult and getting individual permission to impose far too much overhead. (Loss: You. Again, plenty of competitors with more liberal licenses who will be happy to get the free promotion said aggregate represents.)\r\n\r\nThe second-most common reasoning I've seen is a variation on the one that the Creative Commons licenses were created to mitigate... the orphan works problem.\r\n\r\nI admit I may be biased, given that I run an archive of fanfiction that would potentially have been lost even with original U.S. copyright terms. (Stories whose authors dropped off the web, taking their sites with them... all in less than 15 years and most in less than 10)\r\n\r\nI could be wrong, but as I understand it, supposing SlideShare went under or, like MP3.com, was bought out sans catalog, any other site which wanted to archive BY-NC-SA presentations could be in danger of lawsuits if they both displayed advertising and didn't request author permission.\r\n\r\nI admit that CC licenses significantly limit the problem by granting non-commercial redistribution rights as a non-optional component. However, the point remains that people are, in general, overly optimistic about their ability and desire to remain reachable to grant additional permissions in the long-term.\r\n\r\nGiven the ridiculous lengths to which copyright terms have been extended, the likelihood that it will happen again, and the behaviors I've observed with cases of license violation of various kinds, I've come to the conclusion that, on the whole, licensing your work with an NC license is only useful for things like MIT OpenCourseware where there is otherwise a danger of your honest competitors taking advantage of your generosity.\r\n\r\nFor things posted legitimately on sites like SlideShare, a BY-NC-SA license is likely to have the following effects:\r\n\r\n1. The majority of end users won't care, as the non-commercial term doesn't affect them. The bigger issue with them is all your other competitors (under varying licenses) who are also clamoring for attention.\r\n\r\n2. People looking to aggregate may or may not search elsewhere, depending on the kind of aggregation (primarily blog vs. other) and the intended purpose.\r\n\r\n3. People looking to make money, especially in places like China, will likely ignore your license, operating under the assumption that the license doesn't matter since they'll never get caught and you're not a lawyered-up multi-national anyway. (This isn't just limited to GPL code. It also happens frequently with educational materials like slides where someone will scrape the web, scrub the license and author contact information, and trick people into paying for it)\r\n\r\n4. In the long term, the freer flow of content among and between projects in the BY-SA sphere like Wikibooks and other Wikimedia projects will favor non-NC information, pushing NC-licensed content further out of the spotlight... potentially resulting in it having dropped off the web in 95 years (or Life+90 years or whenever it finally enters the public domain), granting others whatever small measure of immortality bibliographic citations and archived changelogs may offer."
