    body: "HTC have released an over the air upgrade for the Hero now - apparently. I say apparently because it's only available in certain countries and only if you bought the Hero and didn't get it \"free\" from a carrier.\r\n\r\nIf - like me - you got it as part of a carrier bundle then you are stuffed as you have to wait for the carrier to pull their fingers out and further \"tweak\" the HTC \"tweaks\" to the Android update. I'm still waiting - have been for a few months now.\r\n\r\nHere's how it gets worse though. When HTC released the last upgrade to the Hero (1.5 to 1.6) it was available as a download only and then you had to apply it via a sync on the phone from a desktop PC. Oh did I mention that the HTC Hero *only* syncs with Windows? Not even Mac, let alone Linux. So I had to borrow someone's Windows box just to upgrade my *free software driven* phone!\r\n\r\nThat said, like you I am loathe to say \"don't buy one\" because it is simply a great piece of kit. They just need to get on board with the people who are using their phones because of it's free software base.\r\n\r\n\\-\\-  \r\nEquitas IT Solutions - fairness, quality, freedom  \r\nhttp://www.equitasit.co.uk"

Wouldn't it be great if there was a true Open Source phone that came with all the source code, drivers, documentation and help from the manufacturer?\r\n\r\nWell, one company is going to do exactly that and release a CCR (Certified Community Release) Program. This young Spanish company is Geeks'Phone, whose first device, the ONE, was released in January, only 6 month after the company was created:  a huge achievement. While the phone is not available from any carriers, they still have managed to build a good customers base.\"\r\n"

Since some of those people work for companies who tivoize, that's hard. Shame because it looks like it going to bite us in the future. "

MeeGo, the next-gen iteration, is a fairly standard Linux product (even if it does use rpm ;-) that is quite rootable as well. Of course, the first MeeGo phone probably won't be on the market until the fourth quarter, but the N900 runs the QT4-based apps written for MeeGo, and its hardware specs are still comparable to most Android phones even 8 months after the ship date.\r\n\r\nImperfect as it is, Nokia does seem to be lightyears ahead of the Android crowd in terms of respecting the user's freedom.  (Disclaimer: I have an N900, but the rest of my family uses Android phones.)\r\n\r\n"

If you are not getting what you really want, then resist the urge to have the cool, but restrictive, technology.

    body: "In the ongoing OS wars, Linux is <em>winning</em>.  Versions of Linux are now available for just about everything, and Linux is showing up in places most folks aren't even aware of.  For instance, my wireless router uses an embedded Linux 2.4 kernel. Most folks buying devices with embedded Linux probably won't even be <em>aware</em> Linux is under the hood, and if the device is correctly designed, there's no reason they <em>should</em> be.\r\n\r\nGoogle Android is based on Linux, and getting a lot of traction in the marketplace.  The Motorola Droid, for example, put Motorola back into the cellphone race.  And because it's Android, it has a coolness factor. How many folks with an Android powered phone do you think are aware that there's a Linux kernel underneath?  I'd guess, a minority, and possibly a <em>small</em> minority.  \r\n \r\nBut Android is compelling for manufacturers.  It's designed for embedded and handheld use.  It does multitasking and multi-threading out of the box.  It's modular, and OEMs can build images including only the parts supporting their hardware and use cases.  It's well developed with a large number of developers working on it and apps to run on it.\r\n\r\nAnd best of all, Android is free as in beer.  Anyone can pick it up and build systems powered by it, and there are no licensing fees, as there would be with things like Windows.\r\n\r\nThis popularity has consequences.  One is that Linux winds up being under the hood in huge numbers of devices where the user has no normal reason to pop the hood, and you probably don't want them to in any case.  Cell phones are a really good example.\r\n\r\n<em>\"They won’t let you access the boot loader, and — worse — they won’t release software upgrades for their phones because they want you to buy the next model, with the next version of the software.\"</em>\r\n\r\nGuess what?  That's what the users will do in any case.  These days, a cell phone is primarily a <em>fashion accessory</em>, and most users buy the one they think is coolest that does what they want it to do.  They are likely to upgrade to a new devices whenever their cell phone contract runs out, and there's almost certain to <em>be</em> a newer sexier model they'll covet. \r\n\r\nThey want the latest and greatest to \"keep up with the Joneses\" in their social circle, and look down upon those behind the curve.  The HTC Hero? That's <em>so</em> last year...\r\n\r\nAnd bear in mind that HTC is an OEM.  For the most part, <em>they</em> don't sell the phone to you.  Your <em>carrier</em> does.  The carrier will chose to pick up models they think they can sell to their customer base, but what they're selling isn't hardware, it's service contracts.  The hardware is the shiny to get you to <em>sign</em> a contract with them.  UIs are one way in which vendors differentiate their phones, so no surprise HTC doesn't use the stock Android UI.\r\n\r\nThe <em>vast</em> majority of folks buying Android powered phones will have no desire to get root, or even know what it is.  The phone will do what they want it to do out of the box, and if it doesn't, \"there's an app for that!\".  And if you're the vendor, exactly how thrilled will you be at the idea that it's easy for people to <em>get</em> root?  If you <em>are</em> the vendor, you'll probably cringe in horror at the potential support nightmare.  You had to go to great lengths to get root on your Android device, but if you break it in the process, it's <em>your</em> problem.  Neither HTC nor Telstra are under any obligation to assist you.\r\n\r\nIf getting root on your Linux device is that important to you, it becomes to item on your checklist when you are looking to buy.  \"Can I get root on this?  No?  Next choice...\"  In the stated use case, look at the Nokia N900, the first of their Internet Tablet line to be a cell phone as well.  Nokia's Maemo environment <em>will</em> allow you to get root.  (An old friend got Android phones for wife and daughter, but an N900 for himself so he <em>could</em> get root.)\r\n\r\nI don't have an Android phone.  My current cell phone is probably the the smallest, cheapest model Nokia makes.  It places and receives calls and SMS and has voice mail, and that's about all it does.  Fine by me - that's all I <em>want</em> it to do.  I may get an Android phone down the road, but I probably won't <em>care</em> if I can get root on it. I'll only care that it does what I want it to do, and it's on me to pick the right one.  If I find myself needing to get root, it will be a good bet I made the wrong choice when I bought it.\r\n______\r\n<strong>Dennis</strong>"

    body: "I don't think it would slow down or stop spread of Linux. And I also don't think there is any good reason for manufacturers to tivoize or. If you look at GPLv3, you would see that it doesn't straight out forbid tivoization. It just says that manufacturer must provide customers with a way to unlock their device. If the user is not interested, he don't need to unlock it, it is not mandatory. \r\n\r\nManufacturer should not have power over the user who bought the device. When I buy the device I want to own it, hence I expect manufacturer to document how I can root it. \r\n\r\n\"Way too many outfits using Linux under the hood have good reasons for the handcuffs, and would promptly go to something else that did not put cuffs on them by restricting exactly how they could implement the product.\"\r\n\r\nTell me one situation where there is a good reason to tivoize? Voting machines don't count because voters never get the right under GPL since they don't get to own the machine. Things like pacemakers don't count either because it is not \"User Product\" so the tivoization clause don't apply(look at GPLv3 to see what is defined \"User Product\"). Using GPLv3 don't put handcuffs on them, it only prevents them to put handcuffs on users. And if they drop Linux, what they will use? BSD? That even don't support ARM. \r\n\r\n\"And even it you do impose that change, how much practical good will it do? The GPL is consensual. While it technically has the force of law, it really works because everyone involved agrees to abide by the rules it sets.\"\r\n\r\nYou obviously don't know much about GPL. GPL is based on copyright law and has been enforced many times. In fact, there was one win just recently http://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/08/04/gpl_violation_westinghouse/\r\n\r\nThat is GPLv2, but v3 has also been enforced. Violators usually settle and decide to comply with the license when they see they can't win, but sometimes (like on linked case) they foolishly go to the end and lose miserably. There is a organization called SFLC (Software Freedom Law Center http://www.softwarefreedom.org/) which does the suing in the name of developers so you don't need to pay legal expenses to get GPL violator to comply.  \r\n\r\nHome country of violator doesn't matter. GPL has been enforced in Europe, Japan, and all over the world. I don't know about China and their regime, but if company does business in US, they get sued there and they must either comply or get their violating product of the market. US revenues are usually big and important to companies, so they will comply.  \r\n\r\n"

And then having to rinse and repeat again in 3 years.
