    body: "That is what this Special 301 is really about. FOSS continues to cut into the proprietary software revenue stream, and this is the only way they know to stop the bleeding.\r\n\r\nFWIW, I'm considered a conservative (Republican if you want to go that far), but I am also smart enough to think about where my money goes and to get the best value for it. It is because of that way of thinking that first got me started using FOSS. The other benefits of FOSS came to light after I started using it and \"sealed the deal\". I use proprietary software because I have to for work, but even then I look for and use (whenever possible) FOSS to better do my job.\r\n\r\nCall me a pinko, communist if you must, but I am not a criminal for thinking for myself.\r\n"
