    body: "You argue that open source undermines the Freedom concept that is so central to the Free Software movement, but Free Software has somehow 'put off' users, and we need a new moderate term. Funny, that's pretty much where the term 'open source' came from in the first place, as an attempt to provide a new, more moderate reframing of 'Free' software. But whatever the next term is (FLOSS etc.) it can't emphasize Freedom more than the original term Free Software. \r\n\r\nMaybe what we really need is to address the issue head on. Not in a foaming at the mouth, raving zealot kind of way, but rather in a nuanced, balanced and sober presentation. Much like Eben Moglen does in his speeches. He doesn't shy away from the concept of Freedom, and yet he still manages to make persuasive arguments without alienating listeners.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing wrong with the phrase 'Free Software'. We need to educate ourselves about the concepts and their history, and then have the courage to present them to others in a respectful manner. If you really believe that Free Software is a worthwhile alternative, then you won't need to resort to name-calling and raving. And if you can keep your arguments civil and well-informed, eventually people will come around. But searching for a catchier phrase is taking the easy way out. \r\n\r\nIf the concept is good, it will sell itself when people have the information to make an informed decision. Given all the solid arguments in favour of Free Software, if someone needs a trendy new catch-phrase to take it seriously then I question whether they're the sort of people we should put a high priority on persuading. Better to slowly build a strong base than to quickly build a weak one.\r\n\r\nTyler\r\n"

Free, in the minds of consumers, suggests that they are not responsible for 'valuing' the software that they use.  We need to acknowledge the value of a given software author(s) contribution AND remunerate them in the manner that THEY choose appropriate.\r\n\r\nSome only ask for a postcard telling them how you use their program.

It would be easier to find it (ie. by googling) an newcomers would get less confused. But complicated as the world is, there isn't such a word which would express all that we value about Free/Open Source Software. Maybe we should create a whole new word, but the chances for broad adaption are quite small... :-)\r\n\r\nI hope one day, when we're talking about software, we just mean FOSS only, because free software has become ubiquitous, and proprietary software is an old myth of a strange transition-time where old (industrial) business models were used on a then-new phenomenon called software."

The most common definition used is the one from the Open Source Initiative, starting in 1998, as an offshoot of the free software movement. I don't know if the term was used before that. I think before Richard Stallman ran into his troubles with nonfree software, and especially a decade before that, software was generally free and open source, as it was distributed in source form, and programmers weren't restricted from copying or modifying it. Therefore, I wouldn't expect anyone would have used any particular terms for free and open source software, because that was generally all software. From what I can tell, Richard Stallman only started the GNU project and the free software movement specifically because he started encountering proprietary software, and it started becoming more common than free software. Then again, I could be wrong.\r\n\r\n--\r\nGNU - free as in freedom"

I think combined terms should generally just be used to talk about  the software collectively without promoting either of the two sets of ideas. People who only support one of the two generally just want to use one of the terms most of the time. 'Open source' also isn't as good a term if you care about the freedom people have to use their software, rather than just producing good quality software. That's because the actual name only tells you that the source code can be looked at, and not what freedom people have to modify and redistribute it. Access to the source code is only a precondition for two of the four key freedoms in the definition of free software.\r\n\r\n--\r\nGNU - free as in freedom"

The name \"free software\" didn't exist because free software was all that existed.\r\n\r\nThe problem is, people took free software for granted and as a result, people lost their freedom. Stallman found his loss of freedom so distasteful that he decided to start the GNU project which was dedicated to providing people with a free operating system. Stallman defined the term \"Free Software\" because there was a need for a term that embodied the ideals of free software.\r\n\r\nI use the term \"Free Software\" because the term \"Open Source\" does not place any emphasis on the ideals of free software. This is important because we will lose our freedom if we don't value it. Stallman lost his once and I don't want it to lose it in the future. Open Source doesn't emphasise freedom. People are less likely to understand the value of the freedom of Free Software and therefore be more likely to lose it under that term."

Subconsciously, 'FREE' screams out 'No money involved - you will not earn a living here - at least, not in the short term'. And this is reinforced by the fact that copies of free software can be made for free - legally!\r\n\r\nIt would be better if instead of explaining software in terms of the publishing author giving privileges away (free surrender of commercially advantageous restrictions), it was explained in terms of the author/purchaser not having their rights taken away (all rights restored - truth+privacy+liberty), e.g. \"This software is not free of charge.
