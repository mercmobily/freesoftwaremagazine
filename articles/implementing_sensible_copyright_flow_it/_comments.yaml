They would have to make legally sanctioned templates to put on websites, maybe with some javascript that automatically changes the displayed license when reached the date.."

    body: "I posted the idea on the cc-licenses list back when they were considering the new 3.0 licenses. But there wasn't much interest. Most people seemed to think the \"Founder's Copyright\" failure meant no one would use such a system or that the NonCommercial licenses etc would be adequate. Obviously, I disagree.\r\n\r\nThere's no _legal_ reason why this has to be affiliated with CC at all. The CC licenses are free to use, and you can write a grant statement anyway you please, really. A couple of other people noted this point and felt it didn't need to be part of CC, IIRC.\r\n\r\nOf course, it would be enormously more likely to succeed if CC supported it.\r\n\r\nThe main reason I haven't used such a system myself is that most of my writing is By-SA to start with. I may do something like this with my next book, though.\r\n"
