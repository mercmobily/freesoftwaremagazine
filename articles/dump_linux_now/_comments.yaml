When I first heard (and dived head first into) Linux world, there was some amount of poking and proding involved.\r\n\r\nSome tweaking here, system hangs, ihaling the man pages to find out, what the trouble was, et cetera, et cetera.\r\n\r\nNow its so ... boring! (I <em>do</em> agree very much with the author)\r\n\r\nI remember taking my laptop (Acer TravelMate 2428) and installing Ubutu 6.06 in it.  I had suspected that I'll have at least a week's work to get on WiFi at college.  Sadly, the network was detected and I was online before I knew what to do.\r\n\r\nSome weenies blabbing about Desktop Linux would argue that Linux is near the mark.  But I see it different.  I always re-phrase the question \"Is Linux ready for Desktop?\" to \"Are you ready for Desktop Linux?\".\r\n\r\nWell, maybe the Hurd will become the OS we've always dreamed of.  Pray no company hijacks the development and leaves all the geeks stranded looking for an alternative.\r\n\r\nSo if Linux is dumped, what will we do with Windows?  Should we adopt it as an alternative?  What will we do with all the converts trying to enlighten their friends with GNU/Linux?  What will we..\r\n\r\nI guess the author will answer me.\r\n\r\nAlong the same lines I blame it on all the \"commercial\" companies that are backing up the Linux hype that's ruining the geek paradise.\r\n\r\n\"Where we go from here, is a choice I leave to you\"  -- Neo\r\n"

Shouldn't the goal have been to make an OS that is open and free and usable. I don't think boring is such a bad thing in this case. It just means that if you want to go beating yourself over the head trying to learn something new, then Linux is probably not the way to go. I like that there are other projects out there that want to grown up like Linux did. We should cherish this time. The moments before Linux begins taking up desktops of Moms, grandparents, children, and Mac users. We are in the beginning of the era of open software. Now to make it really successful you must find a way for companies to profit from it. Otherwise truly profunctary research will go down the drain. As a geek I'm with you. Time to beat ourselves over the head learning something new. Our children will thank us for everything we did to make Linux mainstream.\r\n\r\nOpen Source is the only way to go."

But for my main desktop machine, I felt the need for something a little more exciting. That's why it's running Gentoo. It was an adventure to set up, and it continues to be an adventure in day-to-day use. Every time I update something, I can't be sure what's going to stop working.

Its potential is untapped.\r\n\r\nSupporting this sort of work will have an impact - imagine a world where a low-cost, high-volume, readily available entertainment console makes a better PC than a PC ... its going to make a difference.

It's like blaming the TV if you become a couch potato.\r\n\r\nMore graphical tools are available for Linux. If you want to, you CAN use them. If not, all of the pre-graphical commands are still there. That's what's great about it. You can burn a CD with K3B, or use cdparanoia. I have Linux servers installed without any X11 at all - just console (plain, ugly and low memory footprint). I have one computer which I keep on the bleeding edge - everything compiled from source and with all sorts of tweaks and tuning, 99% beta software, easy to break in new and exciting ways. On the other hand I have my work computer installed with plain Ubuntu edgy - because that is a computer I just want to switch on and work with. There are times when I DON'T want an exciting OS, I just want a functioning, familiar, simple OS where I spend my time working on it, not making it work. In fact, I don't want to be aware of the OS at all.\r\n\r\nSome of the OS's you mentioned sound like they're going to be interesting in the future, but at the moment most of them are only interesting to OS developers and the like - the OS becomes the main application rather than a platform for using other, productive, application software."
