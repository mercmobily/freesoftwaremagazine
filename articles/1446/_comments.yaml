    body: " \r\n<strong>Comment from: Andre Jolivet [Visitor]</strong>\r\n\r\n    2005-12-17 @ 14:34\r\n    One important point is missing in this article : many proprietary software vendors try to lock you in their proprietary standards (like .doc files) to make sure you are a returning customer (willy nilly). Free software does not. It is a matter of open standards. Open standards always win. One other point is progress. To build a new open source GPL software, you can quickly build from other GPL software. You cannot with proprietary software. Only the very big proprietary software companies have the needed bricks available in house, says internet tools like firewall, browser, graphics tools, word processing tools. So, at the end, with the growth of complexity you have only two choices : a few very big companies locking you in and trying their best to kill all other options and open source. My choice is done. And I wish governments and regulation authorities will quickly step in to fix that.\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>Comment from: Mememe [Visitor]</strong>\r\n\r\n    2005-12-18 @ 22:50\r\n    Lot of specious reasoning here... For instance you label \"free\" software as only those that are GPL'd (without actually stating that)... There are a number of other licenses (Apache for instance) that are also free but accomodate BOTH models.\r\n\r\n    Also, there is NO direct connection between \"free software\" and \"open standards\"... One DOES NOT imply the other... Open standards are a good idea but have little to do with free software...\r\n\r\n    Finally, GPL can be just as limiting as the proprietary model in that YOU MUST make your changes free. This makes making any money out of your software nearly impossible... Sounds good for the freeloaders but people still have bills to pay. Nearly all of those contributing to GPL projects (with some notable exceptions) are working for companies that create proprietary software... If all software in the world was GPL then software development would die, because those trying to produce would die, because they don't have jobs to pay for food anymore, simple equation really...\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>Comment from: jeff bowden [Visitor]</strong>\r\n\r\n    2005-12-20 @ 05:20\r\n    Um I hate to break it to you, but the analogy between wikipedia and open source software is pretty weak. Wikipedia is a service. It is a public database. It is not a piece of software.\r\n\r\n    What's more, the license under which wikipedia content is distributed is not even DFSG free.\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>Comment from: Willem [Visitor]</strong>\r\n\r\n    2005-12-20 @ 08:38\r\n    @Mememe; he's is right in only labeling GPL'ed software as Free, Free software is software that is guaranteed to stay free, as the GPL is the only license that guarantees the software stays free. This oppossed to Open Source software, such as licenced by ASF and BSD licences. It's perfectly legal for me to relicense those into proprietary licenses, so the software is not free, or even open source anymore...\r\n\r\n    Remeber, Free Software means it's the software that is free, not it's users...\r\n\r\n    That's why the GPL is maintained by the FSF and all other Open Source licenses by the OSI, it's a big difference.\r\n\r\n    When i make my code available under ASF or BSD, there is nothing that keeps M$ from hijacking my code, when i GPL it that is legally impossible. Which code you reckon can get labeled free?\r\n\r\n    greetings,\r\n\r\n    Willem\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>Comment from: Guido Sohne [Visitor] Ã‚Â· http://sohne.net</strong>\r\n\r\n    2005-12-20 @ 14:31\r\n    I wrote something comparing these as well. Many disagree with my approach. What gives me heart is I get disagreements from both sides, so either I am completely wrong, or I am on to something.\r\n\r\n    See http://sohne.net/2005/12/13/some-differences-between-free-and-proprietary-software\r\n\r\n    At least, I hope that there have been more ideas from this exercise than just the standard ones we hear all the time.\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>Comment from: Bobber [Visitor]</strong>\r\n\r\n    2005-12-20 @ 15:30\r\n    Since Free Software argues for original intent with regard to the constitution (on copyright and patent), I conclude it is a conservative and thus Red philosophy (not Blue).\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>Comment from: Willem [Visitor]</strong>\r\n\r\n    2005-12-21 @ 12:22\r\n    Bobber: You guys have got patents in the constitution??!!??? Patents are by definition in conflict with the free market, so when you have anti-competitive incents in the constitution it's no wonder the US economy can only survive with China money....\r\n\r\n    But then again, i doubt you're statement about constitution is educated...\r\n"
