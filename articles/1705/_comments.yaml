Don't care all that much.\r\n\r\nI guess I'm an emancipated man.\r\n\r\nYou didn't mention it, but GNOME's recent call for women to participate in the Summer of Code was apparently pretty successful. Hanna Wallach says they got 200+ applications (which, interestingly, is more than the total number who applied in the genderless call -- none of whom were women).\r\n\r\nWhich raises questions: why didn't those women apply before? Did they think they couldn't win? Or had they simply never heard of the opportunity? Clearly having a special women's contest was a good idea this year, but what about next? Should they continue to have an \"all comers\" and a \"ladies only\" call?  Separate mens' and womens' calls (i.e. like we do with sports)?\r\n\r\nThe idea that women might've assumed without trying that they wouldn't get in, is appalling to me.\r\n\r\nMy daughter definitely likes ponies. What she thinks about free software remains to be seen. Tux paint is a hit, though, so there's hope!\r\n\r\nThe truth is that outcomes are the result of both 'nature' and 'nurture', as any decent biologist can tell you. It's even more twisted than that, as it is in our nature to nurture the genders differently. So, I think it's a bad idea to assume that if you eliminate nurturing biases that you will get equal results.\r\n\r\nOTOH, it's much more interesting to consider what the right sort of nurturing can bring to the field if it introduces people with a different nature to the same problems. And that's one reason why it makes sense to expend effort on promoting diversity even if it isn't necessarily the same as promoting fairness (e.g. that's one reason why it might be right for GNOME to 'unfairly' hold a certain number of seats exclusively for women).\r\n\r\nWhat we need is more free software with ponies in it!\r\n\r\n;-)\r\n"

Isn't this the kind of thing that Bridget is talking about? \r\n\r\n<cite>The gender issue will never go away until we all stop defining ourselves, and each other, based on rigid gender roles.</cite>.\r\n\r\nHow can we give any group an even break if we continue to distinguish them from others on criteria which may not be relevant to the project? If GNOME were not that bothered about gender then why ask? Perhaps next year they should just ask for entrants and dispense with the gender question altogether.\r\n\r\nIn some areas there is a greater balance - I work in the UK Voluntary (not-for-profit) sector where it's quite common to encounter female IT workers but even here there is still a higher proportion of male IT workers because the pool from which they are drawn has a higher proportion of men.\r\n\r\nI don't know whether the recent efforts to recruit more women into the IT Industry[1] and/or the FOSS Community[1] will succeed. I hope they do as there is an inbalance and that's not a good thing IMHO. As ever though, this is a mountain that needs to be scaled on both sides. There remains prejudice in the industry (just last year I was amazed when at a trade show I was handed a freebie by a scantily-clad woman who was clearly only there to attract men to the stand - despite the number of women delgates walking around) and there is also prejudice on the part of the women they are trying to attract.\r\n\r\n[1] I am not sure who or what these groups consist of or how they are defined. I don't even know if they do exist as such - so diverse are their alleged members - but I use the terms because they provide a common shorthand. This waffling footnote excepted of course :o)"

You don''t have to be female to be miserable in the rat race.  Women shouldn''t be comparing their experiences with those of the *BEST* experiences of men in the workplace, but rather with the average or even the worst.'

    body: "  The idea that gender differences fundamentally disadvantage both genders is an odd one.  To accept it, you have to accept the idea that gender differences actually disadvantage women to begin with and frankly, I don't even buy that.\r\n\r\n  The idea that gender is a social construction is frequently raised by the more androgynous members of both sexes and while I understand the advantage for them in making that suggestion, it doesn't mean for one moment I buy it.  And neither should you.\r\n\r\n  What you call 'stereotyping', I call categorisation.  Categorisation is a critical life-skill which allows rapid assessment of entities and there's nothing inherently wrong with it.  It's an artefact of the limitations of our conciousness more than anything else.\r\n\r\n> men are villified for doing things that are seen as Ã¢â‚¬Å“girl thingsÃ¢â‚¬?.\r\n\r\n  And so they should be.  A man's world is fundamentally different to a woman's and all the politically correct assertions to the contrary will not change that.  In both biological and sociological terms men are equipped with advantages for certain roles and abilities.  Nudging them away from those for the sake of trying to erase the gender divide is a fundamental betrayal of who they are.  It's a piece of sociological engineering for the sake of gain on the part of those who wish to see differences between the genders blurred or erased.\r\n\r\n  One of the main gender issues with IT is that it very much tends to be populated by men whose understanding of women is so poor their interaction with women both online and off is something of an embarassment.  As such, their interaction will usually fall somewhere between the twin poles of crudity on the one hand and pathetic fawning on the other.  To a certain extent that's changing and there are men who are socially adept but IT is not exactly swimming with them.\r\n\r\n> IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m just saying that we should all be big enough to not make mass generalisations. \r\n\r\n  Nonsense.  They're adults, they'll get over it.  This is not an issue which needs any kind of concerted effort.  The fundamentals are about men and women interacting, the IT issues are irrelevant.\r\n\r\n  Presuming that a good programmer I meet online is a guy isn't limiting me in any way.  It's a blase assumption brought on by experience and probability.  It's the same as women who presume that IT guys are generally socially inept and unlikely to make attractive boyfriends.  Brought on by experience and probability.  We're human, that's pretty much how our brains work.  Does it really matter?  Not to an adult.\r\n\r\n> The gender issue will never go away until we all stop defining ourselves, and each other, based on rigid gender roles. \r\n\r\n  I don't see a problem with that.  Really.  If you want to be an exception to the usual rules about your gender, be my guest.   Frankly though, trying to impose double-think on everyone merely to satisfy that need strikes me as a tad self-focused.  Gender influences so much of who we are that trying to erase it, nullify it, deny it or villify it is pointless."

    body: "Nature versus nurture is a moot discussion. There are a lot of opinions floating around, and everybody is entitled to their own. If a male programmer wants to believe he's a better programmer than I am simply because he's male, it's his right to believe it if he wants to, whether I agree with him or not.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I'm tired of feminist and anti-feminist discussion. Women in my field are not coddled, nor do I believe they are overly mistreated these days. The field of computers and programming, and likely almost all engineering fields in general, have ALWAYS been dominated by men. Most doctors are men. Most construction workers and fire rescue workers are men. I would even venture to say that even the majority of professional musicians are men. There are a LOT of fields that are dominated by men.\r\n\r\nI think we should be looking more at our roots, as a people. Way back when humans were primitive and living in small groups, men had roles and women had roles. Men hunted and fought, women cooked and tended house and children. Why? Because those methods of cooperation and that division of labor suited our nature.\r\n\r\nIf I was suddenly transported into the stone age, you had better be sure that I'd rather cook and tend babies than compete in hunting parties and instigate fights with other clans. We as humans lived that way for millions of years until a bunch of humans started working cooperatively to accomplish more, and thus the bronze age was born. That was only a few thousand years ago. Why shouldn't it be natural for women to have more of a maternal and social instinct and for men to be more agressive and more strongly muscled?\r\n\r\nOur society is changing so rapidly, it's no wonder that our insticts and traditions and culture are finding it hard to keep up. In our world today, jobs and roles are so much more complex than they were, who can truly say that one gender is better at some job than another? Who can truly know, when everything around us is so different from what it was just a few years ago, much less a thousand?\r\n\r\nYes, in general, men are are physically stronger than women. Yes, women are the ones who have babies. But the mental tendencies and capacities between men an women can only really be judged by neurologists, and I don't believe that science is advanced enough to say for sure who's better at what. I try not to judge anybody else except by their own individual tendencies and expectations for themselves, and my own tendencies led me to love computers.\r\n\r\nPeople who make rash and unsubstantiated statements about gender or race are fools who just want the attention that comes with saying things that tend to make people angry. Prove to me that all men in the world are better programmers than I am, and I'll believe anybody who says that women shouldn't be programmers."

    body: "No, asking for an applicant's gender is just collecting data. As far as I know, the information was not used in the evaluation process. You have to give this information to attend school or get a job, so why is it strange here?\r\n\r\nAnd why do you give this information? It's so that people can track trends like this and know when something has failed miserably to be an equal opportunity. If GNOME had received 180 applications from men and 10 from women, that would be a bit bleak, but plausibly represent no bias. But 181 applications, 100% male -- that means something is not working. For some reason, GNOME's normal application process does not attract women.\r\n\r\n'Why?' is a different question. There's many different levels at which this can be happening, from 'women never hear of it' to 'women don't want to be around geeky guys' and so on.\r\n\r\n'Who cares?' is a possible response. After all, it's not like \"free software developer\" is a common title for anyone of either gender, and the fact that it seems to appeal to a certain kind of male techie may not really matter all that much. There aren't a lot of female auto mechanics or garbage collectors, either.\r\n\r\nHowever, I find that I do care.\r\n\r\nI care in principle simply because I think people should be able attain their maximum potential, and I think there must be many women for whom free software development could be fulfilling. After all, it seems strange that women, who are generally much better at cooperating and sharing than men, should be left out of the party when it comes to shared software development.\r\n\r\nI care socially, because I'm a lot happier in co-ed environments. Men on their own act like pigs, frankly. I clearly can't really know first-hand what women on their own act like, but I hear tell that isn't good either. I think we're designed to work together, and communities with both genders are usually a lot more sane and friendly, in my opinion.\r\n\r\nI care technically, because diversity is always a benefit in any creative endeavor. I think women are fundamentally different than men, and that's a good thing -- fundamentally different people find fundamentally different solutions. There are some problems men alone will likely never even recognize, much less solve. That argument works for ethnic groups, too.\r\n\r\nFinally, we can ask 'what next?'  I don't know what the right thing to do is. I'm not sure why 200 women applied to a program when it was reserved for women, but wouldn't do so when it was (theoretically) genderless. Maybe they'd never heard of it, and all it took was the kind of press you get with a headline like \"Gnome Needs Women\". Or maybe, those women did see the call, but didn't think to apply without encouragement. Or maybe, they thought to and then thought better of it after their last experience on comp.lang.whatever.\r\n"
