In the US, the standard term for patents is now 20 years. I believe this applies to all forms of patents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI gather from what you say that patents may be as short as 7 years in some places. That, at least, would be some relief. There aren't a lot of technologies that legitimately need 20 years of patent protection, just as there aren't many copyrighted works that really need life + 80 year copyright protection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt's funny to think that when the US Constitution was written, both copyrights and patents were to be limited to 7 years of protection. Jefferson wanted to put a specific number like that in the text, but there was debate over what the exact number should be, and we wound up with \"limited terms\" which can mean anything.  Jefferson was afraid, in fact, of exactly what has happened, which is that Congress and lawyers have pushed the meaning of \"limited\" to a ridiculous extreme.  Now, the terms of \"limited\" copyrights are being compared to the practical legal definitions of \"unlimited\" real estate property laws!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnyway, seeing as we now have a genuine \"storyline\" patent application in the US (yes, I'm not talking about Stallman's satirical arguments, but a real application for a patent on a plot for a book), perhaps the absurdity of the system will finally break it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI fear, though, that we will not see a thorough dismantling of this decrepit system, but rather a patch job. For example, when the US regulations against exporting high-technology and \"arms\" were interpreted to inlude cryptographic software, the problem was not fixed by eliminating the underlying stupidity of the law, but by writing a new special exemption for \"exported software for which no fee is charged\". In other words, they took the absolute smallest step they could get away with.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI think that's the wrong attitude entirely. The more I look at this problem, the more it seems clear to me that we'd be better off to abolish ALL patents (hard and soft). The bureaucracy required to manage them is no longer worth the benefit received, and industry moves so much faster today that there just isn't need for legal protection -- ordinary market effects favor the originator of an idea anyway.  And since patent applications are so expensive, they only protect the big established companies who are least in need of protection. The little guy gets battered, and patents are just another weapon to do it with.  Despite conventional wisdom to the contrary, patents are a disaster for inventors and start up companies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr/>\r\n\r\n<strong>From</strong>: Marco \r\n<strong>Url</strong>: \r\n<strong>Date</strong>: 2005-11-10\r\n<strong>Subject:</strong> I wish you all the luck, Tony\r\n\r\n\r\nand I'm sure you will help in the battle against sw patents in the forecoming future with all your health and strengh, as I'm sure you have won the battle against cancer.\r\n\r\nForza Tony! ;)\r\n\r\n<hr/>\r\n\r\n<strong>From</strong>: Bob Goldstein \r\n<strong>Url</strong>: \r\n<strong>Date</strong>: 2005-11-10\r\n<strong>Subject:</strong> Baby in the Bath Water\r\n\r\n\r\nI have a real problem with patents, particularly software patents, when they are abused.  But do remember, patents can kill in several ways.  Not just in the sense you mean, where you can't get treatment because a patent makes it too expensive.  But what about patents that DIDN'T happen yet, because the patented invention hasn't been invented yet, because the guy with the idea figured he'd get ripped off by a deep-pockets company because patent protection is poor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLack of innovation can kill, too, but it's kinda hard to give specific examples :-)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAll I'm saying is, find the right balance.  Do you really think that 2 years is long enough to exploit an invention and reap a fair return for a risky investment?  If so, fine; if not, then reconsider.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm personally much more opposed to patents of fairly obvious things used for the purpose of inhibiting innovation, than I am of people with truly novel life-saving inventions getting wildly rich.\r\n\r\n<hr/>\r\n\r\n<strong>From</strong>: Cees de Groot \r\n<strong>Url</strong>: http://www.cdegroot.com\r\n<strong>Date</strong>: 2005-11-10\r\n<strong>Subject:</strong> A world without pharma patents? Not so sure...\r\n\r\n\r\nI worked a stint (3.5 years) at a pharmaceutical company. At the time, they were somewhere in the top 10 world-wide. My job was building software for the technical R&D department, where new active ingredients go from hardcore R&D (\"hey, this might just work\") to a product (\"here's your subscription\"). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe product we mainly worked on was some ingredient originally extracted from some fungus and which helped suppress immune reactions after transplantations. When I entered the project, the product was just released, at a cost of roughly half a billion euros to get it from \"hey this might just work\" to something that the FDA and other authorities were happy to release ot the market. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe *only* reason that this company plunged half a billion into that product was because they held a patent, and the patent would *just* cover a long enough period so they could get a decent return-on-investment. After that, the generics makers would certainly jump on the market and eat off any excess profit. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI live in the Netherlands, and I guess there's a good chance that your PET scanner comes from one of the few high-tech companies over here, Philips Medical Systems. Sure, they make a profit, but the amount of money they have to pour into R&D before they can make that profit is insane. Medical systems aren't easily released to the market (for very good reasons), so apart from all the regular run-off-the-mill high-tech R&D they also have to make sure they comply with a gazillion regulations, *proof* (rather than just assert) that the devices are safe and won't give false readings, etcetera. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYes, it has a backlash. Cutting-edge medical equipment tends to be very expensive. But without a system that would give these companies a save haven to get back their investment plus some return on investment, I fear that this sort of corporate R&D would halt. And I'm not sure that without companies doing the whole productizing (something you'll never see done by a university department, and rightly so), affordable PET scanners would arrive any sooner. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDisclaimer: I am very much against most software patents or indeed any of the ridiculous patents that are granted these days - but I have yet to come up, for some valid applications, with a better alternative. And, yes, I hate it that pharma companies don't adjust their prices in the third world and they're rightly chastised for it. \r\n\r\n<hr/>\r\n\r\n<strong>From</strong>: Arthur Marsh \r\n<strong>Url</strong>: http://www.users.on.net/~arthur.marsh/\r\n<strong>Date</strong>: 2005-11-11\r\n<strong>Subject:</strong> ...and the scanner used on me was made by...\r\n\r\n\r\nI recently visited the Emergency Department at Flinders Medical Centre (in Adelaide's southern suburbs) and had a CT scan which diagnosed a Meckel's Diverticulum which was threatening to burst, risking Peritonitis (http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000234.htm).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe CT scanner was made by Toshiba. I would like to think that Toshiba don't use the sale of such equipment so much as a cash cow but rather a public relations advertisement for their consumer goods.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPerhaps governments could guarantee a particular volume of sales at a particular price of such equipment in exchange for the patents being opened up quickly in the interest of further widespread development and lower costs?\r\n\r\n<hr/>\r\n\r\n<strong>From</strong>: Richard \r\n<strong>Url</strong>: \r\n<strong>Date</strong>: 2005-11-11\r\n<strong>Subject:</strong> Best of luck with the cancer\r\n\r\n\r\nSorry to hear about your cancer, but don't worry too much! Testicular has a huge cure rate, and recent developments have improved it even further. When I went through it 3 or 4 years ago about 50% were cured by the initial surgery, 90% of the remainder by the chemotherapy/radiotherapy, and after a clinical trail I was part of we got the survival rate for the remaining 5% of patients to 60%. More has been discovered since.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor most patients the disease can be tracked by detecting hormones in the blood. hopefuly they took as sample before surgery to see if this is the case for you. This beats the scans, and what's better the blood tests are easy to take and the results come back quickly, so unlike most other cancers testicular cancer patients get frequent up to date reports on their progress. The hormones will decay exponentially during treatment, so plot on a logarithmic graph against linear time if you're feeling technical.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHopefuly all that will be needed after the surgery is routine checkups for a few years. Even then, the chemotherapy isn't bad. You have the advantage of being relatively young which really helps (compare with your typical cancer patient in their later life). First week may seem odd, but after that you get used to it. Recovery tends to be quick and very complete. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBest of luck with the prognosis and any further treatment, if you need it.\r\n\r\n<hr/>\r\n\r\n<strong>From</strong>: Tim Pratt \r\n<strong>Url</strong>: \r\n<strong>Date</strong>: 2005-11-14\r\n<strong>Subject:</strong> Medical Patents Kill\r\n\r\n\r\nI read your comment with interest: certainly the headline got me to click through. Before we get into my observations, you should know that I am at once an RN with multiple advanced degrees, a business man in the business of providing clincial research support software (not patented BTW), and an erstwhile clincial researcher myself with a few publications to my name. Oh yeah, I'm also on about 8 patent apps for research software from another company I used to work for (that I won't realise a cent for). The bottom line is I bring a curious mix of knowledge from the professional fields covered by your piece.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHere's my observation: your closing arugment is simplistic and in very large part unrealistic. Question: why do medical patents expire after only 7 years, vs many many more for other fields and decades for copyright? Answer: so people can get ahold of them sooner and make their own devices utilising the technology. So, why do companies charge a lot during the patent protected period? Answer: because they have a very limited amount of time to recoup their R&D investment before it goes off patent. NOT as you allege, so executive's wives can go shopping! The developers of the patented technology are in almost every case answerable to shareholders who demand a return on thier investments. Who are the shareholders? That'd be you and me with our various retirement plans, stock portfolios etc. If these companies do not perform, execs get fired and the company goes out of business - not much technology development there. If the development of the technology is not profitable, guess what - new technology will not be developed!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHere's what I'd propose - a longer patent protection period! Full patent protection for 3 years, followed by graduated forced licensing that steps down over a subsequent 12 years and where said licensing cost on a per unit basis is tied directly to a % value of the initial cost to develop. Everyone gets happy - investors recoup costs and profit, technology becomes broadly distributed, developers get a guaranteed income stream, patients get access to cutting edge diagnosis and treatment faster.\r\n\r\n<hr/>\r\n\r\n<strong>From</strong>: Andre Caldas \r\n<strong>Url</strong>: \r\n<strong>Date</strong>: 2005-12-02\r\n<strong>Subject:</strong> Assumptions vs Facts\r\n\r\n\r\nDear friend!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou make some assumptions that maybe you should reconsider:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n* Patents is the only fair way to make money on the pharmaceutical industry.\r\n\r\n* Medication and treatment are expensive because of lack of 'protection'.\r\n\r\n* Every body gets happy!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThen you say that the author's closing argument is simplistic!? What makes your elaborated?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd you say that the author's closing argument is unrealistic!? What makes yours realistic?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso, you should consider that:\r\n\r\n* The pharmaceutical industry is one of the most profitable\r\n\r\n* The 'gold rush' happens just after some new technique comes out.

I might be inclined to allow for a shorter period for the holding of patents.  But short of a dictatorship, either left or right, you cannot create anything without for profit reasearch and development.  And without good R&D, people with cancer or any other illness, would be worse off!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYes, I like to dream too.  But we have to be realistic.\r\n\r\n<hr/>\r\n\r\n<strong>From</strong>: Tony Mobily  <b>(SUBSCRIBER!)</b>\r\n<strong>Url</strong>: http://www.mobily.com\r\n<strong>Date</strong>: 2005-12-23\r\n<strong>Subject:</strong> Re: patents kill\r\n\r\n\r\nHello,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis comment wins two prizes:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n* The most unsympathetic\r\n\r\n* The least informed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCongratulations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMerc.\r\n\r\n<hr/>\r\n\r\n"
