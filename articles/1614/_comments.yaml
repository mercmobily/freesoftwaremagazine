But it's kind of devolved into the no sense of humor, defensive, 'don't talk bad about my favorite program' crowd.\r\n\r\nI'm starting to realize that there's some real cultural conflicts here. Some people are extremely threatened by this kind of thing, and that's a bizarre phenomenon in itself.\r\n\r\nCan't wait to see what the next installments do. I know they're already in the pipe.\r\n\r\n;-)\r\n"

Still, I decided to give it a try and see where this went :)\r\n\r\nI'll probably report on the next installment(s) as well, but I'll try to give a bit more guidance for a discussion in the article. \r\n\r\nI agree that it'll be interesting to see what is going to happen.."

Best to avoid it. (And of course, there was the \"physically restrained from posting\" part. ;-) )."

"what in the sphincter hell is a normal", "what is a uv" etc. I''m glad I didn''t give up though and the whole subject of blendernizing just became more and more fascinating. I downloaded the package just to do some stars I needed for a background plate. Now Blender is my main squeeze at night. I just broke up with my video editor too now that Blender''s saying "I can do that you know" Good story Rosalyn, brings it all back. :-) ho ho ho'

I made a really ugly body looking thing. I''m glad I ran across this site!! I''ve played with blender on and off for a long time (I said played, I mean, downloaded, opened, got confused and uninstalled.) I''m now sticking too it and I''m going to learn the program even if it drives me crazy!'

    body: "Learning how to use Blender is obviously difficult. It took me about a month to fell confortable with the interface and a year to reach my primary goal: create a face with materials and textures. But I fell now that the pain was justified. Blender is a powerful programm with huge possibilities.\r\nMeanwhile, as a teacher attempting to learn the soft to young students, I think it would be a great step forward to elaborate a lighter version more ergonomic.\r\nIt is probably the most difficult thing to do: make something complex easy and simple to use and understand.\r\n"
