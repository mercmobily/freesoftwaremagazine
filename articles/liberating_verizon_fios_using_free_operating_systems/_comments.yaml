I installed all hardware and software myself with no problems.  There are 3 issues that make technicians believe you have to have a Mac or PC:\r\n\r\n1) DHCP: They don't provide static IPs to residential users.  Occasionally, they reassign your IP address with DHCP.  Apparently, most technicians don't know that it is a network standard.\r\n\r\n2) DNS: In Maryland, they are using MS Active Directory to provide dynamic DNS.  I simply found some alternate DNS servers and set my /etc/resolv.conf files to point at about 6 of them.  For my daughter's PC, I had to wade thru a dozen screens, but finally found the window that allows you to define 3 name servers.\r\n\r\n3) Email: Of course they want you to use all the bells and whistles from their site so they can ratchet up your bill, and some of those require MS ActiveX applications on your PC.  I have had to leave ActiveX enabled on my daughter's PC so we can get security updates (not so many, because most of her applications are FOSS), but I have specifically forbidden her to download any application that requires ActiveX.\r\n"

The install team had only about a month's experience doing installs.  I activated using the tech's supplied URI via my laptop and sandboxed their install process (try <a href=\"http://www.sandboxie.com\">Sandboxie</a>). I did not use their fancy ActionTec router.  I plugged the WAN side wire from my Linksys WRTG54 into the ONT and it came up fine.\r\n\r\nWish I had let them install their router, now I want to use some of its features and when I install it it won't grab an IP address.  Maybe it thinks it still has to do the PPOE thing.  Haven't tried tech support yet, but in all other respects love FiOS.\r\n\r\nStreamed a movie from Shoutcast TV @ 500m with no stutters or freezes - other than a bit of contrast banding due to compression it looked just as good as the DVD.  Glad to say goodbye to Adelphia, who were more reliable before Time-Warner took over but never have been rock solid, and has been more degraded as more people in my neighborhood hooked up and shared the bandwidth.\r\n\r\nVerizon thinks of itself as clever marketers and tries to shove a huge pile of largely useless software on the unsuspecting but you don't have to take any of it and can remove it if you change your mind.  It does offer a security suit based on the CA products apparently included in the price of service and loadable on all your computers (though it has a problem on my AMD 64 (Win-XP Pro 32) system).\r\n\r\nOh and their email is Yahoo! based, which if you already pay for as a Yahoo! customer causes some cookie-related grief as you try to switch among accounts.  I just decided to forward all Verizon mail to the original Yahoo! account and never go to their email.  They delete your email after 30 days if you don't download it, which is a worse deal than straight paid-for Yahoo! that lets you keep up to 2 gig indefinitely.  Verizon's websites suck too, very heavy on the flash and difficult to navigate (more sizzle, little steak).  And the FiOS site is just plain useless.  If they'd just stick to delivering bandwidth - that's all I want to pay them for.  They seem to be good at it - so far."

    body: "I just had FiOS installed here. When I called to place the order the Verizon salesperson asked me what operating systems I am using. I told him I use Linux. He said Linux will work fine there is no problem. I told him I do have XP available as well if needed.  2 days later the tech came in and installed it. He attached the ONT to the building, installed the phone service and then made up a few ethernet patch cords and ran them from the ONT to the basement where the Verizon supplied router was to be installed. I had it installed in the basement because that is where the ethernet cable terminates that runs to my upstairs hard wired network so it was the most conveniant spot. \r\n\r\nWhen trhe time came he plugged in the Verizon (Actiontec) wireless router and plugged the cat 5 leading to my upstairs network cable into one of several ports on the back of the router   I let him use my laptop as my  \"main computer\" via wireless connection to the router to perform the initial \"setup\". He told me he is more comfortable working via Windows so I booted it into XP for him. While he was doing that I ran upstairs  and fired up  my Linux box and noticed I immediately got an IP address from the Verizon router. A few small changes to the routing table via the \"route\" command and I was already connected via Linux. How bout that... I had my Linux box up and running and online on FiOS even before the tech downstairs had the Windows laptop online.\r\n\r\nThen I ran back down to the basement to join the VZ tech. The whole big \"setup\" of your main computer (that Verizon makes a fuss about when you talk to them on the phone) only involves establishing a connection to your router, logging into the Verizon website and having you chose a username and a password for your email/ customer account, i.e. billing, tech support,  etc. As far as the MSN and Yahoo software goes the tech didn't even bother installing it on the laptop. He said the  majority of customers opt not to have it installed,  besides you can download and install it on your own anytime. Before leaving he ran a speed test and we were getting slightly over 20 mbps download and 4 - 5  mbps upload. At that point his job was done. He cleaned up the empty router and cable boxes, wire insulation etc. Incidentally, throughout the whole installation process the VZ tech was very polite and accommodating in as far as setting things up whichever way I preferred and left me an abundant length of cable in the event I want  to move the connection elsewhere. Before he left he gave me some information packages about the service and the router and left.\r\n\r\nAt that point all that was left to do was some reconfiguration and rerouting of my local network. The Verizon wireless router is on the network  192.168.1.x and my local network is on 192.168.2.x I have my Linux box that operates as a server/router/firewall attached to the Verizon router. It  may sound a bit archaic to run my Linux router behind another router but it works fine, it's still blazing fast, and it gives me a bit of redundancy which can be helpful. .Plus I have 2 wireless access points, one upstairs on 192.168.2.x and downstairs on 192.168.1.x.  From what I understand  you can also bypass the Verizon supplied router and use other routers or, connect your Linux box directly via PPPoE but I haven't tried that  yet. \r\n\r\nIf you have been hesitating to get FiOS because of fears of Linux incompatibilities all I can say is ...relax.  Verizon is using standard protocols and it should easily  work with any common networking OS, i.e. Linux, Unix, Windows, mac, etc. Be nice to your tech, he is there to make  it work for you and probably appreciates the things he learns from different customers with diverse needs.\r\n\r\n"

    body: "Starting a business w/a home office in PA, just across the river from NJ.  I was supposed to have my personal dial-up line converted to a business line w/DSL. I was told it would work with my Mac OS and that DSL is available, even though FIOS is now available in my neighborhood. The day before the conversion, a Verizon Webtell modem arrived at my doorstep via UPS. Later that day, a Verizon Rep. called to say that because I can get FIOS, DSL is not available.  In order to use FIOS, I would have to upgrade to a newer version Mac OS as well.\r\n\r\nDoes this make any sense?  I can't get DSL because FIOS is here?  What about the DSL lines that already existed before FIOS?  Did they all get converted over?  Does anyone know anything about this?\r\n\r\nAlso, how can they cut the copper if I have two \"regular\" phone lines which are paired up on one piece of copper cable?  How complicated & expensive can this potentially get?\r\n\r\nI just want a faster connection w/o tying up the phone.  At this point, I'm thinking how much money Verizon is saving me by throwing a wrench in my plans, considering how much they charge for everything "

    hostname: 72.74.92.216
    created: '1166714321'
    body: "We have had Verizon FIOS internet (and telco) for a couple of months.  Just upgraded to FIOS TV.  No one at Verizon said that we would have to replace the WRT54 we were using.\r\n\r\nSo now this tall Actiontec 424WR is our connection to the internet.  I don't like that because it's slowed down ping times and takes about 10% off the upload speed (1.8Mbs instead 2.0Mbs in my case).  \r\n\r\nThe Verizon tech that did the Fios TV install was very sharp and answered my many questions.  Here's what I learned from him about how this set up works.\r\n\r\nThe ActionTec is used by Verizon TV to provide the real time TV Guide and services like OnDemand.  It does this by using part of the fiber bandwidth to get Guide Info from a Verizon website.  The ActionTec has a coax cable connection on the back and the Motorola set top boxes have an ip address.  The Actiontec passes Guide and OnDemand  requests to the Verizon site and relays responses to the requesting STB.\r\n\r\nWhat I don't like is having a Verizon controlled router between me and the internet.  Without being too paranoid, it's easy to see that the router could collect site visited information for marketing purposes.  It's virtually impossible to do that at a DNS without bogging it down, so what they've done is put an observatory in my home network.\r\n\r\nThe Verizon tech said that I could daisy chain the WRT54 underneath the Actiontec.  \r\n\r\nMy question is it possible to set my home net up with the WRT54 as the connection to the Verizon cat 5 to fiber link and put the Actiontec under the WRT?\r\n\r\nComments or suggestions much appreciated."

He also admitted he was not familiar with Linux but was very accommodating in letting me test the connection under Linux while he was there.\r\nHe didn't even bother installing the bundled junk an even told me that  many customers opt not to have it installed. \"Why waste the hard drive space if you're not gonna use it ?\" was his opinion. He did an A1 job getting me set up and neatly installing the ONT and all the gadgets. He told me he learns a great deal from the customers.  I was really impressed with the professionalism, accomodating atitude and courtest of the installation tech."

    body: "In all liklihood FIOS will be faster than DSL. What they do is replace the existing copper with fiber. Then they attach the ONT which converts the light signals to electrical signals. Part of the ONT is for the internet and connects to the router. The other part services your existing phone connection. If you have multiple lines (i.e. multiple numbers) they will operate through the same fiber cable. No longer a need to string an extra cable for each number. All you should wind up paying for is the FIOS internet. Your existing phone service, billing rates, etc should stay the same. The only difference is that it will be going out over Fiber instead of copper. Of course you will have a very fast Internet connection and be able to use your phone simultaneously.\r\n\r\nOf course talk to your Verizon representative to get the final word on billing, how much it will cost, how you'll be billed,etc. \r\n\r\nAs far as having to upgrade that is probably to accomodate the bundled software they give you. You might be able  to opt for them not to install it. FIOS works fine with Windows, Linux, and MacOS. You should have no problems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It was a mess because Verizon assumed that we \"knew\" we had FIOS. They kept trying to sell me expensive services and couldn't understand why I didn't want them.\r\n\r\nAnyway, we don't own a business, only want the cheapest services, have always used satellite for TV, and are perfectly happy with dial-up Internet. My view is that exchanging expensive copper for cheap optical fiber is a gyp!  I feel we were screwed by the tenants.  The property manager still has their deposit so we are wondering if we should insist that the tenants have the copper cable put back. Any thoughts?  "

Just use a different subnet range for the WRTG (perhaps 192.168.2.x) so that you can still access the other router by it's local address (192.168.1.1 by default) if you need to.  I think you could also use the dyndns service in the WRTG (or OpenRT) even behind the Verizon router, since that simply looks at the final public appearing address.  You will want to disable the wireless on the Verizon router, of course.  This can be done directly from it's html UI.\r\n\r\nIn theory you could use the WRTG in place of the Verizon router, at least if your not using their video services.  The Verizon router uses ppoe, so you would only need to know the password they set for ppoe.  Rather amusingly, it looks like the user id is a default user id (and hence also password) that they likely use on all their routers.\r\n"
