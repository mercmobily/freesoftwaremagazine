    body: "Hey Ryan,\r\n\r\nthanks for your post, maybe I forgot that, will try to really publish and not only preview my comments...\r\nAnyway, my problem with Firefogg is still the same, I select a video to be transcoded, and then just nothing happens. I tried several files with different codecs, all to no avail. I tried in a new Firefox window instead of a tab, still nothing happens after I select a file. I am using Firefox 3.6.3, and Firefogg 1.1.3. Windows XP. \r\nIs there anything that springs to your minds? \r\nThank you.\r\nMecho"
