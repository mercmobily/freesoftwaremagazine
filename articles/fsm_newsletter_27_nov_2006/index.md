Welcome to another of Free Software Magazine’s fortnightly newsletters, keeping you up to date with us, and all things free software... enjoy!


# General announcements

We had no idea just how talented our audience was—not to mention that many of you want to write for us! We asked for bloggers, and bloggers we got! We have had a fantastic response to the blogger competition so far—there are so many excellent entries to choose from. We’ll be announcing our winners next fortnight, but we already have some new names on the site who were just too good for us to keep from you! If you still haven’t entered and plan to, you better get in quick as there’s not much time before we close off the competition. A big thanks to our community for their involvement and we hope you enjoy our new talent.

# Poll Results—Now that the ink is dry, how long do you think Microsoft will wait to start suing free software developers and companies?

This fortnight’s poll was asking how long you thought it would be before Microsoft starts suing and the results were really interesting—the two highest results were 30% with “six months to a year” closely followed by 25% with “never”. “One to five years” was next with 18%, followed by “one month or less” and “one month to six months” both on 16%. The lowest result was “over five years” with a mere 3% of the vote. Your comments showed that, essentially, the belief is that, if Microsoft sue at all, they'll do it just to prove a point and will probably target those who can’t afford to defend themselves. It doesn’t make them look good... they sure aren’t going on our Christmas list! Read more [here](http://www.freesoftwaremagazine.com/node/1869) and stay tuned for...


# This fortnight’s poll

[What's your distro of choice?](http://www.freesoftwaremagazine.com/node/1904l)

We decided that it would be interesting and useful to see what distros our readers use. Sorry if your distro is not shown... you know we can't show them all. We have listed the top ten distros from [DistroWatch.com](http://www.distrowatch.com) in no particular order. We may use this info to decide on what distros to focus on for future issues and articles.


# Reminders

**Comments**

Your comments on articles, issues, and blog entries are very welcome. They provide other readers with insightful suggestions, further information, and the feeling that they are not alone. They also provide our authors with the feeling that they are being heard.

**Avatars**

Avatars are a great way of expressing your personal identity, whether it be a photo or an image that you feel represents the you you want to be. Read more about avatars [here](http://www.freesoftwaremagazine.com/node/1713). To add an avatar: log in, go to “my account” in the menu on the left, go to the “edit” tab and scroll down to where it says “Upload picture”. Now, hit the browse button, find the image on your computer that you want to upload and go to the bottom of the page and hit the submit button. That’s it; you now have an avatar image.
