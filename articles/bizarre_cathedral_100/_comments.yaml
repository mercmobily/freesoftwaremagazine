    body: "Folks, I love this strip, and have signed up to FS Magazine mainly on the strength of it.  In reading through the entire archive of strips, though, I noticed about strip 90 that only a link for \"Previous strip\" was present instead of previous and next.  It made it more \"interesting\" to get through the last ten while I was catching up.\r\n\r\nI love the latest character (the rabbit Ubuntu girl), and I especially like the way she thinks, but sooner or later Mutt just has to pay her back for the multiple indignities she has hit him with lately.\r\n\r\nI'm going to follow you on Google+ 'cause I don't do Facebook.  Here's hoping the next hundred strips are as funny as these first hundred have been."
