At least the FSF Associate member USB key has a copy of it, but I don't know the detail of setting it up portably.\r\n\r\nAnd Opera is portable when you unselect \"use 1 profile for each user\" in the installer, and install it straight on the key."

It's a great replacement for notepad, has tabs and what not, but also does syntax highlighting for a lot of languages.\r\nThanks very much, this is great!\r\n------\r\nlet's all play nice!"
