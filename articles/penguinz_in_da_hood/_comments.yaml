It's a shame the FOSS community doesn't care more about marketing...\r\n\r\nI lately read 'In the Beginning was the Command Line' (should've read it long before), and it says really a whole lot about why the mind-share of GNU/Linux in the general public is that low. It's all about feelings. When people buy Windows or Macs they think they're getting something for their money. How could Linux be worth just a damn? We have to get the people value the freedom they would get - somehow. \r\n\r\nWhy not make a computer animated film with penguins, gnus, leopards (OS X) and some strange windows hanging around in the landscape! ;-)"

I've been working toward setting up a non-profit that gets re-conditioned computers to low-income families.  We don't do Windows because GNU/Linux simply makes much more sense.\r\n\r\nI have, however, found some issues for which I hope I could get some suggestions.  What I see is that most kids are interested in being able to use their computers to play games that are comparable to Playstation, XBox, etc.  I'm not sure how to get Ubuntu/Edubuntu to do that.  Additionally, many of them seem to be particularly interested in watching music videos from sites like http://music.yahoo.com just as easily as they can using Windows or a Macintosh.  I've personally used greasemonkey, pklaunch, and mplayer with some success, but it doesn't seem to work with the latest Ubuntu/Edubuntu (6.10)."

Quite a bit cheaper than $25M and using a lot less airconditioning and energy. The PS3 is greener.\r\n\r\nThe other area the Cell is useful to Linux hackers is audio visual recognition and response. Part of the holy grail of a really useful user interface. An Open Grid of PS3s can process large AI data domains, even over a broadband network.\r\n\r\nCouple all this with existing Linux daemons and tools and the money you spend on your PS3 can become the interface to an intelligent computing slave instead of saving your money on outdated technology dumb PCs."

Any marketing initiative will need funding. And any marketing initiative on even a medium scale - e.g. giving away \"Live\" CDs of «YOUR_FAV_DISTRO» - needs, money, people and coordination.\r\n\r\nThere used to be an ad on UK TV last year from IBM talking about Linux taking over and being the next big thing. That ad has now disappeared.\r\n\r\nIt is things like that ad, Live CD give-aways, local events and demos at local PC shows and such that can spread awareness about freedom of software choice, the problems that software vendor lock-in poses, and how FOSS software addresses these issues.\r\n\r\nSo, despite the technological prowess demonstrated by the PS/3, GNU/Linux being embedded and therefore invisible to the average end-user does not achieve any increased awareness among average people about software freedom of choice. In other words, the PS/3 will perhaps be a great dual-boot platform for gaming and running GNU/Linux services for the GNU/Linux enthusiast. For the average gaming enthusiast, this will mean nothing and they will happily plug on with PS/3 games."

There are many factors that have led to this reality, but I don't want to go into that here.\r\n\r\nIt just seems to me that if the FOSS community can push GNU/Linux in South Africa, India, China, and many other countries, where there are lots of \"poor\" people, somethings terribly wrong if it can't be pushed similarly here in the Bronx, in Compton, and everywhere in between.\r\n\r\nWhat schools can use (in the USA) is determined by  Federal, State, and local governments who all too often are corrupted by kick-backs & other such questionable money deals.  Perhaps we need to find a way to get kids & their parents some GNU/Linux exposure.  My hope is that upon experiencing it, they will ask for it by name in schools and elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe Tenant Association office in my housing complex has some computers available for tenants to use. They are about 8 Internet connected PCs running MS Windows.  The \"TA\" President does all the maintenance and support for those PCs.  He seems fairly \"set in his ways\", so getting him to change his mind could be a daunting task.  Perhaps I could find a decent used PC, install & configure GNU/Linux, and give it to them.  I could offer to help him to do whatever support he needs.\r\n\r\nSuggestions are welcome."

    hostname: 68.93.224.4
    created: '1165421253'
    body: "I knew this topic was in danger of going downhill, simply because of the (potentially? apparently?) condescending usage of \"da hood\".\r\n\r\nYour statement follows a couple of common logical fallacies. The dismissively racist and classist overtones, which essentially resolve to a claim that the plight of the poor is their own fault (an all-too-common excuse for middle-class Americans to ignore social problems) are among them, but I don't think much is served by doing more than noting them. I'll just point out that you are almost always about to make a really stupid mistake when you let these prejudices guide your thinking.\r\n\r\nThe most egregious error, however, is the \"one bad apple\" theory. You speak of neighborhoods \"destroyed\" by \"those that now occupy them\". This is perhaps referring to crime rates. In any real population, including even the worst neighborhoods in America, \"law-abiding citizens\" out-number \"criminals\" by a considerable margin.\r\n\r\nCrimes are perpetrated by a usually tiny minority which is disproportionately visible. Reacting against the whole population is therefore a highly inefficient response. You are mostly punishing innocent people when you do that, which only serves to further destabilize the situation. Many of America's urban and race problems are directly attributable to authorities also making this mistake. This is why many honest poor people in the US regard the police as an occupying army to be avoided. This kind of response only increases class polarization and increases the risk of violence for everyone involved (even the rich who misguidedly called for \"more police\" and a \"hard on crime\" policy, even though those will actually exacerbate the problem in most cases).\r\n\r\nTarring all of the low-income inhabitants of a neighborhood with the same brush is not only unethical, but it is also inaccurate. You will draw many false conclusions by doing that. One of them is this idea that \"knowledge and education\" are \"looked at as a weakness\". Sorry, but that just isn't true for many honest low-income families of whatever ethnicity. Providing opportunities for those who will take advantage of them provides a means for those honest citizens to \"take back\" their communities.\r\n\r\nWhat <em>is</em> true is that poor families (or individuals) in such neighborhoods are in a constant state of crisis. Their fight-or-flight reflex is operating at a constant low-idle, and it <em>does</em> interfere with rational decision-making. In a FoF state, the mind drops long term goals in order to focus on immediate crisis. This is usually the right thing to do when FoF is actually a point-like event as it is meant to be in nature. However, constant fear of authorities, landlords, police, crime,  and racist/classist attitudes like ones expressed above, contributes to a sustained FoF response which becomes endemic. It's even taught to children by example and sometimes explicit instruction. Kids are taught not to care about \"non-essentials\" and that they can't trust authorities or mainstream society's values and ideas of \"education\".\r\n\r\nGetting these people to <em>trust</em> that— 1) you actually understand their problems, so are capable of formulating sane responses to them, 2) that you <em>care</em> about their success and not some hidden agenda (i.e. you're not going to stab them in the back as so many have before you), and 3) that you actually have the resources to back up what you are promising — is <em>extremely</em> difficult. These people believe that \"education\" of the kind that the society has been trying to push on them is a \"weakness\", because <em>it is</em>. Most of the \"educational\" programs pushed on these people are simply programs designed to control them for the benefit of the wealthy, not to genuinely help them.\r\n\r\nMuch more constructive approaches do exist for urban-renewal. Community watch organizations (and community-based policing in general), church or non-profit programs for education, and business start-up help are often more positive. In fact, it is through these latter initiatives that GNU/Linux advocacy could actually be useful. You have to work with people the community will <em>trust</em>. Ultimately, change comes from within, it can't be imposed from without. If you want to see improvement, however, then you can help by contributing resources to the insiders who are trying to improve their communities. In America, this generally means working with church groups, and sometimes inter-denominational alliances of church groups.\r\n\r\nBe aware, however, that on the scale of the problems these groups face, the licensing of their software is small potatoes. You have to demonstrate that there is a real benefit to be gained by using free software. And be prepared to be turned down a lot. A lot of folks are just going to stick to what they know. It's only after there are real examples to point to of people using free software to make real strides forward that usage will take off.\r\n"

(Mumtaz!)\r\n\r\nHowever... the usual trap has been sprung, and I think you need to escape!\r\nLet me explain: \"Why doesn't [insert_person_or_organisation] do something about ...\"\r\nHaven't you heard of viral marketing? It's the latest BIG THING buzzword fest getting capitalists salivating. It is also the basis for YouTube success (and others)\r\n\r\nViral marketing may be considered a new thing, but all it really means is that \"ordinary people\" become carriers of the product marketing, and infect their friends through word of mouth.\r\nThis is cheap, and it relies on grass roots interaction with people, enthusiasm and a good product to capture people's imagination: things we already have.\r\n\r\nSome thinking still needs to be done, i'm not advocating a \"lock'n'load\" attitude, but if you are crying over opportunities missed by others, then please look closer to home, your tears will sting! You live in a community. That community has needs, grinding poverty, low esteem, poor access to information and knowledge, and even a disdain for any highminded values that interfere with \"keeping it real\" and making money. In other words, they are people waiting for someone to reach out their hand to them, guide them and help them and educate them.\r\n\r\nIs there a Bronx LUG? If not, then maybe now is the time to set one up. If there is, then I am sure you are an active member, yes?(swap BRONX for your local deprived area).\r\n\r\nThe \"thinking\" I mentioned earlier would revolve around a few things:\r\n1) What is the \"HOOK\": What aspect of GNU/Linux/FOSS will be the killer feature that excites the community you wish to target? Sorry for stereotyping, but maybe it's the audio authoring capabilities of Jack, Rosegarden, Audacity, Ardour et al (a cheap way of building your own MIDI studio) that would excite some people in \"da hood\", and get them talking about Linux, and giving disks to their friends (I'm sorry, but music and sports are still considered the best means to escape from ghetto poverty). Maybe there are other \"killer apps'\" that would excite these people, but I wouldn't know (and neither would you) without talking to them and discovering their needs.\r\n\r\nRepetative marketing and naked ladies is the means used to create the feeling of a need in people, and make them desire a product. You don't have the money or the ethics for that, so instead you need to talk to them to find out what is their real need is, then try to provide a solution according to your means.\r\n\r\n2) How do you meet the people and disseminate your ideas to them effectively? Through the LUG? To your freinds only? Go to community centres? give handouts on the street? (sounds dangerous and unproductive if you don't \"make a connection\" with the people.)\r\n\r\nokay, I've definately gone on enough! Just one small(ish) point, then I'll quit.\r\nWhile it is natural for knowledgeable people to be enthusiastic about open source, and motivated by the ethics and ideology, it is not a natural selling point for most people. What they want is a way to solve a problem that they are living with, and you need to prove your solution is good and effective (and accessible)-the \"killer app/feature\". Once they have bought this solution (embodied in GNU/Linux), then you can indoctrinate them why FOSS is better than proprietary, because they are already taking that medicine, and they are committed to it.\r\n"
