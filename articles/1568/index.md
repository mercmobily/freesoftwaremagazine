<p>Those familiar with the world of torrents may be disappointed today to hear that <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/05/31/piratebay_raid/">Pirate Bay</a> has been raided by some 50 Swedish police. While it's certainly not unusual for torrent sites hosting links to copyrighted-data to get this treatment, I am a bit surprised that it would happen in Sweden, especially on this draconian of a scale. At any rate, though, apparently the news isn't totally bleak -- the Swedish <a href="http://www2.piratpartiet.se/">Pirate Party</a> is using the event to spur support for its movement to decrease the scope and reach of international copyright law.</p>
