    body: "Business has long relied on a certain amount of laxity in law-enforcement. A great deal of what goes on as an essential component of business (and innovation in general) is technically illegal.\r\n\r\nThat laxity allows stricter laws to be enforced, and selective enforcement, combined with the high cost of justice, means that most individuals (and therefore most potential new enterprises, as well) don't get to play by the same rules as the rest of the commercial world. It creates a double standard.\r\n\r\nIf copyrights and patents were ever to be STRICTLY enforced, business would probably grind to a halt in a matter of hours.\r\n\r\nThen, maybe we'd be seriously considering changing the laws to something like sanity. And then, a lot more people would appreciate what the freedom of a free-licensed piece of software is all about.\r\n"
