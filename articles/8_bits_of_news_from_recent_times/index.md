  There's been plenty of good news in the last few weeks.  Not enough  to write full blog entries on, but here's a list, newest first:


*   2007-03-05: [Free  software is nothing to fear](http://www.computerworld.com.au/index.php/id;1774276372) (about the term)
*   2007-03-02: [The Fedora GNU+Linux  distro looks to be moving closer to being fully free software](http://www.osdir.com/Article9761.phtml) -  following the lead  of [gNewSense](http://www.gnewsense.org/).
*   2007-02-28: [Videos from FOSDEM  2007 are already online](http://ftp.belnet.be/mirrors/FOSDEM/2007/) (to work out who the speakers are, see  [the programme](http://fosdem.org/2007/schedule/days).  Our Georg Greve gave the closing  keynote [Beyond  GPLv3](http://ftp.belnet.be/mirrors/FOSDEM/2007/FOSDEM2007-BeyondGPLv3.ogg).
*   2007-02-27: [Videos of November 2006's  GPLv3 conference have gone online](http://gplv3.fsij.org/#Resources) - there's a great selection  here, half of which are status reports of free software in general,  rather than being about GPLv3.  Two good examples are Alexandre  Oliva's and Nagarjuna G.'s talks about free software in Latin  America and in India, respectively.
*   2007-02-25: [Interview  with Shane Coughlan of FSFE's Freedom Task Force, by Sean Daly](http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20070225174152212), Shane has also done podcasts with [livemink](http://mediacast.sun.com/share/webmink/Shane%20Coughlan.ogg), and [ChaosRadio](http://chaosradio.ccc.de/archive/chaosradio_international_013.mp3).
*   2007-02-17: [Stallman  convinces Cuban government to move to free software](http://www.commercialappeal.com/mca/business/article/0,1426,MCA_440_5358169,00.html)
*   2007-02-12: [Although  delayed, draft 3 of GPLv3 seems to be coming Real Soon Now](http://news.com.com/GPL+3+release+could+slip+past+March/2100-7344_3-6158453.html)
*   2006-12-13: [Stallman  convinces newly-elected President of Ecuador to move the government  to free software](http://rudd-o.com/archives/2006/12/13/%c2%a1success-for-free-software-in-latin-america/)

Update: And I should also mention that I've gotten [fsfe.org/transcripts](http://fsfe.org/transcripts) online with 33 transcripts so far of presentations on free software and how it interacts with software patents, software licences, and copyright.
