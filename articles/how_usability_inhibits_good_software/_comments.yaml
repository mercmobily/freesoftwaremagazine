    body: 'In the fourth paragraph, you seem to have a distinction between free software and commercial software. I assume you meant free as in speech software, as the article is on this site, so I''d expect you mean non-free, or proprietary software instead of ''commercial'' software. Commercial free software can exist, and a fair amount of it does.'

    body: 'I did mean commercial software; I perceive that commercial software easily suffers from marketing expectations and executive meddling, which will result in feature creep.  I did not make the distinction between free and "freeware/no-nags" as I felt that I was specific in my comparison between FOSS and a commercial package.'
