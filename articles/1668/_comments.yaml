    body: "Or \"make sure you know where the knife hand is\".  I think the thing that bothers me most about Microsoft's recent overtures (like the ODF converter) is that it seems a little too good to be true that Microsoft could do anything without the intent to harm.\r\n\r\nI want to \"give the devil his due\" and respect what they're doing for what it is, but the company has such a track record of dirty-dealing and underhanded, below-the-belt tricks, that's it's just too hard to take them seriously when they decide to go \"open source\" as they claim to be doing with the ODF plugin.\r\n\r\nThere are of course, legitimate competitive explanations. The Open Document Foundation (also \"ODF\", let's call them \"ODFn\") plugin is not released yet, is subject to NDAs to see it at present, and so is not really following the open source \"rules\". Thus Microsoft, by announcing an open source effort is actually able to undercut the ODFn position by being \"more open source friendly\" with their plugin. It's a pretty big PR coup.\r\n\r\nIf you read the press release, of course, it's also an amusing FUD opportunity, as they have taken every opportunity to slam ODF as a less-capable, inferior standard to their own MSOOXML standard. Whenever they do tout the benefits of ODF, they avoid it by actually touting the benefits of \"XML standards\" (which would, theoretically, include both).\r\n\r\nThen there's the scary Microsoft/Creative Commons tool (what a bizarre alliance that is). The license is a standard EULA with all the baggage that carries -- but then, if you're already using Microsoft Word to create document, you've already agreed to substantially the same EULA.\r\n\r\nAll of that seems pretty toothless to me. There may be a knife, but neither of those can be it.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Microsoft could just be looking for a way out. They can't afford to lose face or back down, so they have to make whatever position they take look like victory. They have to make us think they invented \"open source\", just like all the other technologies they \"introduced\" (i.e. appropriated).\r\n\r\nI've even considered the possibility that ODFn intentionally left this opening for Microsoft. After all, you should always give a powerful enemy somewhere to go besides right over you! By leaving such an obvious opening, they may be trying to channel Microsoft into a sane course of action while making them think they invented the idea (or, if you want to be more devious, with the actual cooperation of Microsoft to make <em>us</em> think that Microsoft originated the idea!).\r\n\r\nBut I'm probably overestimating somebody's strategic abilities. Anyway, whatever the motivations, Microsoft seems to be sincere about the open source plugin: they've sited the project at Sourceforge rather than trying to retain in-house control over it, they've picked a standard, GPL-compatible, OSI-compliant, non-copyleft license (modified BSD). You know they wouldn't want a copyleft license, of course -- but that's hardly sufficient cause for concern. It could be that they have learned through experience that this is the only way such a project could be taken seriously.\r\n\r\nAt this point, the only place for the knife to be hiding is in software patents (but that's a pretty big hiding place).  But they've held that threat for a long time. So it may be that Microsoft really is in retreat, and is doing no more than PR damage control. Maybe there is no real \"knife\".\r\n"
