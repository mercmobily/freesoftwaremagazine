    body: "Thanks for a great article.\r\n\r\nHowever, changes in the licensing of ghostscript don't really affect it -- ghostscript has had a very capable GPL version which has included PDF support for at least a few years now, and there have been a number of GPL-free tools for making PDF as well.\r\n\r\nGhostscript was one of a few free GPL packages which was developed under a conventional commercial model, but used the free-licensing of the prior version as a way of promoting the new version.  This has kept GPL versions of ghostscript available for years.\r\n"
