But, then, I'm rarely booting in a crowded room.  ;-)\r\n\r\nMost of the time I want to know if KNOPPIX configured the sound on the system in question and the voice file confirms it to me.  When I am demonstrating KNOPPIX, the sound adds to the impression of the completeness of the Linux system.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, use the laptop's sound buttons to mute the audio output.\r\n"

    body: 'You are assuming of course there is one, and that it works.  The sound is played BEFORE the desktop environment is actually started, so if there is special audio keys that are recognized in the desktop environment rather than in the bios, they will not be processed until after the sound is already playing.  Rather subdued is also relative; try it on a laptop with rather large speakers.  Since I do not boot Knoppix except to recover a damaged filesystem (extremely rare of course) or otherwise prep a laptop for free software use, I personally do not care that much about the issue, but I would find it very annoying under most conditions, and it gives me a good idea of how annoying and frustrating using a system (like Vista) where you can never disable startup sounds would likely be.'

Unlike MS Vista( a distant view )."
