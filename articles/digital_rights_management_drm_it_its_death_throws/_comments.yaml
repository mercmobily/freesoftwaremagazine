    body: "> Finally, in our time, Gemstarâ€™s video recording system was a clever algorithm which could only remain secure provided it was not used.\r\n\r\nI'm intrigued by the idea that Gemstar's code was ever intended to be secure and for what purpose. As such isn't it possible the analogy with DRM is a little weak?\r\n\r\nIt's also likely that Canute/Knut/Knud the Great didn't actually drown. It's very open to interpretation as to whether he really attempted to hold back the tide but the legend generally says he did so to [disprove his fawning courtiers claims about his greatness](http://www.viking.no/e/people/e-knud.htm).  But there is perhaps an analogy there between the promoters of DRM and the Canute's courtiers -- both making false claims to further their own position. Fools and their delusions of grandeur eh?\r\n\r\nNow onto the subject at hand.. great introductory piece. DRM is one of the most oppressive attacks on modern culture. For me DRM is right up/down there with burning books.\r\n\r\ncheers  \r\nRyan"

Serves me right for posting in the middle of the night I suppose.\r\n\r\ncheers  \r\nRyan"
