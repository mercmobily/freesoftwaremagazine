    body: "You said, \"People don’t stop using GNU/Linux just because they can’t get their MP3 collection to play.\"\r\n\r\nI second that, although maybe in a different sense than you intended. I am currently writing this from a GNU/Linux PC without 3D acceleration. There's a proprietary driver, but I chose not to install it, even though no educational pop-up warning helped me make this decision. (What do these pop-up warnings say? \"Give up freedom. Are you sure? Yes. No.\")\r\n\r\nAnd indeed, I don't stop using GNU/Linux just because I can't get (free) 3D acceleration, or Quicktime, or BBC 4, ...\r\n\r\nI, for one, doubt the educational value of a message like, \"Proprietary software is bad! Now click OK and enjoy your Flash video! (This message was brought to you by Macromedia.)\"\r\n\r\n(Yes, a counter-argument can be made, as you did, but I don't consider it my job to deliver it, just as I think it's not a job for free software to make using proprietary software more convenient.)\r\n"
