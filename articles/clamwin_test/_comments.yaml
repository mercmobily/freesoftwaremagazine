Running this on server 2003, RAID array size = 240GB and it takes about 90 minutes to scan that.\r\n\r\n<hr/>\r\n\r\n<strong>From</strong>: Clif Brown \r\n<strong>Url</strong>: \r\n<strong>Date</strong>: 2005-10-08\r\n<strong>Subject:</strong> Clamwin\r\n\r\n\r\nI read the review of Clamwin and there is only a hint of something people should know: this program takes a long time to do a scan. On my 40 mB drive, several hours are required and there is no progress bar to tell you how far along the process has gone. I find that the only practical way to scan is to start Clamwin and let it run overnight.\r\n\r\n<hr/>\r\n\r\n<strong>From</strong>: Alex \r\n<strong>Url</strong>: \r\n<strong>Date</strong>: 2005-10-09\r\n<strong>Subject:</strong> Scan Speed\r\n\r\n\r\nMy 80 GB harddisk was scanned in less then one hour.\r\n\r\nI like this program.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlex\r\n\r\n<hr/>\r\n\r\n<strong>From</strong>: Alex R \r\n<strong>Url</strong>: \r\n<strong>Date</strong>: 2005-10-10\r\n<strong>Subject:</strong> ClamWin\r\n\r\n\r\nI noticed that my email provider was using Clam's serverside anti-virus and was pleased to find that Clam did the Clam Win Windows version.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI used to use Norton, but found it very heavy on system resources and was looking for an alternative, but I was prepared to pay if necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nClamWin installed without a hitch and uses very few system resources, making it idea for older or low ram systems in my opinion.  The fact that it is free is an added benefit, but does not detract from the functioning of the program in any way.  Updates are frequent and download without problem, although my XP system causes a small problem when it wakes up from standby and ClamWin initiates the update process when Windows is still not fully 'awake'. A manual update sorts out the problem - and there is a warning message so you know when something is not right.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe only weaknesses are the absence of an on-demand scanner, although this is not a great problem seeing as I always scan any downloaded files before opening them.  And the fact that it is a wee bit slow - but I guess this is the price you pay for low system resource usage and a low level of system integration. Leaving it running overnight is the answer, but I imagine newer versions will get faster in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAll in all it is an excellent utility and the Outlook integration and forthcoming Firefox plugins will add yet more value to it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA replacement for proprietary AV software?

I did am \"MSCONFIG\" and removed many of the startup programs it helped a little but got worst over time. I downloaded clamwin and removed Norton from my startup, It was scary how fast it booted up. I scanned my computer with clamwin and found 5 infected items that Norton had not recognized and I had just done a full scan about a week ago. The only drawback I see with Clam win is that it does scan a little slow but Norton’s was not extremely fast, as a write posted early I will just scan while I am sleep.\r\n"

    body: " I'm more then a average computer user as I have been building\r\nthem for almost 25 years. Over the years I have used about every virus scanner available and too many to mention all of them here. Norton & McAfee are bloated resource HOGS. They will slow your system down on boot and if your on dial up downloaded updates take forever. If you think Clam win is\r\nslow, count all your boot time and updates for just the two\r\nmain lines and you will find out you are way ahead. Disregarding  how long you wait for other programs to load\r\nbecause they have grabbed all your overhead available ram.\r\nHow many times have you also had to reboot because of a program lock up when trying to run it with Norton or McAfee\r\ninstalled. I pick on just them as they are the most likely to be purchased (DUE TO NET & COMMERCIAL ADVERTISEMENT HYPE) but other background scanners that run with your system result in the same truth! My opinion is AVOID THEM & THE\r\nHYPE! I use scan on demand for this very reason. I think\r\nall virus scanners should be this way. Now, don't get me\r\nwrong. They are GOOD products and work well for people who know NOTHING MUCH about computers. Reason being they don't have to worry about updating as its automatic and protection\r\nis automatic. You just pay for non-ability to do the updates and scanning yourself. I have tested Clam win against the\r\ntop 10 scanners and have found that Clam rates as high or high then they do. Encryption, Root Kit Virus and Trojans are the new wave. They are very hard to detect by ANY virus scanner. Due to the encryption methods and placement used.\r\n Something to remember however about Clam win even though\r\nit's a better then average scanner. It says it has Outlook\r\nintegration. This is ONLY for the Outlook that comes with\r\nMicro$oft Office. Outlook Express is NOT supported yet. I have written Clam to ask them why they decided to support\r\nOutlook and not Outlook Express which most Windows users are going to only have Express as a mail client. (Didn't Understand That One. That's Like Building A Car That Only\r\nPeople With Freckles Can Drive?) Anyway, best way to handle\r\nmail virus is to NOT POP (download) messages from your ISP\r\nor mail service. Go to the service and review your mail online. Don't download it to your computer when you have no idea whats in it. Thats like opening the door and invite\r\nsomeone in before finding out who they are and the intent.\r\nI've been using Clam win for years and it's proven to be a\r\nbrick wall. \r\n\r\n[...]\r\n\r\nThis is the way to turn your system back to it's original\r\noperation with no LAG and still have all the protection you\r\nyou would get with the HOG's! Hope this helps you recover\r\nthe pleasure of operation you deserve. Enjoy!\r\n\r\nAnonymous visitor @ Memphis Tennessee...\r\nAll The Best & God Bless!!\r\n\r\n\r\n   \r\n "
