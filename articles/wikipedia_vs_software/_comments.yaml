    body: "Don't read too much into this.\r\n\r\nThe statistics displayed show a decrease in the rate of <em>growth</em> of Wikipedia, not in the total volume of Wikipedia (which is still growing). That was bound to happen.\r\n\r\nWikipedia's growth rate over the first few years has been EXTRAORDINARY! Its doubling time was well under a year, right up to sizes which are unprecedented in the history of encyclopedias.\r\n\r\nHad it continued to follow that growth curve, it would've exceeded Moore's Law growth of storage facilities, and eventually consumed all disk space on Earth sometime in the next two or three decades.\r\n\r\nNow, obviously, SOMETHING has to start damping out that growth. Very possibly it is merely success -- nearly everything that contributors feel should be there is already there. So, at that point, activity slows down and moves on to improving existing articles. Some of those edits will be infuriating to users whose work is edited, leading to anecdotal stories about revert-happy admins. But as a general trend, it seems fairly natural.\r\n\r\nI was very curious when this would start to happen -- now I guess we know. Which is interesting. But hardly a cause for panic, IMHO.\r\n\r\n"

    body: 'It''s interesting to note that the likelihood of a contribution to a WIKI is greatest when the WIKI is empty. This is also when the likelihood of edits is lowest - there''s simply not that much to edit. As the WIKI grows, contributions must slow down, if not because there is less to write about, at least because the reader and would-be contributor has an increasingly hard time discovering things that have not already been contributed. At the same time, editing rate goes up because there''s so much more to edit.'

    body: "I think that these statistics are rather an alarm signal for Wikipedia. If I should say why I have stopped editing - it is because too many contributions and pages got deleted. If Wikiepdia looses momentum it will potentially die. Momentum is what drives a project. Maybe some believe Wikipedia already has most of the knowledge it could have - bnut I think it is missing most of the common knowledge of humanity - and yes I mean the knwledge that is already written down.\r\n\r\nI have forseen exactly such thing happening. no community can survive such attacks. And I also see the point where Wikipedia will actually shrink and no longer grow. Which is fatal, because as soon as it is not growing and more in user numbers and content the content a lot of the content must be kept uptodate by fewer people. Which means that they cant really keep it uptodate because most content was driven by a much larger crowd.\r\n\r\nI hope we see an alternative Wiki rising which start where Wikipedia has failed. I dont think Wikipedia will be able to revive itself - they already have come to the point where they are so bureaucrativ that they are not flexible any more. They have successfully killed the Wiki principles in Wikipedia. :-(\r\n\r\n-- \r\nThilo Pfennig\r\nBlog: http://flinux.wordpress.com/"
