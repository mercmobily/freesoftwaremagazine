    body: "Your analysis is very good, but it seems to be fighting against an MS Patent Application which was *rejected* by the USPTO within a few days of having been submitted.\r\n\r\nThe too-fuzzy, non-described \"polling process\" was a major problem. But even bigger, the MS Application tries to steal things which have already been invented, and PATENTED!!! by others, including IBM. IBM has been charging different software lease rates, set by software according to actually-in-use hardware capability, since the days of DOS/360 and OS/360 (circa 1964)... and maybe even before then. Burroughs might have patents on related functionality in MCP, too, I don't know. But IBM for sure, and even earlier IBM Operating Systems might have implemented such features too.\r\n\r\nOf course, I'm shocked, shocked, that MS would try to steal someone else's idea and claim it as there own. They'd never EVER do something THAT disgusting. ;)"

Funny how I didn't see their name mentioned once in the article.  Perhaps Mr Richmond needs to study more history.\r\n\r\nHe seems to be under the impression that everyone in thw world must afford to own and operate their own PC.  Perhaps he should visit the third world where internet cafe's thrive where money and electricity is scare.  Renting part of a computer seems like a good idea there.\r\n\r\nHe also seems to confuse a patent with a product.  Surely MS would implement this today of they felt it product worthy.  Oh, but wait, our beloved Google is the one taking the lead here.\r\n\r\nBut more importantly this is more of the never-ending tripe delivered by the open source community that has chosen Microsoft as the evil empire in the technology world.  Never mind the facts, I can write more FUD about MS.  \r\n\r\nI've said it before and will say it again.  The Open Source community will succeed when it doesn so on it's own merits.  Not by pulling down others.  Grow up.\r\n\r\n\\\\uSlacker"
