# The prize

In Dmitri Popov's words:

> B3 is a do-it-all Linux-based personal server designed for use as a hub for your home network. It can serve files, stream music, publish photos, and even host websites. B3's functionality is wrapped into an elegant and user-friendly web-based interface which makes the task of configuring and maintaining the server a cinch. The server's other highlights include low power consumption, a fanless design, and a robust casing that can withstand harsh treatment. B3 is powered by Debian, and you can access the system via an SSH connection, so you have full control of the system and can access thousands of packages in Debian's software repositories.
