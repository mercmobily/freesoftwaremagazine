    body: "Nice post.\r\n\r\nThis ...\r\n\r\n>So, I’d suspect it’s much more likely that Microsoft will shift sideways, perhaps into its media interests or some other prospect, rather than try to change “its ways”.\r\n\r\n...seemed to echo my sentiments that in order for Microsoft to survive they would have to change into something that does not resemble what they are now. This of course is what businesses do in order to survive: witness the change in IBM from a desktop hardware supplier to what is tantamount to a services company.\r\n\r\nI'm certainly not going to sit here and argue that Microsoft will change because I think they are as stupid as you do. So even considering what I said in my post I do think it unlikely that Microsoft will adopt free licencing in the truest sense. I do think they will eventually _need_ to, as will all proprietary software companies or else get out of the software business. This is because I am convinced the software \"business\" is going to eventually be changed for good by free software. I don't know when or how it will happen but now that free software is out of the bag and gathering momentum, it will happen--did I say I was an optimist?\r\n\r\nSo to reclaim something from that phrase you're planning on stealing: Microsoft will have to change because sooner or later the rest of the world is going to figure out that they shouldn't be buying air in the same way as apples."

    body: "The whole point of a corporation (and by extension Microsoft) is revenue streams. Microsoft releasing their operating system as open source would need said corporation to already be making money via some other revenue stream. I cannot recall any time in history that a corporation even a tenth as large as Microsoft has voluntarily closed shop in the face of similar competition. The closures of larger corporations are almost always rooted in failure to continue a revenue stream (after all legal suits, share holder disbursements, etc. were subtracted). Hence we can see that Microsoft will need to change income resources despite share holder directives to produce dividends, a daunting task.\r\n\r\nI cannot see Microsoft completing such a conversion any time soon. Microsoft announced they aren't taking over Yahoo!, and Microsoft's other online services seem to be oriented at excluding FOSS oriented users - in other words, in their private clubs, they only orient themselves towards the successes of the products in Microsoft revenue streams. Microsoft is seeing to it that FOSS is getting badmouthed, indicating that internally, there is minimal management orientation towards adoption and integration with FOSS.\r\n\r\nThat said, I summarize that 3 key elements of FOSS adoption are missing: 1] Microsoft still wants to make money by indenturing its consumers, 2] their audience wants to trust only commercial software and 3] Microsoft wants it that way when they continue to badmouth FOSS."
