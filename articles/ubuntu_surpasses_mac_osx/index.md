I just read on the [Linux Advocate](http://thelinuxadvocate.blogspot.com/) that Google Trends is indicating that the Ubuntu OS has outpaced Mac OS X (as well as other free distros) by a pretty fair margin. However, as the comments on the article indicate, really this is just showing the relative number of searches for "Ubuntu" vs. "Mac OS X." Still, even if it's not an accurate indicator of how many people are installing either OS, I find it significant that a free OS would trump a powerful commercial OS like the Mac's in Google searches. It shows that there are lots and lots of people out there who are at least curious about Ubuntu and are trying to learn more.
