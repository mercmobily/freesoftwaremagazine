Hello everybody, and welcome once again to the fortnightly newsletter of Free Software Magazine: keeping you well informed about the realm of free software! Happy reading!


# General announcements

Had problems lately with your favourite magazine? So have we! FSM is being read by so many people at the moment that during the last few months our poor server has been struggling, and at times, giving up. This is no good for us, and it’s no good for our readers... so thanks to the fabulous people at 3fn.net, we now have a brand spanking new DEDICATED SERVER. Let the good times roll—we won’t be crashing again anytime soon!

# Poll Results—Dell has announced Linux laptops. NOW, when a friend says “I want need a new PC", and he doesn’t want a game machine, what would you do?

Well, 43% of you went with the “Recommend the Dell/Ubuntu machine but don’t push it”. This was followed closely by 33%, who chose “Let them know that the Dell/Ubuntu option exists, and let them decide”. 15% were going with the very definite “Urge to get a Dell/Ubuntu machine” option, and 9% of you would “Tell them to buy a Mac”. AND, just for the record, none of you would recommend Vista! Good for you! Most of those of you who commented were erring on the side of caution. Which isn’t surprising; no-one wants to be the helpdesk for all their friends! Read more [here](http://www.freesoftwaremagazine.com/polls/dell_ubuntu_advice_to_friends) and stay tuned for...


# This fortnight’s poll

[Trivia poll: How many Microsoft patents are broken by free programs?](http://www.freesoftwaremagazine.com/polls/microsoft_patents_broken_by_fs)

Okay so you’ve probably heard by now that Microsoft are at it again. They’re saying that free software applications infringe on their patent portfolio. But this time they’re getting more specific: they’ve told us how many patents they think are being infringed. Not which ones. Just how many. Let us know how many of Microsoft’s patents you think are being infringed upon by free software. (This poll is a little tongue-in-cheek so don't take it too seriously.)

Read more about avatars [here](http://www.freesoftwaremagazine.com/node/1713). To add an avatar: log in, go to “my account” in the menu on the left, go to the “edit” tab and scroll down to where it says “Upload picture”. Now, hit the browse button, find the image on your computer that you want to upload and go to the bottom of the page and hit the submit button. That’s it; you now have an avatar image.
