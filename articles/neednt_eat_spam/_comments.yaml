(AOL/Hotmail??)\r\n\r\n\r\nSurely I agree with the proposals and mostly with the article at large. But the Ironport System list of World's top spam-emitting domains surprised me somewhat. Hotmail and AOL among the worst, so high up? Really??\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHopefully stopping/blocking spam(-sending ISPs) will stop the bulletproof hosting of spammers websites as well. They will have no use for them anyway! ;-)\r\n\r\n<hr/>\r\n\r\n<strong>From</strong>: Joergen Hovland \r\n<strong>Url</strong>: jorgen@hovland.cx\r\n<strong>Date</strong>: 2005-08-02\r\n<strong>Subject:</strong> spam\r\n\r\n\r\n>There is virtually no legal way to upload spam in the United States and many other countries, due to contractual bans imposed by backbone providers on their ISPs, who in turn impose them on their users\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is virtually no illegal way to upload spam in any country.  Don't even attempt to define what spam is, cause you will fail miserably. National laws only define what email which is legal and what is not. Spam is anything, and it is nothing. Some use it for marketing, others might use TV commercials. On the other hand, why should marketing through e-mail be banned by law when TV commercials are not? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr/>\r\n\r\n<strong>From</strong>: Claes T \r\n<strong>Url</strong>: \r\n<strong>Date</strong>: 2005-08-02\r\n<strong>Subject:</strong> \"Illegal\" to upload spam\r\n\r\n\r\n>> ...due to contractual bans imposed by backbone providers on their ISPs, who in turn impose them on their users \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n>There is virtually no illegal way to upload spam in any country. Don't even attempt to define what spam is, cause you will fail miserably.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLeaving the illegal part and concentrating on the contractual bans mentioned in the article...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nToS from ISP:\r\n\r\nÃ‚Â§1 User may not upload any spam.\r\n\r\nÃ‚Â§2 Spam is what we say it is. This will include UBE.\r\n\r\nÃ‚Â§3 To dispute our classification, a proof of opt-in for each addressee must be presented and accepted as valid by us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOf course not exactly so, but you get my point. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n>National laws only define what email which is legal and what is not. Spam is anything, and it is nothing. Some use it for marketing, others might use TV commercials.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAgree. And the relevance of this?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n>On the other hand, why should marketing through e-mail be banned by law when TV commercials are not?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIMO, marketing via email should *not* be banned by law: _CE is'nt a problem, even U_E isn't a problem, nor is _BE. UBE is. Marketing using equipment/resources without permission from owner/the one paying should be banned (spam or not).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://members.aol.com/frederi108/explain/connect_the_dots.txt  \r\n\r\n(not my url, but I like it)\r\n\r\n<hr/>\r\n\r\n<strong>From</strong>: Joergen Hovland \r\n<strong>Url</strong>: jorgen@hovland.cx\r\n<strong>Date</strong>: 2005-08-26\r\n<strong>Subject:</strong> Re: \"Illegal\" to upload spam\r\n\r\n\r\n>>National laws only define what email which is legal and what is not.

And the relevance of this? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe relevance is that it is impossible to define spam in general, therefore it is impossible to ban spam as mentioned in my previous posting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n>Marketing using equipment/resources without permission from owner/the one paying should be banned (spam or not). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd is already illegal in most countries.\r\n\r\nThe problem has always been the prosecution part which is usually nearly impossible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\n<hr/>\r\n"
