    body: 'Nice Piece! I made the switch and I love it. It''s very sad that too many people won''t make the jump. I think is due to software compatibility. I have found lots of free software from the Ubuntu repositories and they are pretty much the equivalent of windows software if not better. Hopefully one day people will commit. I have now I''m trying to get my boss and most of my clients to switch!(yes I know is not exactly on topic,eh...sorry)'

If the kind of bogus patents that we are getting used to seeing in recent years are allowed to go unchallenged then we can wave goodbye to free software in the near future.\r\n\r\n===========================\r\nIn the landscape of spring, there is neither better nor worse.

After all, as you clearly state in this article, the issue of free software is freedom not price, and seemingly criticising Microsoft because they make money confuses and undermines that message.\r\n\r\n--\r\nGNU - free as in freedom"

    body: "Anyone who lived through the sixties and early seventies no doubt has a list of names that come to mind when asked who were the most visible disruptors of the existing order.  Off the top of my head names such as Abbie Hoffman, Jerry Rubin and the Bennigan brothers come to mind.  Others will have their own list.  Two names not on that list will be Richard M. Stallman and Bill Gates.  It is another reminder that the most visible events of any present moment are rarely the events that ultimately change the future.  Students of the history of science have always known this and those who delve into the minute political details of any ruler will find seemingly insignificant turning points that brought us what we have today.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to the idea of free software, I am going to go out on a limb and speculate that software and maybe even all technology companies today (since technology and digital have become almost synonymous) may be the control equivalent today of the Soviet Union and that just as the Soviets were unable to control the flow of information in an electronic age so technology companies will find themselves unable to control software in a digitally networked world.  This doesn't mean however that they won't stop trying.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the day, I think Richard Stallman will be a pivotal figure in future histories written of this period and I have no doubt that more people will know of him in the future than any ever did while he was alive and that freedom in software will be as pervasive an idea in the future as human rights in governance is today.  I also predict that the struggle to fully realize what that idea means and how to implement it will continue for just as long."

    body: "Those are some very good points and I think quite right. Though I think there will be one other name added to that list. Linus.\r\n\r\nPerhaps not because he created Linux but something more important. There have been many many studies done about why software projects fail. Those studies have noted everything from, it was just a bad idea to managerial ineptness to it being just to large a project and just about everything in between.\r\n\r\nWhat Linus is showing and continues to show is how large and I would say huge software projects will be developed in the future. If you watch his talk about git on youtube ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XpnKHJAok8 ). He makes some points about real distributed SCM that I think is spot on and is the direction most projects will go, eventually.\r\n\r\nSo yes, IMO Mr. Stallman for sure is one of those pivotal figures that will be in the books for waking us up and getting us back to the way knowledge and information should be done. But Linus IMO will also be there for showing us how to do it."
