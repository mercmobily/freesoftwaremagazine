    body: 'The article seems relatively misleading.  You''ve done all your tests on a computer with 4GB of ECC Memory, 2 250 GB HD''s, and an opteron 1200 CPU, yet you say prices *start* at $845.  Well, What does the $845 get you?  It certainly doesn''t get you a Dual Core Opteron at 2.8 I know the newer models of those chips retail for 2 grand or more, and even the Italy model is almost $800 retail.  But still, for my money, and I do a lot of database and software development in *nix and Windows, nothing beats the value that the Mac Pro gives me.  Support for 32 GB of ram, 4 Drive Bays, an extremely sturdy enclosure with excellent cooling characteristics. And on top of that, I can get 4 Cores, for about three grand with the specs you list, and 8 cores for four thousand.  It would be nice to know how much a configuration like the one you used costs for comparison''s sake.'
