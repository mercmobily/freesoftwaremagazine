    body: "Surely, if there appears there might be market- and Linux-choking illegal actions being committed, we should make noise. Better that than to go and try to burn down Microsoft's lair.\r\n\r\nARM vendors might not be beholden to Microsoft. People have been saying that ARM might be how Linux gains a strong position. Perhaps Linux' gains on x86 might never be but marginal while Microsoft is around.\r\n"
