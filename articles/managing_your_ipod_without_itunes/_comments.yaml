At this point, Rhythmbox does fine with my ipod and all of the emails I get through my tutorial site reveal that I am not alone.  It's a no-brainer.\r\n\r\nGTKPod used to be a staple on our machines LAN-wide, but Etch reveals that Rhythmbox trumps GTKPod now.  One cannot have both on their machine anymore.  I'm thinking that this is a good thing, because of the default Etch install that many users will no doubt be perfectly satisfied with.\r\n\r\nHowever, I do miss the functionality of GTKPod, namely, its renaming and other convention tools.  GStreamer is coming along nicely and its king-fu is strong.\r\n\r\n--machiner\r\ndebiantutorials.org"
