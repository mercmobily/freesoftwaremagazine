    body: "> I think I ought to attempt something brave: I would like to coin a new word: the Groklaw effect.\r\n\r\nIsn't that three words?\r\n\r\nJoking aside I think you've hit on something here. Yes the many eyes theory is nothing new but what Groklaw and -- in this case -- El Reg do is bring the company under the gaze of those eyes. I've seen similar calls for places where a company is immorally using software patents and the \"victim\"  has asked for examples of prior art.\r\n\r\nThis is yet another example of power changing hands and there being a greater voice for the public thanks to the Internet."
