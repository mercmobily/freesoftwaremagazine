General announcements
=====================

Top ten Free Software Daily stories this week
---------------------------------------------

1. **OpenOffice.org goes to LGPLv3** --You may recall that a team from Sun devoted a great deal of time to the process of drafting the GPLv3. Our engagement was not just the monitoring exercise that I suspect it was for many of the corporate participants. [Read more...](http://www.fsdaily.com/Legal/OpenOffice_org_goes_to_LGPLv3)

2. **Bazaar is now a GNU project** --"I'm happy to announce that Bazaar is now officially a GNU project. This decision was taken after consultation with some of the core Bazaar developers, Canonical management, and Richard Stallman, leader of the GNU project..." [Read more...](http://www.fsdaily.com/Community/Bazaar_is_now_a_GNU_project)

3. **The U.S. voted no on Microsoft Office standard at ISO** --In all the talk (and there’s been plenty of talk) concerning the ISO meetings on Office OpenXML (OOXML) one point stands out. The U.S. voted no. [Read more...](http://www.fsdaily.com/Legal/The_U_S_voted_no_on_Microsoft_Office_standard_at_ISO)

4. **From Evil to Good: List of Formerly Closed-source Software** --Increasing number of software applications are going the free/open-source way these days. Looks like more and more software companies and developers have seen the barriers of closed-source programs and have now fully realized the significance of freedom. [Read more...](http://www.fsdaily.com/Legal/From_Evil_to_Good_List_of_Formerly_Closed_source_Software)

5. **Free Software Supporter** --"Today we released our first issue of the Free Software Supporter, a subscription based monthly newsletter that highlights the work of the foundation as well as provides updates from the GNU project.

6. **Petition calls for Open Standards in the European Parliament** --"At a time when the EU Commission investigates the anti-competitive behaviour of a market-dominant player, the European Parliament (EP) still imposes that same specific software choice on both the European Union's citizens and its own MEPs. OpenForum Europe, The European Software Market Association, and the Free Software Foundation Europe today launched a petition to call on the EP to use Open Standards so that all citizens can participate in the democratic process. [...] The signatories are encouraging citizens and other stakeholder groups to publicly support the objectives of the petition by signing up on www.openparliament.eu ... [Read more...](http://www.fsdaily.com/Community/Petition_calls_for_Open_Standards_in_the_European_Parliament)

7. **Open-source 3D printer built with Linux, can even replicate its own parts** --This is an amazing device: The RepRap (short for "Replicating Rapid-prototyper"), an open-source printer developed at the University of Bath. It was built using Linux, and all of the project's software and hardware components fall under the GNU General Public License. It's cheap to use, and can even replicate most of its own parts. Most of this article is an interview with the technical lead, plus there are links on the first page to videos and sample parts and objects made with the RepRap. [Read more...](http://www.fsdaily.com/Industry/Open_source_3D_printer_built_with_Linux_can_even_replicate_its_own_parts)

8. **Open source: the key to sustainable savings in public sector IT** --The UK's budget is looming and the public sector is charged with increasing spending on front line services by 4% while budgets go up 2%. Free and open source software is a way of saving millions of pounds in licensing fees and delivering often better products, this article argues. [Read more...](http://www.fsdaily.com/Government/Open_source_the_key_to_sustainable_savings_in_public_sector_IT)

9. **GNOME Foundation and Mozilla Foundation join forces** --The GNOME Foundation and the Mozilla Foundation announced today that they will increase their collaboration to improve developer support and user experience of desktop applications on GNU/Linux and other free software systems. [Read more...](http://www.fsdaily.com/Community/GNOME_Foundation_and_Mozilla_Foundation_join_forces)

10. **Microsoft May Have Bribed India for OOXML Pressure** --Back in August we warned that Microsoft had just made a very suspicious donation at a very strategic time. It only days before the September vote on OOXML. The article which was cited at the time has vanished, but you can find a copy here...
