Yes, you add that the OSS guy got \"lots of work\" out of the exposure. But did he make any money? Has his life actually improved? Why don't you tell us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThen you make the (mind boggling) case that a developer was somehow fortunate to live under an oppressive, murderous totalitarian government because that government appropriated his invention and made millions for itself. Alas, but we know his name. Thank you, no.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNext time you want to make a case for open software, at least come up with some examples that actually support your premise and conclusions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMichael"

It seems to me that in order to make money, one has to eventually give in and accept that working on Free software won''t pay the bills.  I''m assuming of course that the software he worked on at Sony and NVIDIA was proprietary.'

    body: "This article reinforces what has been obvious to me all along -- you can't make a business out of writing free software. The example given here is pretty sad. What you're basically saying is that the only way programmers should be making money is by working for someone else. If that was the only way I could make money from writing software I wouldn't even be in this industry.\r\n\r\nOk, so open source projects let you show off all kinds of stuff to potential employers. That's great for people who want to be employees (which would probably involve writing proprietary software by the way), but not everyone does. Mike Boeh is making a nice living from selling his games while being his own boss. Daniel Horn didn't make enough to even pay a month's rent but had the \"privilege\" of working for a bunch of high profile employers. I'll take working for myself writing my own games over being an employee any day."
