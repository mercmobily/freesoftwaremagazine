    body: "Wait, are you saying there is free beer out there?  Free as in free beer?!  Let me read the Wired article... ah, I see. :-)\r\n\r\nGreat article and what a great idea -- thanks for the link.  And I love it, Stallman saying it should be called \"free software beer\" instead of \"open source beer\".  Open source beer sounds better as a marketing mechanism, and he couldn't have asked for a better opportunity to protest and explain the difference.\r\n\r\nI'm all for calling it free software and talking about what that means, but am also ok with using FLOSS or FOSS to promote inclusiveness.  On my blog I mention the words \"open source\" along with free in the hopes that people will find me when looking for information about open source.\r\n\r\n----\r\n<a href=\"http://www.movingtofreedom.org/\" title=\"Freedom is on the March!\">http://www.movingtofreedom.org/</a>"

    body: "What I've read about RMS was back in the day of unix he gave away software and source for free but had to charge to put it on the large data tapes in that era.  Once receiving the software anyone was \"free\" to change the source code to add features or optimise it to run on a different machine.  \r\n\r\nOne time I was visiting New York City and I got to see the fashion police in action chasing down people selling fake purses.  Who knows the fake purses might have had extra features.  Isn't the basic design of a purse public domain?  With all of the software patents the software police will be after me and you just because our do loops look the same as theirs.\r\n\r\nI think everyone who writes a novel program considers how can I make money doing this.  I think publishing is a good place to start. "

    body: "The agenda of this project, I think, is to bring the ideas behind free software to the minds of people who would not normally think about it. Strictly speaking, recipes are not covered by copyright, and transferring the methodology 1:1 is of course wack. Nevertheless we may learn something while trying.\r\nSo, whether or not the beer is tasty or succesful as a business model is another story entirely. I doubt that \"FLOSS Beer\" would work in this sense..\r\n\r\nIf youÂ´re interested, read or listen to this RMS interview: http://free-beer.dk/blog/archives/20\r\n\r\nHenrik\r\n "
