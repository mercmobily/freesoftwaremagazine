    body: "I think your association of the work slave with \"Black people\" is a reflection of your own prejudices.\r\n\r\nGoogle define: slave -\r\n\r\n# a person who is owned by someone\r\n# someone who works as hard as a slave\r\n# work very hard, like a slave\r\n# someone entirely dominated by some influence or person; \"a slave to fashion\"; \"a slave to cocaine\"; \"his mother was his abject slave\"\r\n# slave(a): held in servitude; \"he was born of slave parents\" \r\n\r\nSlave was arguably the hottest of the 1970s Ohio funk bands. Slave had a great run in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Trumpeter Steve Washington formed the group in Dayton in 1975.\r\n\r\nSlave is a term often used in BDSM to conote a specific form of submissive. Such a person could also be a masochist or bottom, but this is not always the case.\r\n\r\nI think your association of the work slave with \"Black people\" is a reflection of your own prejudices."

I'm Mexican-American, possibly a descendent of slaves (see Indian Slavery in Latin America), and a KDE user/programmer.  My point:  slave!=black, kde!=white, and person!=American\r\n\r\nI watched a television program on Discovery or TLC about race, and I was surprised when a black person was offended that a white woman called him a \"beautiful black creature.\"  They were upset saying that the word \"creature\" meant monster or animal.  Everyone knows that there have been monsters called creatures, but it is a general term like \"organism.\"  Even the dictionary lists \"human\" as one definition of creature and I recently heard a white preacher refer to his white congregation (and all of humanity) as creatures.  How come when white people say creature to other white people, they mean \"human\" or \"organism\", but when they say it to a black person, they must mean \"monster\" or \"animal\"???  It seems to me that black Americans are always *looking for reasons to be offended* so much that they invent reasons to be offended.  You don't like rap music?  You must be racist.  You don't hire a black guy who looks like a gangsta rapper...you must be racist.  You don't hire a white guy dressed like a head banger...that's okay because of the dress code.  I used to agree that maybe the Confederate flag shouldn't be displayed because so many people were getting offended.  But I am starting to think that it is just another example of over-reaction by blacks.  Remember the boy who cried wolf?\r\n\r\nAnother example:  whenever black people get traffic tickets they say, \"I got pulled over because I'm black.\"  I am thinking, are you sure it's not because you were speeding or because your windows are illegally tinted?  I mean, I've gotten traffic tickets.  I could easily say that I got pulled over because I'm Mexican...but then I remember that I was in fact speeding or that I did have illegal window tint applied.\r\n\r\nTrust me, as a Mexican American, I know all about racism.  And I have experienced as much racism from blacks as whites....so I don't give anyone any slack when talking about race.  I also think that it is too easy to pull the race card.\r\n\r\n"

Your argument seems to be along the lines of \"one has to watch the context in which one uses words\".  I would agree with that premise, I just think your logic proceeding from there is feeble.  The context for the use of \"master-slave\" terminology with computers is in terms of <em>entirely non-human, non-living objects</em>.  Hell, in the case of KDE, they aren't even objects, they are more concepts than anything else.  There are all sorts of words that <em>can</em> be offensive when aimed directly at people, but which are completely inoffensive in other contexts-- spade, chink, box, kraut, ape, cracker, bitch, ricer, frog, snatch etc.  Should we stop using all of them, too?  Should rape victims protest the use of \"mount\"?  Should murder victims complain about the use of \"kill -9\"?\r\n\r\nNo, of course not.  (And, yes, that last part about murder victims complaining was a joke.)  Why not?  Because, as we have agreed, it all depends on the context.\r\n\r\nI hate to say it, but your post really has the flavour of somebody who is looking for something about which to complain.  Something easy to point a finger, declare \"<em>j'accuse</em>!\" and then go about the rest of your day without having to spend too much effort.  Sure, if KDE gave these slaves icons that looked like blackface caricatures, then I'd completely agree with you.  What if KDE had named them Helots instead of slaves?  Would you have complained?  I have to say I doubt very much you'd have made a peep-- not because there would not be the same reference to slavery, but because this reference wouldn't serve your own personal agenda of being personally aggrieved.  How about if they had an icon showing a guy carrying a stone to a pyramid?  Again, it is slavery, but you seem to make no mention of-- nay you seem to be utterly uninterested in even acknowledging any form of-- slavery other than the one that serves your particular complaint.\r\n\r\nBlacks, indeed all non-whites, have plenty of legitimate problems to overcome in this country and in the world.  This is most assuredly not one of them.  Even if it were, it would still be so far down the list that I'd have a hard time believing that you didn't have <em>something</em> better to do.  I am well aware of the power that words have over the way people think, and of the kind of damage they can do when used to hurt.  This, however, is just not one of those cases, no matter how much you may scowl.\r\n\r\nTo be honest, when I first started reading this, I thought it was some pretty clever satire.

Here's a rough breakdown.\r\n\r\n3 people agreed with the article; 1 asked to supply a replacement word; 1 was in quasi agreement and didn't like client-server either; and the rest (the majority of comments) consisted of personal characterizations (I'm dumb, stupid, prejudiced, racist, etc), rationalizations for the use of the word, based on history, linguistics, politics, or just because it didn't bother them.\r\n\r\nAll of these respoonses were to be expected, given the state of current human development. \r\n\r\nOne thing, though, that does stand out in most of the opposing comments is the degree of emotional vitriole, insecurity, and ignorance that permeates their comments, and almost a complete lack of objectivity, sensitivity, or intellectual curiosity about the ramifications of my premise.\r\n\r\n<strong>Insecurity married to ignorance make a dangerous couple.\r\n</strong>\r\n\r\nI think many of the commentators did not even read the full article, and reflexively entered into an instant attack mentality because the topic obviously pushed a button that threatened their sense of control and power. This was displayed in all the comments that questioned why I even bothered to raise this issue (because I wanted to, as if I needed their permission -- that's the power thing) and in raising this issue violated some unspoken rule or sense of propriety.\r\n\r\nThere is so much in these comments that I could dissect and deconstruct from a political, cultural, historical, technical, psychological, sociological, and linguistic, et al, perspective, but it would not be useful in this forum. Others who review these exchanges should feel free to do so in their own fields of concentration.\r\n\r\nI was glad to see at least one person ask (to me) the obvious question that would logically address my concerns: <strong>What word could be used to replace \"slaves\"?</strong>\r\n\r\nI had thought about this before submitting the article, but waited to see if anyone would try to \"solve\" my problem with \"slaves.\" Since, as I write this, no one has submitted a replacement yet, let me venture one now, and give you my rationale.\r\n\r\n<strong>I propose the KDE project replace \"slave(s)\" with \"kelf/kelvs\".\r\n</strong>\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\nUsing the KDE propensity to put a 'k' on the front of words, I take the word 'elf' and put a 'k' on it.\r\nElvs/elfs are little mythical creatures, which have a range of personalities (can't you see each component having its own individual avator), who live underground in communities, and do their stuff out of sight of normal humans activity. Aren't these the characteristics of the software components in question? Also, kelf/kelfs/kelvs are also single syllable words, like the current singular/plural word forms, and take fewer letters to write, making replacement in documentation an easy 'find and replace' operation. But most importantly, a kelf has no inherent historical, cultural, political, etc negative baggage associated with it.\r\n\r\nNow if you don't like that, please submit your alternative.\r\n\r\nJabari"

So, from now on, I suggest that we no longer use the following analogies in process naming:\r\n\r\nsupervisor/worker\r\nmaster/slave\r\nserver/client\r\nkernel/daemon\r\n\r\nand instead use:\r\n\r\npimp/whore\r\n\r\nSo, from now on, KDE will have IO-Whores, and when we make a change to a unix system log, instead of saying \"I need to sighup the syslog daemon\", we will say \"I need to bitch-slap the syslog-whore.\"\r\n\r\nThis is certainly not racially evocative ... both pimping and whoring cross all ethnic boundaries.  Further, while \"pimp\" tends to refer to men, there are certainly women who take on that role (as madames), and there are men who take on the role of whores.  Therefore, it is also a terminology that crosses gender lines.  It also crosses lines of sexual orientation.  As such, I would assert that any RIGHT THINKING individual should have no problem with this new terminology.\r\n\r\nI propose that we refer to this as the \"Ice-T model of software design\".\r\n\r\nNow, if you'll pardon me, I need to go **tch-slap my mail server.\r\n"

The current usage of the word serfdom is not usually synonymous with slavery, because Medieval serfs were considered to have some (though limited) rights. Slaves are people who are owned and controlled by others in a way that they have almost no rights or freedom of movement and are not paid for their labour, aside from food, clothing and shelter needed for basic subsistence.\"\r\n\r\nSo, I guess slave actually refers to white people after all!\r\n\r\nI know... this is a **** argument, but so is the article...\r\n"

Let us know if we are wrong.  I am pretty sure that you witnessed the pre Civil Rights times and therefore will never view the world as it is, but as it was.  That being said, it is interesting that you referred to discussions that took place in the 70's and/or 80's.\r\n\r\nThe TV show I referenced earlier about \"creature\" was called \"Black. White.\" and it was on FX.  On the same show, a teenage black man argued with his parents because they were saying that when they go to stores they can feel everyone looking at them (like if they are going to steal).  The kid disagreed and basically told them they were being paranoid.  I think that is a perfect example of the generation gap.  The parents still view the world in pre Civil Rights days and \"feel the eyes on them\" even though most of the eyes started to go away some 20 years ago.\r\n\r\nAnother story.  I was at the mall once with a white girl that I know and she was looking at some black guys because she has (I don't know why) this attraction to guys of the gangsta-rapper culture....I would bet without a doubt that those guys would of said that she was looking at them out of racist reasons....without even considering that she was actually *checking them out* because she liked them.\r\n\r\nMy point is that you guys are pulling the race card way to often and for petty reasons.  That is why nobody had any intellectual interest in your article....their interest has been drained.  This is why I said you guys remind me of the boy who cried wolf.  I have had much more meaningful race discussions about much more important topics, like the racial inequalities of prison sentences and the death penalty or of pay inequalities.  I will protest in the streets hand-in-hand with you to fix issues like that.  But if you want me to even identify with the issue of KDE I/O Slaves....sorry dude.  Being Mexican American, I am too busy trying to grasp how I feel about the illegal immigration debate to waste one ounce of compassion on this terminology issue.\r\n\r\nWrite an essay on an a real and important issue and I'd bet you'll get a much difference response.  Especially from open source people since they are generally of the tree-hugging variety.  You just picked the wrong issue. Maybe...just maybe you are wrong on this.  Have you considered that?\r\n\r\nP.S.  By \"you guys\" I meant P.C. police...as I know how offensive \"you people\" is and \"you guys\" is only one word away.  Furthermore, I learned the phrase \"you guys\" from a black person...so please don't hang me for that one.\r\n\r\nP.S.S. Sorry if \"hang\" if offensive.  Just kidding!!!\r\n"

Richard Stallman has frequently spoken of the importance of language and terminology -- in particular, Free Software vs. Open Source and Linux vs. GNU/Linux. To me it seems incredibly ironic and unfortunate that the readers of Free Software magazine are so contemptous of the idea that free software should use terminology that also honors freedom.\r\n\r\nI commend the author of this article, and I think all the negative reactions demonstrate that deep down, everyone knows the point is valid. People become very angry and defensive when they are challenged about something that they know is questionable, but don't want to have to take the trouble to think about. Another example of this is the anger directed at vegetarians by meat eaters -- deep down, people sense that there is an ethical issue they don't really want to face, so their insecurity becomes defensiveness and anger directed at the individuals who make them think about things they would rather ignore.\r\n\r\nRMS says that one of the reasons people like to use \"open source\" rather than \"free software\" is that they don't want to make people uncomfortable by reminding them of the larger issues of freedom and justice. The larger issues of freedom and justice that the free software movement addresses are important, and paying attention to how we label and speak of our tools is a valid concern."

I think it is very interesting that you can quite so clearly shrug off the vehement opposition to the view you proposed in this article while also obviating the closed state of your thought process.  Perhaps you cannot conceive of a world in which your attempts at finding an oppressor to retaliate against are futile, and that this post serves only to give people with nothing else to do an opportunity to elevate your words to the opinion of others in your community.\r\n\r\nI only hope that you can perceive that attempting to apply your freshman psychology to the opposition of others does nothing to further your argument than your attempt at dismissing it through proposing a ridiculous solution.  Whatever your reason for this article in which you call out KDE as some supporter of oppressors far and wide, it is apparently not educated in the much broader use of this terminology.  I propose to you a possibility different than you have supposed in your response and that is the forum you have chosen to present this opposition in is not sympathetic to your cause.  Perhaps this would be better received in either a semantic study group or among the activists trying to revoke the use of the word \"nigger\".  I assure you anyone interested in reading the content of this magazine is already quite familiar with the field of semantics and we are not amused.\r\n\r\nIf you really feel so strongly about this matter I call upon you to do several things.  First of all read all the definitions for the word slave in any dictionary, even the ones after your favorite.  Second, attempt to grasp the broad use of the slave/master terminology in not only computer software beyond KDE but also in mechanical engineering and even the science of such fundamentals as time, use internet searches if you have trouble with this one.  Third, if you really feel that you are correct go start and run a public action group against the use of the word slave in *all* the ways it is used.  Fourth, stop wasting our time with this drivel and start contributing something of use like code or documentation to KDE or a competing free software project."

It could also be because your argument is poorly made, and insults the motivations of a group of well-meaning people. You did suggest that the KDE developers condone and promote human slavery by using the word slave to describe their programs. It's going to take more than a bit of hand-waving and idle threats to deconstruct your audience to make a charge like that stick. If you can't support your argument more thoughtfully you are not going to get much in the way of reasoned dialog.\r\n\r\nIf you want to persuade me, here's what I need to know:\r\n\r\nWhat injustice is caused by 'enslaving' a computer process? How is this morally equivalent to enslaving a human being?\r\n\r\nIf a computer process is absolutely subservient to another process, and so fits the definition of 'slave', why is using this straightforward descriptive terminology problematic?\r\n\r\nSlave is not a derogatory term. It describes a deplorable condition for a human to be in, but it is not, in and of itself, an insult. Neither are words like child, dumb, corrupt, etc. How does a word that simply and accurately describes the relationship between two computer processes insult or demean anyone?\r\n\r\nIf a word that means something bad in one context should be avoided in all contexts should we also rename the unix commands kill and killall? If not, how is this different from the problem you describe for the use of slave? Does the killing of child processes have some greater social significance with respect to human child abuse?\r\n\r\n'Master' and 'slave' immediately suggest the structure of the relationship between two entities. Kelf means absolutely nothing. It conveys no information about the process it would describe, since it is an imaginary word you just invented. Avoiding descriptive terminology for fanciful creations just increases the jargon-load in an already heavily-laden field. Do you have a more practical alternative to suggest?\r\n\r\nThis is an important subject, and I will do my best to examine my own motivations here. Perhaps, as you suggest, I am reacting out of my own racism, fear, and desire to cling to what power I have. On the other hand, maybe your argument is weak and inflammatory, and that is what generated the quality and quantity of feedback received. I would honestly like to know more about your position; please take a moment to clarify you argument for us.\r\n\r\nTyler"

At minimun, KDE is implicitly condoning the legitimacy of human slavery (and some of the commentators to this list have come out and said they saw nothing wrong with slavery). What you must honestly acknowledge, whether you think that was KDE's intent, that is my (and others) perception, and my perception is reality to me, and yours is to you.\r\n\r\n<strong>\r\nIf you want to persuade me, here's what I need to know:\r\n\r\nWhat injustice is caused by 'enslaving' a computer process? How is this morally equivalent to enslaving a human being?\r\n</strong>\r\n\r\nKDE is not 'enslaving a computer process.' The computer widgets KDE calls \"slaves\" are inatimate \"things.\" They do not live, they have no feelings, and the issue has nothting to do with how these widgets are used or treated. The issue is that the enslavement of human beings is a pernicious, demeaning, oppressive, and internationally recognized illegal act.  KDE's use of \"slave\" certainly accepts (if not promotes) the concept and practice of slavery, and the idea of master over a slave.  These are acts of \"injustice.\" The KDE project sides with being the \"slave master\" and not the abolitionist.\r\n\r\n<strong>If a computer process is absolutely subservient to another process, and so fits the definition of 'slave', why is using this straightforward descriptive terminology problematic?\r\n</strong>\r\n\r\nI addressed this in blog itself, did you not read it?\r\n\r\n\"But the KDE io-slaves seem to be a very important and essential core elements of the KDE infrastructure. They possess highly specialized functionality, are designed to provide an efficient and ubiquitous set of tools for application developers to interface to, and thus are valuable components which enhance the utility of KDE. These qualities seem to be the antithesis to those of \"slaves.\"\"\r\n\r\nComputer components (hardware/software) are designed to work together, to perform specific tasks, and by default, are necessary and essential to the operation of the system, or they wouldn't (shouldn't) be there. Only a person coming from a preconceived social/political/cultural/etc perspective of power relationships would see the interaction of hardware/software from a master-slave mindset. One software routine is not subservient to another, they work in cohesion as designed.  There is no cohesion in a human master-slave relationship, it only exist through tension, force and fear.\r\n\r\n<strong>Slave is not a derogatory term. It describes a deplorable condition for a human to be in, but it is not, in and of itself, an insult. Neither are words like child, dumb, corrupt, etc. \r\n</strong>\r\n\r\nTyler, being kind, this is dumb bullshit. I don't know where you are from, or where you've been, but let me take you to where I'm from and been, and you say that to people there, and they'd let you know how derogatory they feel about the word. You are mentally masturbating yourself if you think referring to someone as a \"slave\" is not a derogatory term. Would you like to be enslaved? Stop jerking yourself off, and face the overt reality of the horrendous and illegal institution of slavery.\r\n\r\n<strong>How does a word that simply and accurately describes the relationship between two computer processes insult or demean anyone?\r\n</strong>\r\n\r\nAgain, the word doesn't accurately describe the relationship between computer processes, it describes the power relationship between groups of people that has been overlayed onto the interaction of inatimate things. People tend to anthropomorphize nonhuman things to make things easier to understand, but its a warped association in this case.\r\n\r\n<strong>If a word that means something bad in one context should be avoided in all contexts should we also rename the unix commands kill and killall? If not, how is this different from the problem you describe for the use of slave? Does the killing of child processes have some greater social significance with respect to human child abuse?\r\n</strong>\r\n\r\nStrawman argument. This is unrelated to my points and issue. Killing a child process is technical jargon related to software administration and does not come out of a previous derogatory social context. Plus, I did not call for the abolition or removal of the word \"slave\" from common use. Again, a fictitious argument.\r\n\r\n<strong>'Master' and 'slave' immediately suggest the structure of the relationship between two entities. \r\n</strong>\r\n\r\nMaster-slave says absolutely nothing about the specific interaction of hardware/software but only implies the degree of importance, or time relationshiop. You could just as easily use primary-secondary or parent-child to represent the same concept (which, in fact, have replaced master-slave).\r\n\r\n<strong>Kelf means absolutely nothing. It conveys no information about the process it would describe, since it is an imaginary word you just invented. \r\n</strong>\r\n\r\nKelf intentionally does exactly what you say its does. It is merely a noun to denote a class of code devoid of previously noted derogatory baggage. Each kelf would have it own funcionality as currently defined -- sort of like Keebler cookies (I like the chocolate chip myself).\r\n\r\n<strong>Avoiding descriptive terminology for fanciful creations just increases the jargon-load in an already heavily-laden field.\r\n</strong>\r\n\r\nHey, I didn't decide the jargon-load in KDE, they determined all their krazy names themselves (pun intended).\r\n\r\n<strong>Do you have a more practical alternative to suggest?\r\n</strong>\r\n\r\nNo, I like that. You got something better? We could always have a contest!!\r\n\r\n<strong>This is an important subject, and I will do my best to examine my own motivations here. Perhaps, as you suggest, I am reacting out of my own racism, fear, and desire to cling to what power I have. \r\n</strong>\r\n\r\nI am glad you recognize that the underlying issues involved here are important. Each of us can only act on the base of information we possess to derive understanding from. Our continual task is to increase our base of accurate information so we can derive a more knowledgeable, sophisticated, and realistic understanding of life.\r\n\r\n<strong>On the other hand, maybe your argument is weak and inflammatory, and that is what generated the quality and quantity of feedback received. I would honestly like to know more about your position; please take a moment to clarify you argument for us.\r\n</strong>\r\n\r\nAgain, if my argument is weak, then merely present a stronger argument in a coherent, respectful way. I am totally open to learning a new perspective on everything. However, the quantity and quality of other peoples responses does not speak to my deficiencies, but theirs. No one else in opposition responded to me like you have.\r\n\r\nTyler, the unspoken overriding issue here is power. Like I said before, the power to name is the power to control. That is why so many people have so vehemently lashed out at me personally, I am threatening their self-imaged sense of power over me.\r\n\r\nIf, as many people have stated, \"slave\" is just a word, well then, since it is just a word, then they shouldn't really care if I propose to change it. It's just a word, right, No meaning, no importance, right?\r\n\r\nWell, we all know words do matter. The wrong words will get you killed in this world. And as someone has commented, this is why Richard M. Stallman (RMS) is such a stickler on the use of language and definitions.\r\n\r\nBut finally, as I, and others, keep imploring for people to reconcile, how can you logically and philosophically promote the idea of FREE SOFTWARE, while condoning the use of language, in a major Free Software project, that promotes, even if only indirectly, slavery -- the antithesis of freedom?\r\n\r\nPlease think about these things long and hard. I look forward to your response.\r\n\r\nHotep (Peace)\r\n\r\nJabari"

Maybe many of the posters and myself misunderstand your argument, maybe you should succinctly clarify/summarise your argument.\r\n\r\nThe way I see your argument is like this.\r\n\r\nKDE uses the word slave to describe a subsystem.  This means that KDE is condoning human slavery.  We need to get them to stop using the word slave to reduce/abolish slavery.  We need to kill the concept of slavery to get it to end.\r\n\r\nI'm sure that I am not the only person to read your argument this way.  When you drop sentences like \"The enslavement of humans will end only when the concept of slavery ceases to exist.\", I think it is reasonable to assume that you want to wipe the word from dictionaries (how can the concept not exist when dictionaries give it to anyone who looks) and make humanity forget about it (this is where the 1984 and Fahrenheit 451 comments come from, as with the comments about forgetting history).  You really should read what you write before you dismiss your arguments as a strawman.\r\n\r\nSlave may not be the best term to technically describe what is going on, and if that were the entirety of your argument, I would agree.  However, your assertion that using the world slave in this context condones human slavery is IMHO ridiculous.  You dismiss the parallels of killing processes as a strawman, claiming that \"killing ... does not come out of a previous derogatory social context.\"  I fail to see the difference between killing and enslaving in terms of how derogatory they are.\r\n\r\nYou obviously have very different options about what constitutes condoning and derogatory than a lot of people, and no amount of argument is going to change that.\r\n\r\nI for my part apologise if my arguments seem impolite.

So instead of Master/Slave:   Bonder and Bondee\r\n\r\nAnd furthermore – I see that there are two ways to go, instead of erasing the word and the connection to the history (or the current present level) of slavery, we can propose KDE use the new terms to point to what is actually happening  now. \r\n\r\nNot only change to bonder & bondee but we can take up a collection to an antislavery  organization.   There is a connection between open source, giving, beneficence, and freedom.    \r\n\r\nI will digress for a moment. A female friend of mine a couple months a go came to me and told me she had been drugged and assaulted. She had no control of the situation even though she knew what was happening to her and pleaded with the man to stop.  She has terrible feelings about this even though it’s not her fault.   So this event (my night with her at the hospital) comes back to me as I realize that I have little inkling of what it means to have no power, to be a slave for years, to have little control for years ,let alone minutes. \r\n\r\nFrom this antislavery site, I see that this is happening in the same world you and I are writing our codes.  We are indirectly involved – for example if our laptops have Coltan that may be from the Congo, or not, it doesn’t matter, since the price in one place affects the price in the war regions, and becomes a motor for the war, the killing, and the bonding.\r\n\r\nSo instead of an erasure, or an argument about the word  “slave”, we can, now from anywhere in the world – if we desire it – contribute through paypal or through donating software or services – to fight slavery.   We could do it together or separately; we have that choice.\r\n\r\nMaybe Bonder and Bondee is not catchy, but we could somehow commemorate what is going on.  Let’s rename it “Master” and “Anti-Slave” and when someone asks in 5 years why it’s “Anti-Slave” because it behaves like a slave, people can say, a bunch of coders renamed it because they wanted something good to come of it, and BTW started a fund against slavery. \r\n\r\nIt’s just a thought at the moment. \r\n\r\nWhat’s clear is that people are spending a lot of time dwelling on this posting, we could do something else with our time and talent.  We were either lucky to be born on the side of the planet where we are not bonded, or we struggled a bit to get to the place where we could write code and type up some argy-bargy at our leisure. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

With this in mind, as a practical matter, I really think the author would perhaps be a little more convincing to more people by addressing specifically as many of the points brought up repeatedly by different readers. In particular, how far do we go to clense the language of the very many potentially insulting terms [eg, kill]? It would not be fair to a lot of people if we deal with \"slave-master\" and stop there. And how about the trouble most would have to go through to change the language they already understand for the sake of possibly only a few when the majority don't seem to intend any offense by the terms? They apply them under a context that is nothing like the context where use of such words would really be deragatory.\r\n\r\nAs others have said, there are some really important areas where we can work on eliminating discrimination and badness, but I am not convinced that this is one of them. Having \"bad\" words around is not all that bad because I think context is significant. Plus, you can't put the genie back in the bottle. The concept of slaves and masters won't disappear if we don't talk about it. And if we are going to use it, is it not better that the context be proper? Tell me that KIO slaves are anything but slaves. I tend to believe that most people having an escape (eg, playing violent video games, seeing horror movies, etc) lead to a more peaceful world because we have a relatively peaceful environment in which to ponder about good vs evil. Plus, we don't feel as much a curiosity or need to experiment if it is clear how bad something can be (so I say don't trash the movies about violence or slavery either.. a lot of people are probably not violent in part because they have seen how horrible things can be and had some time to see themselves in another's shoes). Plus, if you keep me and my friends from talking as we are comfortable, why can't we not also keep you and your friends from doing so? Free speech? Yes, words are powerful and can incite hatred, but they can also extinguish it. \r\n\r\nA better received essay would probably have involved a study of real cases and concluding that more harm than good would result from the continued use of such language under the given context. It still might get criticized, but it would be preferable to simply saying some people are insulted so we should all change despite virtually no one intending harm by the use of slave-master.\r\n\r\nWhat is more important is that we understand each other, not precisely what words we use. What is more important is that we not be doing bad things, not whether or not it sounds as if we might be doing bad things. You can expect me to behave, and I can expect you to let me talk as I wish. ...Don't judge a book by its cover. That is the important lesson all of us were trying to emphasize through our continued reference to kio slaves.\r\n"

To that end, would somebody suggest something along with a rationale as to why this new term is more precise?\r\n\r\nKeep in mind though that there are probably more accurate words to use in a lot of circumstances, but people tend to like speaking other than absolutely precisely in many cases (for different reasons). I think what is most important is that nothing bad is intended by use of the terms (eg, no one expect anyone else to murder a human if they use the kill command repeatedly). Forcing people to be too nice (in some cases), might just make them move their aggression elsewhere or attempt to act it out more forcefully. If I want a slave, you better give me a slave!\r\n\r\nThe best thing is probably to simply start using alternative words in your own code and over time people might change or those originally offended might find they are no longer offended (and they may feel even more free). Lead by example (or get a really cool person to lead by example). It is easier and less painful to break habbits if there is a new one that can replace the old one. Also, carrots might just be better than sticks [think of how many more people probably drank during prohibition]. Let me have my slave, but do let me know about a more profitable and enjoyable alternative if you know of one.\r\n \r\n \r\n"

That is why so many people have so vehemently lashed out \r\n>>at me personally, I am threatening their self-imaged sense of power over me.\r\n\r\nMaybe the response is not about people wanting to have power over you, but their perception that you want to have power over them, with respect to the terminology they use. \r\n\r\nOn reflection, I think you are probably correct in your view that master-slave is not the most accurate way to label inter-related computer components. If you had focussed your argument on that, you might have convinced some people to use a better alternative, whether that be client-server, parent-child, call-response or whatever. But you cripple your own argument by claiming that any resistance is based purely on the overt racism of anyone that opposes you. As soon as you claim that the only source of opposition is the racist intentions of your opponents you reframe the debate in a way that precludes rational discussion. You present two choices - you're a racist, or you agree with me. This excludes the possibility that I could disagree with you without being a racist. Which means if I want to object, I have to defend my character first, rather than just focus on the issue at hand.\r\n\r\nCertainly, as a white person I don't understand the social context of slavery in the same way as you. What you don't understand about race issues generally is how frustrating it is to have honest questions responded to with the claim that the question is racist in intent and doesn't warrant serious consideration.\r\n\r\n>>So, are you saying people may have felt \"insulted\" because they are in favor of the\r\n>>concept of slavery, and it is an affront to them that I oppose slavery?\r\n\r\nNo, this is ridiculous. Slavery has been abolished in the western world, because we have collectively agreed that it is an absolute evil. You don't insult people by opposing slavery, you insult them by assuming, on very flimsy evidence, that they are in favour of it. \r\n\r\n>>\"But the KDE io-slaves seem to be a very important and essential core elements of the\r\n>>KDE infrastructure. They possess highly specialized functionality, are designed to \r\n>>provide an efficient and ubiquitous set of tools for application developers to \r\n>>interface to, and thus are valuable components which enhance the utility of KDE. \r\n>><strong>These qualities seem to be the antithesis to those of \"slaves.\"\"</strong>\r\n\r\nYou are using your own definition of \"slave\". Checking the Oxford English dictionary, I find the following:\r\n\r\n1. a person who is the legal property of another or others and is bound to absolute obedience, a human chattel\r\n...\r\n4. a machine, or part of one, directly controlled by another\r\n\r\nThere is nothing in either definition of slave that is dependent on ideas of specialization, efficiency, value. If you were building a pyramid in ancient Egypt, slaves would be essential to your task. If you were running a household in ancient Rome, your slave might have specialized skills (literacy, numeracy, hosting etiquette, market savvy). The antithesis of slavery is freedom, not specialization or value.\r\n\r\n>>KDE has absolutely chosen to use terminology which emanates from a very specific \r\n>>social/political/historical context denoting a power relationship between groups of \r\n>>people, and applied it to the interaction of software components.\r\n\r\nWhich specific context is that? You assume that the KDE developers are motivated by their admiration for the plantation owners of pre-civil war USA, and an active desire to promote the return to such inequity. More likely, they have chosen to use the word slave in a more mechanistic, and literal, way: the slave process is absolutely subservient to the master process. 'Slave' (imperfectly) describes this relationship, and doesn't require us to adopt any particular social policy just because we apply the term to computers.\r\n\r\n>>You are mentally masturbating yourself if you think referring to someone as a \"slave\" is \r\n>>not a derogatory term. Would you like to be enslaved?\r\n\r\nYou're missing the point. I don't want to be enslaved, not because the word is insulting, but because the condition is. If I were enslaved my situation would not be improved by using a different word to describe it. You are right, in that slave could be used as an insult. But it still has value when we discuss issues of dominance and subservience. When I refer to the people who built the Egyptian pyramids as slaves, it's not an insult, it's a statement of fact; that's what they were. \r\n\r\nCalling someone a slave who is not a slave would be insulting, presumably you would be attacking their capacity to think for themselves. In the same way, calling someone a bitch is insulting, because it associates them with the negative aspects of a female dog. But the word 'bitch' itself is not the insult, it is the particular context it is used in. If we're talking about breeding dogs, then we need a word for female dogs, and bitch is the one we use. And when we're talking about slavery, we need a word to describe the subservient party, and slave is the one we have. Getting rid of it would limit our capacity to openly discuss the issue.\r\n\r\n>>Strawman argument. This is unrelated to my points and issue. Killing a child process is \r\n>>technical jargon related to software administration and does not come out of a previous \r\n>>derogatory social context. Plus, I did not call for the abolition or removal of the word \r\n>>\"slave\" from common use. Again, a fictitious argument.\r\n\r\nThis is not a strawman argument, this is the part of your thesis that confuses me most. You can accept that killing a child process is 'technical jargon... and does not come out of a previous derogatory social context'. That's exactly the point many of us have been making for the 'slave-master' terminology as relating to hardware and software. The killing of children has been part of any number of social contexts, from the killing of female babies in China, the use and abuse of child soldiers in Africa, ritual sacrifices in the Americas, the abduction and abuse of children by pedophiles. You can accept that these are all distinct from killing a child process, but not that using a slave process is anything but a direct endorsement of using the same practice in a social context. I don't see the difference. \r\n\r\n"

    body: "I think you're right in manifesting discontent for the use of the word \"slave\" or anything related to it in the free software community. I think it's a matter that shouldn't be taken lightly, for it still has strong implications in ours everyday lives.\r\nI'll give an example to illustrate the point of how important it is to know what the real meaning of a word is:\r\nHere where i live restaurants often give you the option in theirs menus of drinking \"natural fruits juice\". Now, to make things more profitable they often add a little bit of water to this beverage. As it became common practice a few of them added more and more water until nowadays, what you're ordering in fact is water with a bit of \"natural fruits juice\". This is no longer what it used to mean originally, and so it should be perceived as a deception. But it is not, because it was so gradually introduced into people's minds that it's common acceptance and just a few (among them tourists, i guess) complain about it.\r\nSo my opinion is, slavery is in it's most accepted meaning a form of exploitation of human beings, in which they lose control of their lives and can not take most of the decisions that humans should be able to take. So i agree with you that the term should be scrapped and KDE should use another better word for it. I don't think such good programmers would have a hard time to find it."

    body: "Software doesn't understand slavery, people do - this is a purely context related issue. I will never understand what it is like to be enslaved in the context that you speak of, and it's unlikely that YOU will truly understand it either. You are likely several generations removed from Black American slavery. Slave is a valid word so why is it's use in electronic/software contexts so bad. It doesn't mean that the people who wrote KDE were thinking of Black Americans slaves when they wrote it, quite likely they know very little of the plight of Black Americans! \r\n\r\nOne of the nice things about open source software is your right to modify it to suit your needs. Maybe you should put out a politically correct version of KDE. See how long it lasts until someone finds something offensive in it, based on their context.\r\n\r\nPS. The term slave loosely originates from the \"Slavic\" people of Europe. Should they be offended too?\r\n"
