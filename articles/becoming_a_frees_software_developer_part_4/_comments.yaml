[long story made short] My dad wanted a database so gave me an old 386sx and his DB software so I could 'program' it for him. Since then I have made:\r\n\r\n- A database program for building Warhammer Armies\r\n- A CRM program for a local contractor\r\n- A recipe database\r\n- Software database (records software installs and install codes -- track compliance)\r\n- A program for doing weekly student reports at a K-12 institution (using a database ofcourse)\r\n\r\nTo be honest I can't think of why people think that databases are boring... the proper structure of a database and the ability to present the information in a meaningful way is a skill that escapes a great many programmers I know. [scare tactic] Database Normalization. Boo!"

And of course, they all have to be written in Apache-ese, which is some bastard-child of config format and XML which doesn't follow the rules of either, and then you have to set directives like \"ActuallyDoSomething\" and \"NoReallyIActuallyWantToUseTheServer\".\r\n\r\nUsually, by the time I've got all of that working, I've completely run out of time for the project and/or Debian has released a new version and retired the old one, so that the one package I absolutely have to have to do the project requires a complete system upgrade, including the database and web application server, which breaks interoperability between all of the components, due either to massive API redesign or a decision to \"reform\" the security configuration files so as to make them even more difficult to figure out.\r\n\r\nBut, yeah, once you get through all of that, databases can be fun.\r\n"

A database is a set of data organised into records and possibly tables (a spreadsheet of addresses could be called a database). You use Kexi to create and manage databases, without those it is pretty useless.\r\n\r\nYou said...\r\n<cite>People don’t program just because they want to learn. They don’t even program because they have a need. People program because they are interested in getting something done, and they are willing to do it themselves.</cite>\r\n\r\nAm I alone in that I program for all of those reasons? If programming wasn't expanding my horizons (for want of a better term) then I wouldn't be interested in it. I always program to fulfil a need: without a real target I find I soon give up and the project falls by the wayside. Yes I am interested in getting something done and I am willing to do it myself but those are not as high a motivation as the first two.\r\n\r\nI thought your original plan (to write an application) was a good one and perhaps you shouldn't be put off because you chose an app you feel is a little needless. Find something that isn't or reassess the method you chose. Also - for me anyway - the fact that somebody else has written a suitable application only precludes my having a go at one if I am pushed for time (or if the application is huge - you won't find me writing my own web server just yet). Often it's the journey and not the destination that counts.\r\n\r\nIn any case if you are going test Kexi to any length you are going to have to apply it to a real world example. Perhaps you can approach PT again for the purposes of testing Kexi. If a calendar can do what you want then examine the method you use, what could be improved? How could it serve the task better? A Calendar on the wall cannot for example display the day of your cycle or prompt you if you haven't entered the start of a new one. It cannot report over the course of a year the regularity of the cycle and it could not remind you to stock up on chocolate two days before the predicted start of the next one. Being a bloke I have no idea if these are important - it's just what I've picked up from being married - but think bigger than just replicating the calendar and pencil.\r\n\r\ngood luck\r\nRyan"

    body: "\"Kexi is a data[base] management application not a database.\"\r\n\r\nBut for much of the world, \"database\" is also a abbreviated term for \"database management application\" -- at least when speaking informally.  Call it a metonym.\r\n\r\nBut even \"database management application\" is imprecise. Kexi is a *frontend* for a database management system (which is probably going to be MySQL in Rosalyn's case).\r\n\r\n\"You said...\r\nPeople don’t program just because they want to learn.

It's the \"just\" that makes this distinction.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if we can discuss anything more trivial, though. ;-)\r\n\r\nReally, though, people program for all sorts of reasons -- it depends a lot on your temperment. You have to really want to do it, though -- it's easy to start projects, but hard to finish them.\r\n\r\nWhat intrigues me most about Kexi is the CASE tool that it's supposed to have -- apparently you can graphically design a database system using something like an E-R diagram and have Kexi generate the tables for you. I think that sounds pretty cool. I haven't tried this (I've just seen some screenshots), but I look forward to seeing it in action.\r\n"

It’s the “just” that makes this \r\n> distinction.\r\n\r\nOkay, then I am excluded--c'est la vie. I have written several small applications--many of which never leave my own computer--solely with the aim of learning a new language or technique. Sometimes I rewrite one just to see how I would do it in a different language (but less often since I got married and had kids I must confess).\r\n\r\nWhen Rosalyn says _\"People program because..\"_ surely the implication is that programmers only or mostly or even generally program for the two reasons she gives. From this I inferred that people don't program for the heck of it or as an extended hobby but my experience is that people do (I am not alone in my methods above). Maybe I've read that wrong though. Maybe I am as sad as I appear :o) Perhaps I am being too pedantic though, perhaps she meant \"when people program with the intention of releasing it\". Rosalyn care to clarify?\r\n\r\n> Please let me know if we can discuss anything more trivial, though. ;-)\r\n\r\nOh now, don't get me started, among my friends I have a reputation for trivia (particularly the useless kind). :o)\r\n\r\nSeriously though the main point of my comment was to encourage Rosalyn not to give up on her idea simply because something else exists. Much free software--by necessity--as ended up duplicating functionality of other software. I think she should be congratulated because she is engaging with the community and is trying to give back, that's a good thing."
