    body: "What's annoying to me is that Android has *never* had a way to filter apps by licence. It's something I (and others) mentioned [in 2009](http://www.freesoftwaremagazine.com/articles/linux_based_phones_why_are_gnu_linux_users_treated_second_class) and the fact that nothing has changed says (to me) a lot about Google's attitude to free software.\r\n\r\nThere are some lists of free android apps around but filtering those out of the myriad of zero-cost lists is a task in itself. [F-Droid](http://f-droid.org/) is useful but may or may not be complete depending upon whether the developers submit their apps there as well. For those interested these (in no particular order) are the lists of free[dom] android apps I know of but all of this could be moot if Google just added filtering by licence to the market!\r\n\r\n* [https://wiki.koumbit.net/AndroidFreeSoftware](https://wiki.koumbit.net/AndroidFreeSoftware)\r\n* [http://trac.osuosl.org/trac/replicant/wiki/ListOfKnownFreeSoftwareApps](http://trac.osuosl.org/trac/replicant/wiki/ListOfKnownFreeSoftwareApps)\r\n* [http://www.aopensource.com/](http://www.aopensource.com/)\r\n\r\nAs for Ubuntu..?
