    body: "Whilst I agree that Free Software should not be restricted to a single subset of Operating Systems I would have thought that ReactOS will probably struggle to ever be free.\r\n\r\nWhat I mean is that GNU/Linux, BSD et al are POSIX based and thus share a common root with Unix - rather than being based upon it. ReactOS is an attempt to implement Win32 under a free software licence. By definition this means that the features of ReactOS are dependant upon decisions made by Microsoft and nobody else. Thus ReactOS, although under a free licence, brings with it all the hassles of a non-free environment: proprietary drivers etc.\r\n\r\nSo if the people behind Unix decide to make fundemental changes it - the free software alternatives are free to ignore those changes if they want to. ReactOS is restricting itself to adopting decisions made by Microsoft.\r\n\r\nOkay it also has the advantages of free software - it can make Win32 available to a wider range of architecture - but by trying to re-implement Windows XP (i.e. the latest available version) are they not tying themselves down a little?\r\n\r\nPerhaps it would be better - and would have a wider audience - if they reimplemented the Windows9x range - especially as Microsoft have finally stopped supporting it."

    body: "My understanding is that, in common with Wine, ReactOS will be able to effectively run as several different \"versions\" of Windows (or that even if this is not currently true it is likely to become so because of the design).\r\n\r\nThat means that it can run Windows \"9x\" software.\r\n\r\nThe current Windows may be a moving target, but it's fair to point out that it's really the existing base of software, written for fixed versions of Windows that is of interest.\r\n\r\nOTOH, one problem is that the software being preserved is almost without exception non-free software. Anything for which we have source code and a free license is subject to being ported to GNU/Linux in the usual way (easier than writing a whole new O/S!).\r\n\r\nLinux was a crowning achievement in the free software world, because it eliminated the one remaining barrier to having a 100% free software environment on your computer. ReactOS isn't leaning that way, because even though it's shooting for a free kernel, O/S, and GUI, you're still doing it in the service of proprietary applications.\r\n\r\nSo, IMHO, it will always be a niche application. OTOH, it's a pretty big niche, because there are a lot of users out there with legacy Windows apps that they don't want to lose access to. I myself have a collection of games in a drawer somewhere that I'm going to try out with Wine when I get some time to mess with it.\r\n\r\nOTOH, there is also the remote possibility that ReactOS and the Win32 architecture will display some technical advantages. If so, then it becomes a potential rival free O/S in its own right.  I don't think ReactOS is likely to be it, but surely <em>some</em> new, innovative O/S will come along to challenge the Linux/Unix supremacy in free operating systems. \r\n\r\nAfter all, the central insight behind this magazine is that it isn't really about \"Linux\", it's about \"Free Software\".  On mere technical merits Linux is a solid O/S, but it's not earthshattering -- it's the fact that it's GPL'd that matters.\r\n"

    body: "...but which is kept in mind by ReactOS developers: since their OS is free (as in speech), they can actually improve or add whatever they feel is missing from the proprietary version - for example, a strict system/administrator/user rights separation, as is done in the *NIX world, or a more efficient DOSbox (:p)\r\nUNIX lost against GNU/Linux because not only was the free OS free (as in beer), it was also very stable (more stable than some proprietary UNIXes) and more customisable, while at the same time not changing usage and programming habits much.\r\nWould computer users disgusted by Microsoft's OS products due to their high prices, lack of individual consumer support, or bad architectural choices be equally unhappy with a system that would run the software they choose to get (be it free or proprietary) in the way they want it to?\r\nRight now, the best kernel Microsoft has produced is that of Windows 2003 SP1; it has been reused in WinXP 64-bit and in Vista - and it is, actually, a VERY good kernel. Glue a user interface more similar to KDE than to GDI on top of it and provide enough APIs and tools to have fun with the system, and you get for Windows what GNU/Linux was to Unix: a better, free replacement.\r\n---\r\nA computer is like air conditioning: it becomes useless when you open windows."

    body: "All I got for sure was that you don't like Windows, but you seem to be suggesting that ReactOS is a bad idea because it will encourage people to stick to Windows.\r\n\r\nReactOS would be related to Windows in the same way GNU/Linux is to SCO Unix (or Solaris or AIX).  It's still a free O/S, and the nature of bazaars is that bugs are more likely to get fixed. There's probably no fundamental reason why ReactOS couldn't be a great operating system in its own right. Users using ReactOS, likewise, would not be \"continuing to use Windows\".\r\n\r\nThere are, of course, three things it has to overcome:\r\n\r\nFirst, it's chasing tail lights. As long as Windows is the standard, it's playing catch-up.\r\n\r\nSecond, Windows doesn't have a solidly thought out technical design when it comes to things like security and multiple users. That's because the original O/S was just not meant to do those things and so they were added as an afterthought. ReactOS can't veer too far away from that design if it wants to retain 100% compatibility (and if you don't, why not just run Wine on Linux?).\r\n\r\nThird, it's very niche. Most Windows users are going to keep using Windows, no matter how perfect ReactOS is, and most free software advocates are going to stick to GNU/Linux (most of the rest will be on one of the BSDs). ReactOS, like FreeDOS, has a fairly small userbase.\r\n\r\nThat's going to be true unless and until they do something really innovative, but the truth is, that's much more likely to happen with Linux. So it's a bit of a long shot.\r\n\r\nOTOH, I hope they succeed. The fact that all of the free O/Ss in the world are POSIX type, is not good in the long run. There needs to be some technical competition. ReactOS is a perfect opportunity for those folks who believe Windows to be technically superior to try out their ideas. After all, ReactOS can compete on an even footing with Linux in a way that Windows can't, being non-free.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    body: "...they're certainly valid, and some worthy differences have to be pointed out:\r\n\r\n1- playing catch-up: sure, but since Microsoft isn't adding much to its subsequent revisions of win32 (they may even trim them down a bit in Vista, at least I read something about that), the target may not be so hard to reach - provided ReactOS limits itself to being a base OS (does it need to reimplement all of Windows Media Player for example? Or .Net (which does have Mono anyway) ? Or all the Wizards? Not necessarily - and Microsoft can't veer too far away from win32 for compatibility reasons.\r\n\r\n2- Windows' technical design isn't bad /per se/ - it's just buried under useless additional software that abuse it. Trim a Windows machine to the bone and set up correct user and hardware rights, and it gets very interesting. Now, one of ReactOS' developers' goal is to correct - as much as compatibility allows - those remaining flaws. Remember that Linux, with its monolithic model, isn't the best designed kernel either.\r\n\r\n3- It's niche, like GNU/Linux used to be (and still is in some markets). However, if you tell an OEM: 'you can either keep paying the Microsoft tax or install a free, _100%_ compatible OS legally on your cheap machines without licensing hassles' there might be a bit of interest. Of course, due to MS pressure and inertia, it may be a long time in the making - but imagine creating an OS that could run all games, all home productivity and entertainment software, and most professional applications and networks (meaning a WinXP home clone with flexibility added and hardware locks removed), it may score a few hits. It would also be successful on refurbished machines only capable to run no longer supported OSes.\r\n\r\nOne interesting problem though, is that RMS defined the UNIX standard with his POSIX specifications - Minix, GNU/Linux and xBSD followed them. Win32 is still defined by Microsoft (while still open and submitted to ECMA, if my memory serves me well).\r\n---\r\nA computer is like air conditioning: it becomes useless when you open windows."
