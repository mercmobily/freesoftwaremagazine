Rosalyn has really written a tutorial for those of us that just need someone to say "go here" & "do this". Thank you soooo much Rosalyn.'

The brushes are used for the pencil tool, the paint brush tool, and the eraser tool.\r\n\r\nYou can open the brushes menu by selecting File> dialogues>brushes. Or you can push together the buttons shift + control + b.\r\n\r\nDid that help?"

I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling it but still get the one full window. The reason I wanted too get the one main tool window is because that is the way you say too start making banners because I have spent hours trying too learn how and still don''t know anything. Right now I would just like too know how too make a 120x40px banner with some text and be able too put into a website of mine. Well, hope you can help and thanks alot.'
