    body: 'Glad you like it! It''s something that the LibreOffice developers might add as an extension - a dialogue with which you could add favourites to a ''quickie'' special character chooser. But this script can be used with any word processor or text editor on your computer. And it''s another example of what us tinkerers can do with the big box of tools we''re given in the FOSS world!'
