    body: "Hi Stuart,\r\n\r\nNo, I was not able to find a way to boot directly from an iso image.  But it was also not the intended goal.  Since grub works independently of the kernel and disk image, I can copy the compressed-cloop file (usually KNOPPIX or such), along with the kernel and minirt file, save it to my flash drive, and it would work great.  Some distributions, like DamnSmallLinux rarely ever change kernels (DSL 2.3 still uses 2.4.26), I don't even need to copy over those files.\r\n\r\nAlthough not much, copying the entire iso would take up a little more space.  Not only are there extra files on the iso image, but there's the properties of the iso image files (Joliet and RockRidge extension information) that would all need to be saved on my flash drive.   This is probably not much, but I'm working with a 256 MB drive.\r\n\r\nSo the short answer is no.  But let me know if you come across a way to do it!"

I just spent the past two days to find out how.\r\n\r\nuse grub for dos (http://grub.blogeden.cn/post/23308/2412 - it's in chinese though)\r\n\r\nIf you just want to do something like in linux live cd, i.e., the iso file is used to host the systems files, it's easy and straightforward to use iso.\r\n\r\nIf you want to boot from a iso file on a harddisk, do something in menu.lst like\r\n\r\ntitle Boot from iso on a harddisk\r\nmap (hdX,Y)/your.iso (hdZ)\r\nmap --rehook\r\nchainloader (hdZ)+1\r\nrootnoverify (hdZ)\r\nboot\r\n\r\nThe iso file must be in one chunk - contig from sysinternal http://www.sysinternals.com/Utilities/Contig.html may come handy. It's a good idea to use fat32 to host the iso file.\r\n\r\nAlso check out\r\nhttp://www.911cd.net/forums//index.phpshowtopic=15617&st=20&p=101928&#entry101928 \r\nand \r\nhttp://www.911cd.net/forums//index.php?showtopic=18045\r\n"

I think if you do a bad search it can get confused.  Quit and restart doing the commands in order.  I also think that tabbing can confuse it.  Took me a few tries but it worked.\r\n\r\nAnyway, thanks for the article, it really helped!"
