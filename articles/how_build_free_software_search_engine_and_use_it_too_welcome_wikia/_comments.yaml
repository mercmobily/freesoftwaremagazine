    body: "\"Of course, like any search engine, there is scope for abuse as there has been in Wikipedia but Wikia is evolving and as problems arise solutions will rise to meet them.\"\r\n\r\nYou really are full of the JimboJuice cocktail, Gary.  Do you know ANYTHING about the real Jimmy Wales?  Look at Wikipedia!  What makes you think abuse will be curbed in a FOR-PROFIT environment?\r\n\r\nI hope you enjoy volunteering your time and labor and intellect, so that a man like Jimmy Wales can profit off you.  (I'm sure the Moscow \"personal health\" industry will be pleased, too.)  At least on my wiki (MyWikiBiz.com), the contributors earn and keep 100% of the ad revenues from their banners.  So, if they want to visit a Russian massage parlor on their own dime, that's their decision."
