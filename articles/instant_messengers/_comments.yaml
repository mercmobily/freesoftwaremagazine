There might be confusion when talking about the name.\r\n\r\nAnd I see from http://code.google.com/apis/talk/libjingle/license.html that Google's libjingle is free software, so other clients can implement it. Probably with a different filename than XEP-0166 implementation."

Don't quote me but I think it has webcam support via their own protocol, and its available for Win, Mac and *nix.  It also has built in remote desktop control (windows only) and peer to peer (ie no filesize limits) file transfers, photosharing, user-hosted chat, and some simple games.  Being Java based, most of it works the same regardless of which OS it is on.  You should check it out.   \r\n\r\nwww.qnext.com"

    body: "First, a good article.\r\n\r\nYou could also use a server side gateway to connect to other IM services.  And Jabber support that, which they call Transport.  It works as well (or even better) than the multi protocol clients I tried (which usally is quite bad when it comes to Jabber).\r\nMy experience is that they support many protocols, but not very good.  Jabber-only clients usally supports Jabber much better.  And it is just a matter of register at a Transport service at a jabber server, for instance Jabber and ICQ, to be able you connect to other IM services. There are lots of gateways out there that give you that service for free.  \r\nOne more thing with Jabber which makes it a better choise, in my opinion, is that there are more services than just chat that is comming along in Jabber.  Like connections between different web services and your IM account.  The other propritary protocols are much harder to use for this kind of services.  Just ask <http://imified.com/> about that (which is a cool application by the way).\r\n\r\nYes, and you can be logged into same account from many computers at the same time.  Try that with MSN and your account on the other machine will be logged out (except through a Jabber Gateway).\r\n\r\nAnd I forgot, I use Gajim, http://gajim.org/, as it is an excellent Jabber client which has a very god integration with Gnome. And I chat with MSN, ICQ and IRC with that one. And yes, you can rename contacts and put many contacts togethere under one name."
