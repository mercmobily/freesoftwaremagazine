    body: 'I''m not sure what kind of things you have to do with tables, but OpenOffice Writer definitely allows the creation of tables, as well as the ability to export as a PDF readily accessible.  My only general complaint with it is that it''s rather bloated, but I used Abiword for a while and ended up switching to OpenOffice just because there were features missing that I needed, and my own uses weren''t even that intense.'
