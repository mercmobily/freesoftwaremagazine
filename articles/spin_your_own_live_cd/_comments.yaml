Although, there is a difference between that and Revisor: Revisor uses the build tools used in creating the official Fedora releases, such as Pungi and livecd-tools; Reconstructor uses shell scripts in a chroot of an existing official spin. \r\n\r\nThis seems a bit pedantic to point out, but I feel the key fact of this is that *all* the tools used to build the official Fedora releases are available for anybody to use, on any system.\r\n\r\nJon\r\n"
