# Poll Results—What’s your favorite news hub for free software news?

Aw. Thanks guys. It turns out that 57% of you have nominated FSDaily as your favourite news hub!

# This fortnight’s poll

[How do you feel about the GPLv3?](http://www.freesoftwaremagazine.com/polls/how_do_you_feel_about_the_gplv3)

There’s been a lot of controversy over the recent release of the GPLv3. But what do you think? Do you think it’s exactly what the free software movement needs? Do you think it has some problems? Or do you think it is not required and that the GPLv2 was fine without the changes? Please let us know your thoughts on the matter and give us a comment if you have anything further to add.
