TurboCASH features everything one would expect from accounting software $450 or more. And since it's governed by the GPL, TurboCASH is FREE !! - no 30-day trials or restricted versions.\r\n\r\nThe developers of TurboCASH have been around for over 18 years and have an impressive client base throughout the world; with a current user base of around 15,000 registered small business entities, and hundreds of others being added every month; some of these users keep a book of over 3000 debtors and process 12000 invoices per month.\r\n\r\nPlugins, tutorials and support come at a price (but not unreasonable)."
