I recently spoke with Bruce Snyder of the [Geronimo](http://geronimo.apache.org) project about this open source Java app server under the Apache Software Foundation. 

My favorite quote from Bruce:


>“I have a saying I've used for years that I think sums it up: With open source, we come for the code, but we stay for the people!”
