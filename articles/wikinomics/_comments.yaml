    body: "The usual history of Free Software includes the guy who started it all. Richard Stallman is barely mentioned in this book. Free Software is a lot more than the Linux kernel. I was particularly disappointed with the report that Linux was licensed under a General Public License so that it could be freely shared. To bring up the concept of the GPL without the context of GNU and the FSF is really disrespectful. It conveys the idea that it has always been possible to use a copyleft, Free Software license. A tremendous amount of time and energy went into developing that license, and building a community around it. The presentation in Wikinomics ignores all that, opting for the simpler story that Linus created it all from scratch.\r\n\r\nOf course, the kernel is critical, and Linus' role in driving that project is very important. But RMS was there to get the ball rolling in terms of building a community. And while he may not be as active in writing new code today, his philosophy has inspired collaborative communities beyond the confines of computer programming. The founder of the Creative Commons, Larry Lessig, was inspired in large part by the Free Software movement. Much of what falls under the umbrella of wikinomics can be traced back, not to RMS, but to the Free Software community that he was instrumental in developing in the 80s.\r\n\r\nThis is where the 'open source' label really fails us. It makes it too easy to ignore the philosophical underpinnings of the community we belong to. I know GNU/Linux is an awkward mouthful, but if it was in common use then it would be much harder for people to define the start of Free Software as being the Linux kernel.\r\n\r\nTyler"
