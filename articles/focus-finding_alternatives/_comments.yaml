One important point was left out however.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen companies look for software solutions, they can choose between propriety software and free software. However, from a company's perpective, it is important to choose the right software for the job, be it propriety or not. Sometimes, just sometimes, free software is not always the *best* solution."
