    body: "Thank you Howard for this very nice and clear article about REXX.\r\n\r\nHowever the script in \"Finishing the job\" is limited to list the email addresses ending with \".com\" only. Therefore I would suggest to use instead of the <strong>pos('.com', string)</strong> rather\r\n<code><strong>\r\nPARSE VALUE .. WITH ..\r\n</strong></code>\r\nor \r\n<code><strong>\r\nPARSE VAR ..\r\n</strong></code>\r\n\r\ne.g. like this:\r\n\r\n<code>\r\n/****************************************************************/\r\n/*  Display the Names and Email Addresses from an old           */\r\n/*  Compuserve address book.                                    */\r\n/*                                                              */\r\n/****************************************************************/\r\n                                                    \r\nstring = linein('addrbooklist.txt')      /* Read the input file */\r\n\r\ndo while  pos('INTERNET:', string) > 0   /* Process each Entry  */\r\n   parse var string name_part 'INTERNET:' email_part\r\n\r\n   /* Extract the first and last names as:   Last, First        */\r\n   name_part    = reverse(name_part)\r\n   name         = word(name_part,2) || ' ,' || word(name_part,1)\r\n   name         = reverse(name) \r\n   name         = left(name,20)            /* Left-justify name */\r\n\r\n   /* Extract email address    */\r\n   email = word(email_part, 1)\r\n\r\n   /* Display the Name and Email Address  */\r\n   say   name  email\r\n\r\n   string = delword(email_part, 1, 1)  /* Adjust the string */\r\nend\r\n</code>"
