    body: "Great! But you describe how to change the RSS cover once. The next time the RSS feed is to be downloaded, you will have to change the cover image again. I have on my reader two newspaper rss and would like to change the cover image once to stay. The best would be, if I could get the front page of the respective paper daily, but I suppose this is not possible if the publisher does not provide it. Can I at least fix the logo of the newspapers? This would be nicer, and on the screen of the reader I could better distinguish the papers.\r\nThanks for your help!"
