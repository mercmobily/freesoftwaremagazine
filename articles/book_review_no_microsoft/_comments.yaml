I first read the \"How to Ditch MS\" book, but was quickly perplexed at how much of a \"commercial\" it was for Apple's OS X. Too little was said of GNU/Linux systems - wwwwaaaayyyy to much was said of Apple's stuff.\r\n\r\nStallman's book, however, was right on. My first read went pretty quick, as I did read quite a few of his essays before. What really got me hooked on that book is that after my first read I decided to do some research on what \"Society\" meant, which lead me to the first section of \"Common Sense\". After (re)discovering that, I re-read \"Free Software, Free Society\" and EVERYTHING Stallman said made sense.\r\n\r\nI would definately buy Stallman's book over this book (especially if you are reading this site, you already know just about everything in Tony Bove's book).\r\n\r\n________________________________________\r\n\r\n    From: lord of the links\r\n    Url:\r\n    Date: 2006-02-18\r\n    Subject: link -> sample chapter\r\n\r\n    The link to No Starch Press leads to a quite strange site... this one looks better:\r\n\r\n    http://www.nostarch.com/\r\n\r\n    There is a sample chapter to read too (pdf): http://www.nostarch.com/download/sayno_ch4.pdf"
