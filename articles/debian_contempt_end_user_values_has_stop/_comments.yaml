I guess you sort of realize that. So quit whingeing about it, and install Ubuntu. But first, do a little online research and find out exactly what hardware is supported, before you go out and buy something that just isn't going to work. Because that would be your mistake, and your problem. Incidentally Debian is an excellent distro, and I find the sidux version to be even more excellent -- but not for ignorant n00bs. No offense, by the way.\r\n\r\nWhat you experienced I have also experienced on non-free software. Specifically, very, very expensive products from Microsoft, Apple, Adobe, and dozens of others. Software I like got orphaned. Including fonts. So? Nobody is forcing upgrades on you. If you like an old tool, keep it (and if necessary, the supporting environment, including old hardware and OS versions) around. They'll (probably) keep going for years. If not, deal with it. You are creative, right? Move on. Incidentally, there are tools for converting ttf fonts to other formats. You do backup your fonts and other linked files, right... ?\r\n\r\nYou feel that Debian (and by extension, other FOSS developers) have \"contempt for 'end user' values\". But this is very, very wrong. FOSS developers are donating their time and energy to provide something for free, to the community. End of story. You have no claim on their time, or priorities. Accept their gift. Or not. Give back, if you can.\r\n\r\nA lot of things in Gnu/Linux OS seem difficult at first. But ask yourself: how much time did it take you to get proficient at Windows and/or Mac OS? Me, it took years. Learning all the obscure little helper apps, what tool works best for what particular job, what breaks, what the work around might be. Gnu/Linux is like that, too. Some of the best Gnu/Linux tools are developer tools, not graphic design tools. Big surprise, eh?\r\n\r\nStill, it's come a long way. I still rely on Photoshop for some stuff that the GIMP just doesn't cover. Ditto Illustrator/Inkscape. But I rarely boot into Windows or Mac anymore, maybe just once or twice a week (ok I sometimes cheat and run Windows in VirtualBox).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

I have additional fonts under `/usr/local/share/fonts`, which is where I want to keep fonts that aren't maintained by the package system.\r\n\r\nI don't particularly like to do per-user installations of anything, since we have five accounts and generally prefer them to all be able to use newly installed software.\r\n\r\nEven if what you suggest works, though, it represents a significant design failing, since `defoma` is still the documented font manager in Debian. If there's a work-around or if font management itself has become obsolete, then that should be noted in the package descriptions, bug-listings, or in Debian policy documents. I have run into situations like that before (in fact, it's probably the most common failing in free software community projects -- to fail to note when a system has become obsolete).\r\n\r\nI don't think that's actually the situation here, though. It appears that Defoma is still a needed system.\r\n\r\nHowever, let me re-emphasize that I'm not asking for tech-support. I know I will solve _my_ problem. What I find interesting about this is what it says about the state of the Debian distribution.\r\n\r\nThis is a particular kind of problem that we can't just \"legislate away\". You can't write a policy document that says \"packagers will value end user concerns\" and expect that to have any effect. The reality is that people (\"honest people in good faith\") will disagree on what a statement like that even means.\r\n\r\nMore management, better management, or regulation is _not_ the answer. Nagging these particular packagers is not the answer either. They already know that their decisions are not satisfying to all users (the reports have already been filed by other people). They've been actively choosing to ignore that feedback -- presumably for reasons they think are valid. That's what's significant about these three problems -- they aren't \"bugs\" in the usual sense. They are _disagreements_.\r\n\r\nThe only thing that is going to be effective is to have a larger, more accessible pool of competing packages and to have meaningful metrics that will offer guidance to users and incentive to packagers (as a group, not necessarily individually) to make their packages stand up better to user expectations.\r\n\r\nIn other words, it needs to be more like a \"free market\".\r\n\r\nThis would take some serious engineering to change. Debian has already done a _lot_ of engineering to make their package system good (IMHO, the best yet). But I think this exposes some ways in which it isn't yet all it could be.\r\n"

As desktop GNU/Linux has become more popular in recent years it seems to me there has been something of a decline in *nixy technical quality and character and an undermining of FS values - at least in some quarters.

On the other hand, you don't want to claim that that system is really 100% free, and you do want there to be some motivation to get that last 10% freed (or replaced).\r\n\r\nEverything after that is a value judgment and therefore highly subjective.\r\n\r\nWhen discussing distributions' choices, we do have to draw some kind of line between our own opinions about those values, and the wide range of valid choices that we might not agree with (which is a lot larger). That's where \"tolerance\" comes in, and without it, there's no \"freedom\" for us to be defending.\r\n\r\nIn the article, I've tried to express both my own (extreme) frustration with the choices of three package maintainers and also my tolerance for their point of view.

    body: "Those are all valid points. Responding to some of them (out of order):\r\n\r\nIn point of fact, I have created Debian packages before. I ran into problems with policy and the upstream package's archaic design and licensing, though, so none have so far been admissible to Debian's archive. At some point, I'm sure I will attempt it again with a less crotchety software package -- perhaps one of my own.\r\n\r\nI also _do_ run a number of testing or unstable packages at need. Sadly, I can tell you from experience that \"You can always downgrade to earlier packages should something not work for a few days\" is often untrue (there are quite a few ways to hose your system when packages are out of synch, and APT does not like downgrades). Running such a system on a work-critical desktop workstation is _not_ a very good idea. I've had to do a complete re-install on more than one occasion because of such problems. Not something you want to do on a deadline.\r\n\r\nActually, I _don't_ run `popularity-contest`. Call it paranoia, if you like, but even conceding that, it doesn't really measure the relevant metrics here. Satisfaction with the state of a given package is not highly correlated to how many people have it installed or even how frequently they use it.\r\n\r\n\"Working with the maintainer of the package\" is unpromising in each of these cases, as the article describes. That is precisely the point of choosing these particular problems. This is not a matter of reporting a bug or of providing a patch. Each of these has a simple solution that the packager has _rejected_.\r\n\r\nThat's because they have a very different idea about what the \"right\" thing to do is. These are not failures of understanding, they are _disagreements_. I know that, because I've already read the bug reports.\r\n\r\nThe interesting problem is that with the way Debian is set up, that's the end of the story. Once the packager kills the idea, it just doesn't get done. Solving _that_ problem is the focus of my post. Unfortunately I don't have a nice, canned, well-defined answer to how to do it. Just some brainstorming ideas.\r\n\r\nHere's what I meant about \"simple solutions\":\r\n\r\n* `ttf-thryomanes` should've been kept despite the rendering bug. It's better to have the font with the bug than to lose it entirely.\r\n\r\n* `libft-perl` should not have been removed, because `defoma`, a critical infrastructure package needed it. Once the patch is applied to move `defoma-hints` to a new library, it can be removed, but not before.\r\n\r\n* `wacom-tools` should have included the configuration tool, despite the packager's objection to the TCL dependency. TCL could've been listed as a \"recommended\" or \"suggested\" package rather than a \"required\" package for those who don't want to get \"all covered in TCL.\" Once a replacement tool is created, _then_ the package can migrate to that, not before.\r\n\r\nNone of these decisions would've required any real patches, they're just configuration choices in creating the packages. This isn't a matter of insufficient labor. It's a matter of someone specifically blocking these actions because they disagree with them.\r\n\r\nWe're talking about subjective value judgments here, not objective \"bugs.\"\r\n\r\nThe answer to that is not more bug reports (that's just repeating the same action expecting different results). The answer is a system that creates more responsiveness to user needs and/or more choice in what packages to install. That _does_ involve a labor issue (how to make those competing packages), which would need to be solved by either decreasing the difficulty of making packages or increasing the incentives for doing it.\r\n\r\nAll challenging problems, but worth thinking about if we want a better, more usable system.\r\n"

Or do I have to settle for an inferior general purpose distribution that can't do either one well?\r\n\r\nMaybe it would be better if there were some intermediate level of complexity -- incomplete distributions or collections of packages that serve specific niche users.\r\n\r\nAs for the conflicts that might occur, it might be desirable to include some kind of virtualization that would allow packages to run in different library dependency environments (perhaps by manipulating paths or even using \"fake root\" environments). Alternatively, greater use of static-linking might be made as needed to resolve conflicts."
