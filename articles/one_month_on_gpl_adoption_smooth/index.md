  I recently read the discussion on  the [GCC  development mailing list](http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc/2007-07/threads.html) related to GCC's transition  to [GPLv3](http://fsfeurope.org/projects/gplv3/).  Despite generating 172 emails, the transition was quite smooth  actually.

  I decided to read about GCC's transition because I wanted to  investigate a (false) claim which Slashdot featured on their front  page.  Slashdot's story, which I now know to be complete rubbish,  claimed that  [key  GCC developers were talking about forking GCC](http://linux.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/07/23/0446204).

  Actually, they mostly discussed version numbers, as well as the  copyright status  of [code  written by scripts](http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc/2007-07/msg00573.html), and  of [World  War II photographs](http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc/2007-07/msg00566.html), etc.

  About the version number, DJ Delorie argued against bumping the  version number up to 4.3.0 for the new licence  because [Slashdot  might print a negative story](http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc/2007-07/msg00430.html) about GCC 4.3.0 not having the  features previously scheduled for that version number.  Which is  pretty funny in hindsight because the developers finally agreed not  to bump the number up to 4.3.0, and Slashdot still printed a  negative story.  It seems there's no getting around the fact that  Slashdot just loves controversy, even when it means creating  anti-free-software FUD.

  So, in  review, [Samba's  GPLv3 transition went well](http://news.samba.org/announcements/samba_gplv3/).  Then  [SugarCRM ditched their  custom licence and moved to GPLv3](http://lwn.net/Articles/242968/),  which, [as I  said](http://www.linuxdevices.com/articles/AT7188273245.html), is one way in which GPLv3 tackles licence proliferation.  And now GCC  and [286 other  projects](http://gpl3.palamida.com:8080/index.jsp) have made the transition, according to Palamida's GPLv3  counter.  It seems that GPLv3 transitions are going quite smoothly.

  In fact, it seems that many commentators have been surprised (and  some have surely been disappointed) by the lack of major problems.  There is a vacuum of bad press, which is why Slashdot has resorted  to printing hallucinations,  and [InformationWeek  can only publish bad news by inventing it](http://fsfe.org/en/fellows/ciaran/ciaran_s_free_software_notes/misleading_informationweek_gplv3_article).  All in all, I'd  chalk that down as a success for the eighteen months of hard work  that was the GPLv3 consultation process.
