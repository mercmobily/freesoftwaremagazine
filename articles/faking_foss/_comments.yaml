    body: "You are wrong to assume the gif and jpeg formats to be non-free. Both formats were declared free to implement without having to pay any license fees by their creators, Compuserve and JPEG respectively. I guess you wanted to refer to the legal troubles both formats suffered from patent trolling.\r\n\r\nGIF was troubled by Unisys having a patent on the LZW compression technique used in the format. That patent expired in 2003 [1]. JPEG was having trouble by Forgent claiming to have a patent on parts of the standard. However, that patent was invalidated in May 2006 by the USTPO on grounds of prior art. Furthermore, the patent expired in October 2006 [2]. JPEG has always said their standards were free to implement for everyone [3].\r\n\r\nIt is true that the threat of submarine patents still exist for gif and jpeg, but then they exist for vorbis, png, theora etc. just as well. There could always be a company hiding in the dark but eventually coming out to claim that they have a patent encumbering any of those \"free\" formats.\r\n\r\nMany Free Software programs implement gif and jpeg, you don't have to rely on non-free software in order to utilise them. Therefore, your criticism and recommendation not to use these formats is wrong. While it might be a better idea morally to use formats like png and vorbis, as they were created specifically to avoid patent encumbrance, there's nothing wrong with using free standards like gif and jpeg. One would recommend to prefer png over gif on technical grounds, but jpeg is virtually the only popular lossy image compression format Free Software implementations are available for. If you want people not to use it you should point them to a technically viable alternative first.\r\n\r\n[1] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gif#Unisys_and_LZW_patent_enforcement\r\n[2] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jpeg#Potential_patent_issues\r\n[3] http://www.jpeg.org/newsrel1.html\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nincinerator@fsfe.org"

And I would like to unfortunately put our hypocrisy on the table. We're actually pushing quite hard to be totally FOSS, but have run into a couple of hopefully temporary roadblocks. This has caused us to use mp3 for now. The issues are as follows (and we would love to hear from anyone who can give us alternatives or solutions): \r\nWe need to be able to stream our content and not have it available for download. This is due to copyright restrictions and our broadcast license for tracks that we have ascap/bmi licenses for. This is basically commercially available music that people are familiar with. At present we use Flash as the web-embedded player of choice. Unfortunately flash only supports mp3. Hence our releasing most of the audio for download at our site in mp3 format. Internal to KRUU we're mostly Ogg, but allow people to bring in their shows as aif or mp3 (because we allow people to pre-record their interview shows, and those on a Mac seem to have it a bit tough to use Ogg right now).\r\nWe're on a bit of a prostletyzing mission, but we would prefer to do it in a way that's comfortable for everyone. The cool thing is that we have over 80 show hosts who come into our station, and use our Ubuntu-based system, and we've not had one complaint thus far.\r\nHopefully in the next couple of months we'll be able to get to be \"truly\" Free software based."

I'm sure the developers of those formats have done significant research in order to make sure that there aren't any patents related to those formats that could be a threat. However, with thousands of patents issued every year, you can never be sure. No matter what you do, there's always the risk of a submarine patent causing trouble.

    body: "<cite>\"We need to be able to stream our content and not have it available for download.\"</cite>\r\nThat's technically impossible with digital technology as such. As long as you make a copy of those bits and bytes you call music and transfer it to another computer over a network, one can always make a copy of that data stream and save it on the disk.\r\n\r\nThe approach of using a flash-based web application and a non-free data format is naive. You assume that this forms any kind of protection from making illegitimate copies, but it doesn't, it just makes it a wee bit more difficult. A program can always eavesdrop into the data stream at any point between the data arriving at the client's computer over the network and the data stream being converted into analogue audio signals in the client computer's sound card.\r\n\r\nOne of the explicit design goals, and it hottest selling arguments, of digital technology is that  making identical copies can be done with virtually no effort. Copy protection for digital data is an oxymoron, it simply cannot be done in the long run.\r\n\r\nOf course that doesn't save you from the licensing trouble with your music. The licensor might be happy enough with the fact that your choice of software and audio format makes it somewhat more difficult to save a copy of the streamed music to disk. The licensor is probably a wee bit naive about the technical details, as well.\r\n\r\nThere are a couple of approaches you can follow:\r\n- Do not use non-free music, at all. Only use music you can legally stream over the internet.\r\n- Blank out non-free music when it's on the air, so that the FM radio signal has it but not the digital audio stream you make available to the internet.\r\n- Add a digital watermark to the audio stream. While this won't protect you from making copies you might be able to trace the person who spreads illegitimate copies. Those watermarks might be spotted and removed before the copy gets distributed, though.\r\n- Follow my argument about the fallacy of digital copy protection and use free software and free formats regardless. If the licensor allows you to use mp3 and whatnot, it doesn't make a technical difference if you moved to vorbis and free streaming software. Either ways, the client's always able to make a copy."

They are a part of the independent, 5 station non-profit <a href=\"http://www.pacifica.org\">Pacifica</a> network, which I was on the national board of directors from 2000-3. They run an ogg stream at http://aud1.kpfa.org:8090/kpfa.ogg. I would pick their brains as much as possible on the technical issues of streaming, etc.\r\n\r\nAs for the downloading issue, you can't prevent that. If it can get to your ears (or eyes) it can be recorded. Remember recording songs off the radio with your cassette player? R U that old ;-)\r\n\r\nI would say just set your operating standards to require the use of ogg files for your hosts. If they are producing pre-recorded shows there are free tools (such as <a href=\"http://audacity.sourceforge.net/\">Audacity</a>) that run on Linux and Windows they can use.\r\n\r\nI would also suggest that you could require/suggest people use open music, eg that released under the <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/\">Creative Commons</a> license. (They have an article on KRUU on their website there.) There is a growing repository of music released under this license. There is also a growing list of music released as ogg files.\r\n\r\nYou can also require people who have wmv files convert them to <a href=\"http://flac.sourceforge.net/\">flac</a> (Free Lossles Audio Codec) files, which will be smaller, but still preserve the full audio fidelity of the original file.\r\n\r\nAs for mp3, etc, well, just use them if there are really no alternatives. Whatever legal issues you think you have to deal with you have to deal with anyway. It's the content that may have some restrictions on it, not the file format.\r\n\r\nThe key thing is to set standards, and explain to the community and hosts the rationale of the whats and whys, and provide the tools and resources so that people can easily comply with the standards. Education is they key here. I would assume you are already providing training to people on the various aspects of radio show production, so incorporate these aspects into it.\r\n\r\nFinally, I would suggest you check out <a href=\"http://www.campware.org/en/camp/campcaster_news\">Campcaster</a>, if you aren't aware of it.  This could greatly facilitate people not having to physically come to your studios to deliver their audio  content, and would allow you to train a bevy of people who could operate the station 24/7.\r\n\r\nAs Yoda said, use the FOSS Luke, use the FOSS...\r\n\r\nJabari\r\n"

However, we actually want people to physically be at the station for their shows - it's a totally different feeling to be in the broadcast booth, live on the air, than to pre-record. It has worked out for us quite well, and we are currently running a 24/7 operation.\r\n\r\nOver the next few weeks we'll be working on updating many of our processes (as we stabilize). So I suspect things like Ogg streaming and downloading will start becoming more visible.\r\n\r\nBTW, on the CC-music note.
