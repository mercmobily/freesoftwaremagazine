I would let them know the option exists and let them decide.\r\nThat said I have had too many late night call-outs to friends who have purchased Dell PCs and it's not working. Dell support is appalling IMHO and it is for this reason that I would not actually recommend buying Dell at all - let alone a GNU/Linux option.\r\n\r\nRyan"

    body: "I often hear that people think Macs are nicer for new users. I can not agree with that. I think Apple is VERY successful in making people THINK that they are easier. i think that old Macs like from MacOs till MacOS 7 where really easy but then it got really messy. And then MacOS X is not really an elegant desktop. Also you have to decide what you want to use - Mac with MacOS means fewer free software or more trouble with free software. A Mac is ok for people who only want to use Photoshop. ok, Macs are now also kind of Unix but from my experience doing things that are simple on Linux just do not work on a Mac or you need to find out - or the OS stands in the way.\r\n\r\nApple had some nice in the past like the magnetic power plug and they are very courageous in doing things no other big company would do. But I still do not believe that Macs are simpler. (btw. I was a Mac user 1995-1998).\r\n\r\n-- \r\nThilo Pfennig\r\nBlog: http://flinux.wordpress.com/"

I started using computers when Macintosh bought out their first Apple Mac, which is probably older than most of your readers. I have gone through more computers, systems and programs than I care to count.  Three crashes later, (the latest happening last week despite all the anti-virus programs, updates, sweeps, anti-spyware, defenders and malicious software removal tools etc. that I make use of), I am finally determined to stop this ridiculous buying into the Bill Gates world of subterfuge and self- regenerating profits.  Hopefully my cautionary tale will encourage others to take a second look at what they are letting themselves in for if they stick with the omnipotent Gates.'

    body: "At least to most of the people I come into contact with. They are people who use their computers for web, email, light office use, and light photo stuff. Now assuming Dell is going to be smart and verify the hardware will work out of the box, then there should be very few things that will prevent this person from making a smooth switch. Easy WiFi and full graphics support would be a must!\r\nThe \"problem areas\" in my opinion will be the Quicken/Quickbooks and MSMoney users that will refuse to switch to something like GNUcash and things like shockwave, which for some stupid reason is not available on Linux, but is on Windows and Mac. There are still some online games that run on shockwave, and asking people to install the Win32 Firefox under Wine and install shockwave that way is not a good workaround\r\nSo it is very important you point out these things before they place their order! It is important people understand these \"shortcomings\" are not the fault of Linux or Dell, but that the hardware and software manufacturers provide drivers and software that are cross-platform.\r\nI hope with a major OEM such as Dell getting on board with a popular Linux distro such as Ubuntu, Linux on the desktop will be ready for Prime Time! We should see it in much more widespread use - then the rest will naturally fall into place. Who knows -- I know we wont see MSmoney for Linux in the foreseeable future, but Intuit might jump on board. Maybe Adobe will get the hint as well.\r\n"
