The role of OSX (and in particular using BSD as a base) was the next step, the necessary move for the company in the new millennium. UNIX offers things that were not imaginable with the old classic Apple OS. \r\n\r\nNow, back to Linux. Proposing to \"fork the kernel\" and packing it up in a nice package, is not going to bring you anywhere. Who exactly is going to do this? Which company? A new startup? In principle you may be right, however competing out of nowhere with giants such as MS, Apple, Dell, HP... is going to kill you right away if you are not one of those companies. That was why people demanded Dell to preinstall Linux in first place. \r\n\r\nBy the way, you can get Linux preinstalled in a nice package with everything working: \"System 76\" sells laptop with Ubuntu. Nice package. Market share: 0."

But feranick is 100% right...you just can't make it and expect people to choose it.  There would have to be a HUGE marketing campaign to convince people that MegaOS IS better then Windows and Apple.  I'm not sure that is really ever going to happen...not in 'businesses making money' terms.  If it was that simple we'd have seen one of the big boys do it by now.  Don't get me wrong, your idea has a lot of merit to it...but whoever did it would basically have to run everything like apple (control hardware specs and lock in software companies).  At that point, what differentiates you from Apple?  Besides the fact they can run Adobe software and MegaOS couldn't?  \r\n\r\nBut i've wondered for a long time if a local 'white box' shop could actually make money selling Linux boxes and support for them.  Instead of competing against the 'big boys' you would be competing against other small 'white box' companies.  Linux is GREAT for computers that are only going to be doing word processing, email, and other basic tasks (not that they couldn't do other things) and mom and pop business servers of course. Your marketing budget alone would be a lot smaller and you could sell it just off the free (as in beer) software and lack of adware/viruses alone.  If \"White Box Linux\" wanted to take it a step further they could even keep their own repository with software precomplied to work with \"White Box Linux\" boxes.    \"White Box Linux shops would just have to make sure that they could get a steady supply of high grade parts that work with Linux.  \r\n\r\nAnd if the idea actually worked, there would be no reason it couldn't be franchised out.  Once franchised you could then get the ball rolling for your ideas to pressure manufacturers to support linux."

    hostname: 82.153.26.195
    created: '1174659126'
    body: "Another route to the desktop for Linux - hide it!\r\n\r\nTake each device you'd have in a typical PC, stick each in its own box along with a processor, ram and some storage, and have each device talk to the others over a well specified, high-speed/low-latency network (something like PCI Express or Infiniband, possibly even SpaceWire).  One or more 'Kernel' boxes (with cpu, ram and storage) do the 'operating system' job of co-ordinating access to the devices and user administration.  Linux in this context becomes the device driver model, internal to each 'device' and not encountered (much) by the end user.  In short, turn every expansion card into a consumer device and get them talking to each other.  Even shorter, a truly modular PC.  I've compiled some notes on such a system below, apologies for any duplication, they're cut and pasted from old notes along with some new typing.  Also apologies to anyone who finds this boring, obvious or ludicrous.  Wrote most of this down around a year ago, got about 5000 unordered droning words on the subject if anyone's actually interested.\r\n\r\nDisadvantages of this approach include:\r\n\r\nCost - turning each device into a standalone computer will obviously add overhead to the cost of each device.  Sufficient (significant) units would need to be shifted to lower this margin to an acceptable level.  Looking at the vast numbers of cheap embedded devices in existence today it should be possible to acheive this, though even in the best case a 'boxed' device will always cost more than a naked expansion card.  The greatest cost will likely be in the interconnect between the boxes, switches for Infiniband are helluva expensive, again with sufficient bulk this could be reduced (hopefully).\r\n\r\nLatency - the 'bus' of the computer is (needs to be) effectively replaced by a high bandwidth, low-latency network.  The best (most expensive) network technologies today have sufficiently low latency and massive amounts of bandwidth so really this particular disadvantage is part of the cost problem detailed above.\r\n\r\nPrettiness - interconnecting all these devices will involve a non-trivial amount of cabling.  Hiding this, and making the boxes look pretty individually as well as when 'combined' will be a major design challenge.\r\n\r\nStarting from scratch - though most of this system can be derived from existing hardware and software there would be a large degree of starting from scratch.  Inter-device messaging, a new programming model and interoperability with existing systems.  This isn't entitled a not so modest proposal for nothing :)  In fairness, a lot of hardware seems to be moving in this direction anyway, and a lot of the current compsci research in distributed/parallel computing is directly relevant to such a system.  Interoperability could be achieved directly with lots of code hacking, or through installing an 'OS Box', basically another device that internally runs the operating system needed for a particular application and interfaces with the rest of the system in the same way as other devices.\r\n\r\nAdvantages of this approach include:\r\n\r\nDevice isolation - each deviced is isolated from all the others in the system, they can only interact over a well-established network interface.  Each device advertises its services (via the kernel box).  Other devices can access these services, again authenticated and managed by the kernel box.  Device manufacturers ship their goodies as a single standalone box, and they of course have full control over the internals of said box, there are no other devices in the box (apart from the networking hardware and storage) to cause conflicts.  Each device can be optimised by its manufacturer, and there's the upside that the 'drivers' for the device are actually part of the device.  Testing a device is simpler, no need to worry about possible hardware or software conflicts, as long as the device can talk over the interconnect, things should be cool.  Note that another consequence of this is that internally the device can use any 'operating system' and software the manufacturers (or the tinkering user) needs to do the job, as well as whatever internal hardware they need (though of course all devices would need to implement the networking protocol).  Consequently integrating new hardware ideas become somewhat less painful too.  I think I'm right in saying most problems in PCs today come down to problematic hardware or software interactions, the majority of which can be removed by isolating the hardware like this.  Additional benefits of isolation include individual cooling solutions on a per device basis and better per device power management.\r\n\r\nNo driver deprecation - as long as the network protocol connecting the boxes does not change the drivers for the device will never become obsolete due to OS changes.  If the network protocol does change, more than likely only the networking portion of the device 'driver' will need an update.  Worst case scenario is if the network 'interface' (ie connector) changes.  This would necessitate a new device with the appropriate connection or modification to the current device.\r\n\r\nNo device deprecation - devices generally fall out of use for two reasons - a) lack of driver support in the latest version of the operating system, and b) no physical connector for the device in the latest boxes.  This problem would not exist because as mentioned in 'No driver deprecation' above the driver is always 'with' the device and can always be connected through the standard inter-device protocol.  Old devices can be kept on the system to share workload with newer devices, or the box can be unplugged and given to someone who needs it, the new user can just plug the box into their system and start using the device, much better than the 'current' system of farting around trying to find drivers and carrying naked expansion cards around and stuffing them into already overcrowded cases.  As users upgrade their machines it is often the case that some of their hardware is not compatible with the upgrades.  For example, upgrading the CPU in a machine often means a new motherboard.  If a new standard for magnetic storage surfaces, very often this requires different connectors to those present on a user’s motherboard, thus necessitating a chain of upgrades to use the new device.  When a device is no longer used in a PC it is generally the case that it is sold, discarded or just left to rot somewhere.  Obtaining device drivers for such devices becomes impossible as they are phased out at the operating system and hardware level, and naked expansion cards are so very easily damaged.  In this system there would be no need to remove an old device, even if you have obtained another device that does the same job.  The old device could remain in the system and continue to do its job for any applications that need it, and taking some load from the new device where it can.  As long as there is versioning on the device APIs there is no chance of interference due to each device having self-contained device drivers.   Devices can be traded easily, they come with their own device drivers so can just be slotted into a new base unit and are less likely to be damaged in transit. \r\n\r\nSecurity - security is a big issue and one which all operating systems struggle to fulfil for various reasons.   While most OSs are now reasonably secure keeping intruders out and user data safe is a constant battle.  This system would potentially have several advantages in the area of security; the fact that the Kernel is a self-contained solution, probably running in firmware means overwriting the operating system code would be very difficult if not impossible, and would likely require physical access to the machine.  For the various devices, vendors are free to build in whatever security measures they see fit without worrying about the effect on the rest of the system.  They could be password protected, keyed to a particular domain or whatever to prevent their use in an unauthorised system.  Additional measures such as tamper proofing on the container could ensure that it would be extremely difficult to steal data without direct access to the machine and user account information.  Of course there are several areas of security (DoS attacks for example) where this system would be no better off than conventional systems, though it may suffer less as the network device under attack could be more easily isolated from the rest of the system..   It is also likely that a new range of attacks specific to this systems would appear, so security for will be as much a concern as it is on other systems and should be incorporated tightly from the start.\r\n\r\nDevice installation – even with the advent of easily opened cases, jumperless configuration and matching plug shapes/colours, installing hardware remains a headache on most systems.  With for example a new graphics card, the system must be powered down and the case opened, the old card removed and the new one seated.  Then follows a reboot and detection phase followed by the installation (if necessary) of the device driver.  Most systems have made headway in this process, but things still do go wrong on a regular basis, and often the system must still be powered down while new hardware is installed, and if things go wrong it can be very difficult to work out what the exact problem is.   By turning each device into a consumer device, this system would allow for hot swapping of any device.  Once power and networking are plugged into the device (this could happen mechanically when the device is slid into the base unit), the device would automatically boot and be discovered/integrated into the 'kernel'.  No device driver installation would be necessary as all the logic for driving the device is internal to the device.  If the Kernel is unable to speak to the device over the network this would generally signify a connectivity problem, a power problem or a fault with the device itself.  Because devices are wrappers for 'actual' devices there is no need to touch the device's circuitry, so removing risk of damage as can happen with typical expansion cards and also removing the danger of electric shocks to the user.\r\n\r\nStorage Clutter – One thing which I personally hate about operating systems in general is the ridiculous number of files visible to the user.  Windows and Linux are particularly bad for this, with most or all of the operating system visible to the user whether or not the user can interact with those files.  They slow down searches, make it difficult to pinpoint what one is looking for and just look generally messy.  In this system all the operating system files are hid from the user inside device boxes, there will rarely if ever be a need to touch those files except during upgrades or if the user specifically wants to hack a device.  The only ‘files’ a user should see are their own data files on storage devices and a list of Applications/APIs that the user can access.  This would make for a cleaner, more usable system with less chance that the user’s actions could bring the OS down, and without the need for file protection daemons consuming resources in the background.\r\n\r\nWould love to write a lot more but this may be abusively long for posting on the comments page."

The Linux kernel has thousands of active patch submitters - the high quality of the Linux kernel is precisely because so many brains group around the thing at the same time.\r\n\r\nNext is the operating system itself. Where would all the packages come from? Who would support packages for this fork? What's the benefit for community maintained software if they need a special computer to run it on? Or do you suggest it go the tired way of OS X, where you have to go to websites to find and install software instead of something sane like a single up to date and audited database of software like Linux distributions enjoy now? Yuk. Been there done that.\r\n\r\nTo propose forking Linux is silliness. There are already companies doing just fine selling machines with a popular distribition of Linux pre-installed. Forking is a completely unneccessary (see http://system76.com as an example of the right idea).\r\n\r\nMoreso, it'd be simply stupid to go the direction of Apple. Apple have a very particular market and through their marriage of hardware and software are not in a position to grow with any where near the rapidity of Linux. We're really seeing this now - a massive uptake of Linux on the desktop in the past year in the educational and governmental sectors. Closer to home I often meet Windows or OS X users that have switched - or are in the process of trying out - Linux (admittedly Ubuntu in nearly every case). \r\n\r\nPeople increasingly want to work with what they have, not follow the pattern of organised obsolescence that proprietary OS's like OS X and Vista shovel onto users. This is where the portability of Linux finally proves to be paying off and this portability is soley due to the fact Linux is not in the game of selling hardware. Linux (as though it was singlular thing) doesn't have to 'compete' with these hungry American corporations at all; Linux is a public resource - like a public library or park. Arguably Linux doesn't even need a 'market' to grow - Linux grows with every user that get's sick of the relationship of 'renting' their operating system, sick of the banality of using an OS that doubles as a shop front.\r\n\r\nFor such a young OS, Linux is doing just fine. Look at Ubuntu - 8 million new and active users in a few years and growing exponentially. The French government is switching to Ubuntu FFS, schools across continental Europe madly installing the thing. What more could you want?\r\n\r\nTo 'fork Linux' is to misunderstand both the value of Linux, how it improves and why it is adopted. Aside from that a fork sounds like a boring and expensive waste of time. Best of luck."

Suddenly, the prospect of FREE software, that can be automatically updated everyday, with the next, promised, FREE full version update, only six months away, and while using their current hardware, will become a very attractive proposition to a newly impoverished populace.\r\n\r\nThe difference between M$ 'inventing' a bit of software, and the open source community 'releasing' their free software, is like, between two different planets.\r\n\r\nI wouldn't have it any other way."

Unless the company making your wireless chipset actively and legally allows for Linux driver developers to read their specification, how the hell are they supposed to write a driver?\r\n\r\nIf your wireless card isn't supported by Linux, then you have four choices: \r\n\r\n1. Don't use Linux. \r\n\r\n2. Contact the wireless card manufacturer and tell them that you'd like to use it with Linux using another means of connectivity in the meantime. \r\n\r\n3. Buy a machine with one of the many chipsets supported well by Linux (like most of the Intel wireless cards). Check on this page first: http://leenooks.com.\r\n\r\n4. Spend EUR20.00 and get an alternative wireless card, say one that fits into your PCMCIA port.\r\n\r\nKernel developers aren't telepathic. They can only develop with what they know, the rest is guesswork - which only works some of the time.\r\n\r\nHTH\r\n\r\n"

First of all if it was as easy as putting a hardware together with a few drivers inside a nice box I think linux would have done that a long time ago, one thing to remember is that companies will not give up there codes just because your a pretty boy and you want the best for the enduser, this is the last thing they are tinking about, all they want is money and if you plan to setup a PC with everything for the ondemand of todays users and a with a "beautifull box" I really don''t think that for less than 4 or 5 hundred dollars your going to find it. Now if you really know about linux history, most linux distros where ment to be run on old hardware, therefor, not making you spend any money at all to have a good system. It''s been like a year and a half that linux has been on the top of the game when it comes to home use and a hole bunch of years more for the business use. I''ll give you an advice UBUNTU for the Gnome and SUSE for KDE or Gnome I thing your be surprised of a lots of things and a nother thing is that the walwreens perfect world is only a tv comercial this stuff don''t happen in real life...'

    body: 'One more thing - if the OS is meant to work somehow after one year from purchasing without being a bottleneck of the whole system it should be considered to provide "packages on demand" service. The assumption is that new user will not be able to recompile the kernel each time he buys a new  HW. Instead of providing him a kernel that works with everything (even if it''s possible) he should be able to send his equipment configuration to the service and receive the "installation form" of a module that he can use within a minute. This is what has made Windows successful - ability to be extensible with the external devices. Once there is an option to easily modify the kernel, or any old tool, or an application then the MegaOS can really make a difference. '

You should base it on some distribution with auto-update.  Ubuntu/Debian have a small applet that you just klick on when it see that there is new updates.  You should prob. only have a subset of Ubuntu/Debian packages that is tested to work.\r\nIf customers want more, they should either install it themself, or change distribution."
