    body: "Internet Explorer still holds more than 50% of the usage share: It's still the most used web browser! The combined usage share of other browser is less than the IE usage share. Firefox, Chrome and Safari hasn't killed IE yet. And the main problem isn't killing IE, it is killing ALL proprietary browsers, opera and safari included (remember that safari is only partially free software, parts of it are proprietary).\r\n\r\nIf you combine the usage share of all free software browsers they're still around 40% which is really good, only 10% to be the majority of web browsers!\r\n\r\nBut please, don't be claiming that IE is killed until it's usage share drops bellow 50%, or even better: it drops bellow the combined market share of free software browsers."

    body: "To be strictly accurate, it's not IE that's dead, but rather the IE monopoly.\r\n\r\nIE is and will probably continue to be a strong contender with a respectable market share for a long time to come. Probably right up until Microsoft abandons it. But of course, that is somewhat likely, since the real purpose of IE seems to have been to maintain monopoly control, not to provide a good browser.\r\n\r\nThe good news really is that that tired old argument -- \"well we have to support IE because 'nearly all' of the users are using it\" -- just isn't going to fly. Telling the boss you're just going to ignore 40% of the market starts to get pretty untenable.\r\n\r\nHopefully that will mean more emphasis on standards-based web design.\r\n\r\nBut it's not all goodness and light yet. The United States' Internal Revenue Service introduced online fillable forms that rely on Microsoft Silverlight to work. We got them to work with Moonlight, but it wasn't pretty. My wife is still cussing the damage that did to her system (apparently she ran into a large number of package conflicts).\r\n"

    body: "The real litmus test here is surely when the \"average user\" (by which I mean a home user who has purchased an OEM PC) distinguishes between the Internet as a service (e.g. www) and Internet Explorer as a product through which you can use that service. That monopoly in my experience starts to shift as people begin to use the web more and once they make the distinction they are more likely to dump IE. Prior to that they hear of IE's bad reputation and largely let it slide because I think they don't really get the point. This of course is the point of monopoly, to make your product ubiquitously associated with a service or market. It ends with the adoption of a product as the name for the market or service (Hoover, Biro, Google)\r\n\r\nThe good news as you say is that this seems to be a situation where the tide is turning. Like many I have a group of friends and relatives that I offer IT support to. More of those are now beginning to pro-actively ask whether they should be using Chrome or Firefox as they've heard they are safer. I should say that most of them are quite surprised to discover I installed Firefox for them a while back and they have been using it without realising. I did tell them they just didn't grasp what it meant.\r\n\r\n--\r\nEquitas IT Solutions - fairness, quality, freedom  \r\nhttp://www.equitasit.co.uk"
