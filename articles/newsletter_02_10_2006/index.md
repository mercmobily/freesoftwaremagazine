Hi readers and subscribers, and welcome to Free Software Magazine’s fortnightly newsletter - keeping you up to date with what’s going on with us, and free software... enjoy!


# General announcements

Our last newletter said that if you wanted the Issue 14 in PDF format versus on paper, you would have to wait 30 days. But due to our delays actually releasing the paper issue, the good news is, [Issue 14 is NOW AVAILABLE in PDF](http://www.freesoftwaremagazine.com/issues/issue_014)! Two weeks earlier than anticipated! Happy reading!

Please help spread the word about its release. If you can, [Digg it!](http://digg.com/linux_unix/Issue_14_of_Free_Software_Magazine_released).
