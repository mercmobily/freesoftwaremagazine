Do you want to write for Free Software Magazine?

At Free Software Magazine, we are always looking for new authors and wenow pay for articles (in books) thanks to our [sponsors](/sponsors/)!

At the moment, we are looking for user-orientated articles. Specifically, we are looking for _entry level_ articles on Linux and major GNU/Linux distros like “Ubuntu”.

The articles will need to be _very_ easy to follow. Something your mother would understand without too much effort (even if she doesn’t work as a software engineer for IBM...).

The articles should therefore avoid referring to the command line if at all humanly possible.

Here are some examples of articles from our wish list:


* Installing software using Synaptic Package Manager
* How to make Ubuntu look like [whatever]. Installing themes.
* Ubuntu Breezy and “root” (admin) users: the whole story
* I installed Ubuntu. Now what? Install a DVD player, codecs, etc.
* Setting up multimedia using Easy Ubuntu
* Configure a network with Ubuntu and Windows computers graphically
* Configure Evolution to read your emails
* RSS : Follow the updates of your preferred websites
* Manage your iPod
* Use Freenet, the secure and anonymous network

_[UPDATE: Most of these articles have already been assigned. However, they will give you an idea of what we are after!]_

For these articles, the “format” could be:


* What the article is about
* Where to get the necessary stuff—relevant sites
* How to do it, step by step
* What actually happened (in case of Synaptic, files got copied around the file system. Which ones? How? When? In case of Ubuntu themes, what copying the themes means and what a theme is made of
* Closing remarks
* Conclusion

If you have any proposals... please do contact us!

Bye,

Tony Mobily

Editor In Chief
