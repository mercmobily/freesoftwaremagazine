We pay our authors in books.\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>Comment from: maggie [Visitor]</strong>\r\n\r\n    2006-01-10 @ 13:40\r\n    I have been using ubuntu for a while and really like it. Writing an article sounds cool, but I don't think I can fulfil all the items on the wishlist.... esp since I don't use ipod... i use zen from creative hahaha but don't use it on ubuntu.. hmm..\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>Comment from: maggie [Visitor]</strong>\r\n\r\n    2006-01-10 @ 13:41\r\n    When is the deadline?\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>Comment from: Mark Luxton [Visitor]</strong>\r\n\r\n    2006-01-10 @ 14:49\r\n    I am a windows setup specialist. I am not a programmer but am a technician. I have installed and tried thousands of programs on Win3.11, 95b, 98se, 2000,& XP. I have become very impatient with software that \"lets you down\". I use a lot of free software and that led me to GNU/Linux. I have been using Ubuntu for only a few weeks and I thought I would be a good person to write of the difficulties and successes from the perspective of a new Linux user(with a rather high IQ), who knows what is nice in windows. I have been tourturing Ubuntu and installing every bit of software availiable, to see what is both intuitive, usefull, and capable--like the Gimp(very nice).\r\n    I also need books, especially for learning GNU/Linux. I am a person who has sacraficed being wealthy for having time to learn many many things. I prefer barter!\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>Comment from: caleb [Visitor]</strong>\r\n\r\n    2006-01-12 @ 01:08\r\n    Yes, ubuntu is a very nice distro for those beginning to use Linux, and those already familiar with another distro, but what about KDE. I've been using KDE for just about 6 years now since our Windows died, and I needed the family computer to work before my mom came home (HAHA). Could any of the articles feature KDE or its applications, I really love AmaroK, or something like installing Gaim with autopackage.\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>Comment from: Tony Mobily [Member]</strong>\r\n\r\n    2006-01-12 @ 01:24\r\n    Caleb: luckily, KDE users can use Kubuntu. When I say that we are after articles about Ubuntu, well, we mean Kubuntu and EdUbuntu as well!\r\n"
