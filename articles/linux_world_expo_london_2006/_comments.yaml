I recommend including names like that: famous as such people may be, we mostly know their names, not their faces (or I do, anyway).\r\n\r\n"

You may have considered the activity contrived, but the days of describing non-English culture as “Hung-a-boong-a” are well and truly passed, here in New Zealand at least.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if you're an ignorant child or a sheltered old man, but if I wasn't already a free software advocate your comments would taint my view of our community."

However, I also know that his comments did not mean to be insulting at all.\r\nI personally live in Australia, know some Maoris and would _love_ to see the Haka Dance. But, it's easy for me to appreciate it because of my location.\r\n\r\nBye!\r\n\r\nTony Mobily"

Therefore I am switching my thrust of speaking from pure evangelism to more practical matters of migration, integration, and extension of Free Software.\r\n\r\nI am \"only\" 57, and plan on being in the Free Software space for many more years.\r\n\r\nWarmest regards,\r\n\r\nmaddog"
