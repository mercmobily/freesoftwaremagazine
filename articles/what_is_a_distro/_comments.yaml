Both are Kernels which ar used for the same purpose, to be used in conjunction with other software in a distribution, a lot of this software comes w<ith a GNU licence. So BSD is like Linux a GNU Unix distribution. Most BSD's are free like Linux.\r\n\r\nOne exeption is ofcourse Mac OS X  but this non free distro comes with one great advantage. Installing & using Apple OS X is easier then using MS Windows & comes with all the advantages that Linux comes with. Gnu software & other linux applications are actively being ported to Mac OS X so i actually see no disadvantages if you compare it to other Linux/BSD distro's unless you count Apple hardware as a disadvantage.\r\n\r\nAnd we must not forget about Solaris which is free aswell for x86 hardware & come's as 2 distro's the Sun one & the free Solaris one. I haven't used any until now since i'm still using Apple's PwerPC hardware but as soon i'll switch to new Apple x86 hardware Solaris is going to be my 2nd OS so that i can compare it. Maybe someone with Solaris expierience can post here about it's comparisation to Linux / BSD / Unix"

On the other hand, if you're more accustomed to doing things on the command line or are a programmer, the differences are more obvious.\r\n\r\nOne of the main differences is that at least the five major BSDs (FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, DragonFly BSD, Mac OS X) are developed as whole operating systems, whereas GNU/Linux's development path is very disjointed. In a BSD, if a change is made to the kernel in order to add some functionality to a user-land program, it will happen immediately. Typically in the GNU/Linux world, additions to the kernel are only slowly adopted by the user-land programs (usually GNU) and take a more careful stance about being cross-platform (which can be a plus, if you like a certain OS's userland program over your native OS's; all the major BSDs include a GNU package to install, whereas porting BSD userland programs to Linux takes a bit more work)"

    body: "It tells the reader quite a lot if you start a text for newbies explaining the GNU and correcting their speaking (Linux -> GNU/Linux): you definitely care about the name, something which is *very* typical for the FLOSS people.\r\nOf course, I do understand the reasons to do so, and I would like to add some more comments:\r\n\r\nAs we all know, it must be X/K/GNU/Linux - or maybe X/M/G/GNU/Linux. With simply using GNU/Linux you rip off the people of the X project, the KDE project, Mozilla and Gnome (the first name is for pure KDE users, the second one for Gnome users). Also, in these days an A for Apple or Avahi would be appropriate, too. Everything else is just ripping off other peoples work.\r\nAnd: who are *you* that *you* can say it is ok to stop at the GNU and to not include X? I mean, an X and a slahs is even less than three letters and a slash. Also, it sounds cooler!. Yes, GNU is nice, but almost no one besides a lost group of geeks would use the entire OS without X, while there are distributions out there compiled with other compilers than GCC. And, yes, I know RMS says it is ok to stop after GNU - of course he says because then he is already in the game.\r\nTherefore the best would be X/.../Linux, spoken \"X-slash-three-dash-slash-Linux\" - I think it is even more catching than \"GNU-slash-Linux\", and it shows that there is much more!\r\nAlso, please keep in mind that GNU/Linux is explicitly *not* supposed to be pronounced \"GNU-Linux\" because that would imply that Linux is a GNU project - which it isn't.\r\n\r\nPlease, correct this in your article by writing the appropriate shortcuts, depending on the distribution! Also, train the readers on the correct reading! It is very necessary, but I'm totally sure that if we make this part clear very early the people will adopt to the OS better and more quickly. And they will definitely don't mind about such an important topic as a naming controversy!\r\n\r\nAlso, I do like it that you do not point out any reasons why you still could write Linux: all arguments for Linux and against X/.../GNU/Linux don't count!\r\nEveryone knows that the term \"Operating System\" is clearly defined and not to question at all. And everyone knows that you cannot name two things with the same name. Imagine we would have other things named Linux, like an Asteroid, or a brand of laundry detergent or anything else!\r\n\r\n\r\nI leave it to you to find any kind of humour in the part above.\r\nI really do think that the FLOSS community destroys very much by fighting about the names mainly against each other instead of accepting the common use of words - its hard to change such things, and most of the time you can only do this with oppression. And again: why GNU and not X?\r\nAnd yes, I saw too much harm done by people insisting on GNU/Linux instead of first talking to other people about the general idea. Much too much harm.\r\n\r\nAnyway, enough about that, here are some content problems I had with your article:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>\"free software programmers [...] don’t get paid when people buy their code\" - while you are right in the first place it also suggests that most FLOSS developers don't have a fixed job. That's a common mistake, because everyone simply believes it, but no one can prove it. In fact, a study (by Benno Luthiger Stoll, sadly in German only) bout the motivation of developers who hosted their projects on sourceforge (keep in mind that this excludes all large projects which are typically founded and backed by companies!) revealed that one third of the developers are paid for their work. And these 33% do more than 40 % of the work on sourceforge!</li>\r\n<li>Why include Xandros? There are enough valuable alternatives you haven't mentioned (Mandriva, Suse) which are suitable for beginners - Xandros as a negative example just confuses beginners!</li>\r\n<li>If you have the need to write a bit about distributions which include paying for stuff, write about SLES and RHEL - they are certified enterprise stuff, and it is clear where the extra money you pay goes to (you can *rely* on the certifications and support, for example).</li>\r\n<li>Technical detail mistake: Ubuntu comes with a Live CD as well, this is not an outstanding Mepis thing.</li>\r\n<li>The difference between Mepis and Ubuntu seems to be that Mepis can handle external devices much better than Ubuntu - I doubt it. There are hardly any differences in the number of kernel drivers and other additional drivers. This looks more like a reason to have a reason.</li>\r\n<li>Which distribution to choose: You might want to include the best answer I ever heard to this question: \"Take the distribution which these people use whom you would ask for help\". This means: Take the one your friends use. Because they will ask questions, and most people are not fit enough to guide users of other distributions.</li>\r\n<li>Last but not least: I'm a Free Software Adivocat, as you call them, and I definitely don't like \"GNU/Linux\". I outlined several arguments above, and there are much more against. Btw., most of the distributions out there call themselves a Linux distribution - so there are *many* FLOSS people out there who do not like the \"GNU/Linux\" term. Please don't construct an untrue picture by saying things like \"free software advocates don’t like it\". Speak for yourself, but not for others who see things different.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nSo far...."

It is debatable, however that much can be said:\r\nLinux + GNU make a complete OS; you don't need a GUI to run a server, yet a server still requires an OS (a LAMP server for example, can very easily be administered through a command line, but it's more difficult through GUIs - Apache at least has next to nothing in terms of administration GUI, MySQL is barely getting there and PHP... text only).\r\nNotice that LAMP means Linux, Apache, MySQL and Perl/PHP/Python. It should actually be GLAMP (GNU Linux Apache MySQL P...).\r\nThus, X can't really be taken into consideration. Add to that the fact that one can use Xorg, or Xfree - heh. No, X doesn't stand. Same for desktop environments.\r\nDistros usually come with a preferred DE, however, you usually can swap one for the other easily (Ubuntu to Kubuntu is a Qt download away, Mandriva is pro-KDE but provides tools using gtk+, SuSE is pro-GNOME but Qt is a click away...)\r\nGNU/Linux is a text-only yet powerful and versatile OS; Linux-based distributions are just that: GNU with X - among other softwares such as X, Gnome, Xfce, Apache...\r\n\r\nHowever, nowadays, the layman considers that an OS needs a GUI - which it doesn't, actually. Thing is, Microsoft has put into everybody's mind that a OS is monolithic; xBSD are almost there, Windows certainly is, Solaris was there... But GNU/Linux aren't.\r\n\r\nAs such, normal naming conventions don't fit. GNU/Linux is not very appropriate, but what to use? Linux alone isn't good either.\r\n\r\nWhat stands best is '<name> Free/Open distribution', actually (OpenSuse, Mandriva Free, Linspire Free, Ubuntu...).\r\n...\r\nUnending discussion.\r\n\r\nBut don't start sending 'trolls' comments everywhere!

    body: "I agree with the people who say that the name of the system isn't hugely important, and it isn't worth having a big argument about. But in case you're interested, here's what the GNU project have to say about using names longer than \"GNU/Linux\", from http://www.gnu.org/gnu/gnu-linux-faq.html:\r\n\r\n\"Many other projects contributed to the system as it is today; it includes TeX, X11, Apache, Perl, and many more programs. Don't your arguments imply we have to give them credit too? (But that would lead to a name so long it is absurd.)\r\n\r\nWhat we say is that you ought to give the system's principal developer a share of the credit. The principal developer is the GNU Project, and the system is basically GNU.\r\n\r\nIf you feel even more strongly about giving credit where it is due, you might feel that some secondary contributors also deserve credit in the system's name. If so, far be it from us to argue against it. If you feel that X11 deserves credit in the system's name, and you want to call the system GNU/X11/Linux, please do. If you feel that Perl simply cries out for mention, and you want to write GNU/Linux/Perl, go ahead.\r\n\r\nSince a long name such as GNU/X11/Apache/Linux/TeX/Perl/Python/FreeCiv becomes absurd, at some point you will have to set a threshold and omit the names of the many other secondary contributions. There is no one obvious right place to set the threshold, so wherever you set it, we won't argue against it.\r\n\r\nDifferent threshold levels would lead to different choices of name for the system. But one name that cannot result from concerns of fairness and giving credit, not for any possible threshold level, is “Linux”. It can't be fair to give all the credit to one secondary contribution (Linux) while omitting the principal contribution (GNU).\"\r\n\r\n--\r\nGNU - free as in freedom"

Access to the source code is a precondition for this.</li><li>The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor (freedom 2).</li><li>The freedom to improve the program, and release your improvements to the public, so that the whole community benefits (freedom 3). Access to the source code is a precondition for this.</li> </ul> \r\n\r\nAnd the second reason is and I will quote richard stallman \"But we don't think that is the right way to consider the question. The GNU Project was not, is not, a project to develop specific software packages. It was not a project  to develop a C compiler, although we did that. It was not a project to develop a text editor, although we developed one. The GNU Project's aim was to develop a complete free Unix-like system: GNU.\r\n\r\nMany people have made major contributions to the free software in the system, and they all deserve credit. But the reason it is an integrated system—and not just a collection of useful programs—is because the GNU Project set out to make it one. We made a list of the programs needed to make a complete free system, and we systematically found, wrote, or found people to write everything on the list. We wrote essential but unexciting components because you can't have a system without them. Some of our system components, the programming tools, became popular on their own among programmers, but we wrote many components that are not tools. We even developed a chess game, GNU Chess, because a complete system needs good games too.\"end quote.\r\n\r\nTo more explane read the articles in these sites:\r\n<ul> <li>http://www.fsf.org/licensing/essays/free-sw.html</li> <li>http://www.gnu.org/gnu/linux-and-gnu.html</li> </ul>\r\nAnd to end it free as in freedom . \r\n"

    body: "<cite>And: who … can say it is ok to stop at the GNU and to not include X?</cite>\r\nThere are no hard lines defined even by the FSF people [1] on what constitutes the Operating System proper, and what constitutes things on top of it. IMHO, a good reference point might be the POSIX standard [2]. This describes the base definitions, system interfaces, and shell and utilities required for a conforming POSIX and/or XSI system. For example, the kernel and C library would satisfy the system interfaces and many GNU packages such as coreutils and bash and others might satisfy the shell and utilities. Since the overall goal of “GNU/Linux” is to establish a unix-like system, and the best current measure of a unix-like system is the POSIX standard, this seems like a good hard boundary between the OS-proper and stuff that runs on the OS-proper.\r\n\r\n<cite>Yes, GNU is nice, but almost no one besides a lost group of geeks would use the entire OS without X</cite>\r\nPerhaps you meant “use the entire OS <em>as a desktop</em> without X”. \r\n\r\n<cite>while there are distributions out there compiled with other compilers than GCC.</cite>\r\nCompiling a distribution with a non-GCC compiler does not make it a “GNU/Linux” distro. In fact, many BSD variants are compiled with gcc. The method of translating source into machine code should be irrelevant to the crediting of a project in an operating system’s name (especially when said project is open source). Having written that, I can give you a way to make a fully-functional non-GNU-based linux system: use the linux for the kernel, use uClibc for your C library, and use busybox for your utilities. You will conform to a large extent to the POSIX standard.\r\n\r\n\r\nP.S., Personally, I too am a Free Software Advocate, and I don’t like “GNU/Linux” either.
