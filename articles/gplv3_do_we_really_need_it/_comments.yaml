    body: "Whether or not you think that copying information without the copyright owner's permission is immoral, please don't use words such as \"theft\" to refer to it. The two are fundamentally different. When you take something away from someone, such as a physical object, that's theft, because you've deprived them of it. When you make a copy of some information, such as software or music, that isn't theft, because all the other copies still exist, so you haven't deprived anyone of anything. There's some good information on this at http://www.questioncopyright.org/faq.\r\n\r\nI also disagree with your view that somehow everyone in the free software and open source movements are criminals. Richard Stallman started the free software movement because he thought everyone should be allowed to copy and modify their software. He decided that it wasn't a good idea to just do that with existing proprietary software as it was illegal, so he decided to write a new operating system from scratch, GNU, which people could have those freedoms with legally. Just because people in our movement use some software because it allows us to copy and modify it, that doesn't mean that we do that illegally with other software.\r\n\r\nAlso, the reason we're against Digital Restrictions Management (DRM) is to stop people who distribute copies of free (as in freedom) software from using DRM to deny other people the same freedoms they have with it. It's not about making it easier to break the DRM on other information to infringe copyright.\r\n\r\n--\r\nGNU - free as in freedom"

However the fact that there is currently DRM applied makes it currently more difficult to follow the law than to \"steal\". I'm using Linux, so no iTunes or other DRM protected shops that I can use. On the other hand there is a lot of illegal MP3's easy to get. Even if I could use a DRM music shop on Linux, I would not be able to play the music I paid for on my portable MP3 player (I already had one before DRM enabled devices existed and don't see why I should invest in a new device, I have the right to use my existing investment). Nor would I be able to convert the music I bought to another format in case that would make sense someday. The result is that today (not wanting to \"steal\"), my digital music collection exists from songs I ripped myself from my own audio CD's + some I bought or acquired legally for free from DRM-free online shops. However the music industry does make sure not much the DRM-free shops don't offer much interesting music. As a result I can't find much interesting legal DRM-free music online, and I buy much less music then I would want to. The real criminals that want to make money out illegal content distribution can get by DRM easy enough. So today DRM reduces the functionality for the goodwilling law abiding user, while the criminals with wrong intentions are simply not bothered by it. That is why I am against DRM. NOT because I want to derive the author from what is rightfully his. But because I only want to pay for something that meets my needs. DRM does not do any good to the end users, nor the music industry (making it too difficult on users just drives them to other solutions that might be illegal).\r\n\r\n2. On Patents:\r\nWhile I do agree with the value of patents in certain sectors (e.g. pharmaceuticals), I do not in the ICT sector. A patent is intended to make it worthwhile to invest in research and development. In the physical world this is expensive, and so to make sure that people do invest in innovation, a patent gives them the opportunity to have a monopoly from the innovation to cover for the investment. However in software development, the cost in research and development is very low, often even not existing (only a cost for production, i.e. the software development process itself). There it makes no sense at all to give a monopoly, as there is no incentive needed to drive innovation (the FOSS community is living proof of this point of view). Moreover even if there would be, compared to the physical world, the evolution is so much more rapid, that it does certainly not make sense to give the same time period for the monopoly. Even 5 years would be ridiculous in ICT. Most ICT technologies are superseeded after a couple of years (they might still be in use in legacy systems, but better technologies being deployed in the mean time, so not having any sales value anymore).\r\nThe worst is that due to the low costs in R&D for software, the cost of applying for a patent is much higher then the cost of the innovation itself. This leads to the perverse situation that only the rich companies can apply for patents, even on very simple stuff. By holding these patents and using them against the less rich (often small companies or individuals), they stiffle innovation instead of driving it. This makes software patents counter productive to the goal of patents.\r\nToday patents on software are abused by big companies. There are even companies that don't innovate at all but just buy patents to suck money out of other companies. Money that these companies need to get from their customers, and thus eventually from the consumers. So all consumers need to pay so that some players abusing the patent system just get richer for doing nothing productive. That is why I am against software patents. Not for \"stealing\" other peoples innovation, but to make sure that anyone can be innovative without fear of someone holding some obscure patent against them on something really evident and simple.\r\n\r\nBefore you start calling names (thieves) to people with another opinion then yours, please first try asking why they have that opinion.

It does not, and it will not ever, work, unless you manage to somehow change the laws of physics. What DRM tries to accomplish -- to forbid you from making a copy of a given file -- is physically impossible: the mere act of <em>playing</em> a file already <em>implies</em> making a copy. You cannot play a digital file without copying it first. Of course, DRM does make it <em>harder</em> to copy a file; but those who want to do illegal stuff hardly ever care about whether something is \"hard\" to do or not. In short, all DRM will ever accomplish is to annoy the hell out of people who are actually legitimate, paying, customers.\r\n\r\nGreat way to do business.\r\n\r\nSecond, and this is really a pet peeve of mine, <strong><em>making illegal copies of copyrighted work does not equal theft</em></strong>. Saying it's the same thing is like saying murder equals theft, because \"you took a person's life\". It's not. It's illegal, it's unethical, it's punishable by jail time in most countries, but so are many things; that does not make it theft."

    body: "I have to disagree with you there. I don't think copying information without the copyright holder's permission is \"unethical\" in any way. When you steal something, that's unethical because you've deprived them of it. When you murder someone, this is even more unethical because you've taken their life, which also harms their friends and family. However, when you copy information, such as software or music, this isn't unethical because you haven't taken anything away from them or harmed them. They still have all the copies of it they had before, and all the money they had before.\r\n\r\nIt's important to remember that copyright isn't a natural right people have. It's an artifical power (note the difference between a right and a power) given to people to benefit the public. We trade our freedom to make copies of it for the opportunity of often having more made available to us, because it's easier for publishers and authors/artists to make money from them. However, as it's very easy to copy information nowadays, the loss of the freedom to make copies has become quite a large burden on us, and I'd say it's often not worth the possibility of allowing more works to be published, as it's also relatively cheap to distribute works now.\r\n\r\nThis artificiality of copyright can be seen from the fact that it only lasts a certain amount of time (though the copyright industry keep managing to persuade governments to extend it over and over again). You say that \"I do not think it should be legal to copy copyrighted works without the permission of the author. Never. Ever.\" Does that mean you think it's wrong to copy a work when it's in copyright, but the instant it falls into the public domain, that's different and suddenly it's OK? Or do you think it's still unethical when it's in the public domain? If so, do you think I should have to ask the permission from Shakespeare's descendants to perform one of his plays?\r\n\r\nOne thing I will say is unethical is revealing private and confidential information about someone, which can harm them in other ways. This is different from copying information which is made available to the public.\r\n\r\n--\r\nGNU - free as in freedom"

The length of time copyright lasts for has also changed many times, and it varies between different countries. How can copying a particular piece of information in one country be unethical while at the same time being OK in another country? It's important to remember that the law should follow ethics as closely as possible, not the other way around.\r\n\r\nI agree that people don't have a natural right to access to a copy of every piece of information ever made, because they can't force someone else to make a copy for them if they don't want to. However, I do believe that once someone has a copy of some information, it's their natural right to make as many copies of it as they want, unless it's beneficial for the public to temporarily suspend that right (by allowing more useful information to be published). Whether or not you can copy some information affects you more directly than the person who created it (or the copyright holder, who is often someone different), because you can directly enjoy the benefit of having more copies of it, but making that copy will only affect that other person if it prevents you from buying a copy which you would have definitely bought otherwise. Often, you wouldn't have bought a copy otherwise. That's why being allowed to copy information is a freedom, but being allowed to stop other people from copying it is a power.\r\n\r\n--\r\nGNU - free as in freedom"

In my opinion, a law on copyright is ethical. Having the right to claim copyright allows one not only to make some money out of their work if they so choose (which is necessary if you want to run a business, and does not require non-free software); it also allows you to clearly associate yourself with your work, being able to point to something and say \"this is what I did\", since you're name's all over it.\r\n\r\nWhile I agree that not all laws are good&mdash;the DMCA and EUCD come to mind&mdash;I generally feel that breaking the law is unethical. Moreover, I do agree with you that the length of copyright and the extensions thereof are madness&mdash;but they do not apply to computer software copyright, since no computer software has been around long enough to have its copyright expire."
