On one hand it is useful (and in its context I think intended) to show the flexibility of the language and variety of ways to do things.\r\n\r\nBut I would like just one way shown for each, such as one way to iterate a range, one way to iterate each element of a container, one way to loop until a condition is met.\r\n\r\nAdditionally I want to mix onto it comparable constructs to other languages.\r\n\r\nWhat I haven't concluded is the best way to organise it to make it browsable as I think a layered browsing approach is more important to beginners or people wanting to glance through a new language than search ability."

I have never found anything like it for any other language. \r\n\r\nMy point in bringing this up is that such a site for ALL languages would be awesome for both the collection reusable code as well as an educational tool if it had the appropriate search tools.\r\n\r\nI have a server, time and some interest in seeing something like this develop.

    body: "On the link you give. The fairly linear structure of a wiki is not really good to organize bookmarks. All bookmarks will be reorganized with foksonomy tagging and presented within a web 2.0 interface. But I this will take me a few weeks to finish (more exactly, this will take me a few weeks to finish other projects before I can work on that one). You can see an early draft at <a href=\"http://projects.widged.com/exercist/assets/bookmarks/\">education bookmarks</a>, which gives you access to my personal collection of bookmarks.\r\n\r\nIf you type in etivities in the first box... then you will get a huge list of websites which contain examples of codes for learning activities.

I am too busy for now with other projects like writing educational software and working on some ideas for a viral education game. \r\n\r\nWell, I have been an academic for 10 years. I taught in the best universities. I became a drop out because I got fed up of the right tools and infrastructures not existing. The problem within education is not about making codes and snippets available to teachers. The problem within education is that many teachers have great things to contribute but most cannot because of technical obstacles. You also have to take into account that most resources like koders or snipplr are not adequate for a teacher community. They simply don't have the time (or even not the interest) to browse through these large collections. You can estimate that a teacher has an hour or perhaps two to waste in a week. Not much more.\r\n\r\nI am trying to design tools that let teachers do what they do best, create great content without having to become technical expert or design experts or being expected to spend long hours commenting, rating, or contributing resources to the community (like asking them to provide learning object metadata or uploading their courseware onto a directory, which most do not, however keen they are on the idea of free and open software -- I know, I didn't do it myself, I was simply too busy when working as an academic). \r\n\r\nHowever, this takes time set them up, one by one,and I started only a year ago and this takes time. And I need to intermix these activities that bring no money with others that help me earn a living, somehow.\r\n\r\nAnybody interested in doing something similar is welcome to contact me to try to synchronize our efforts ;-).
