    body: "Hi,\r\n\r\njust a quick comment:\r\nIf you're on a virtual server with no control over the fysical filesystems, but with the ability to mount filesystems, you can use a piece of system ram to create a ramdisk and use that as a place to put the session stuff from either apache, java or php:\r\n\r\n/bin/mount -t tmpfs tmpfs -o size=16M,nodev,nosuid,noexec /mnt/ramdisk/\r\nmount --bind /mnt/ramdisk /chroot/apache2/tmp\r\n\r\nThe above will give you a 16Mb ramdisk, which is mounted nodev,nosuid,noexec\r\nThe second mount command will add this as \"tmp\" to the chroot'ed apache jail created with mod_security.\r\n\r\nKeep in mind to clear out sessions periodically!\r\n\r\nregards,\r\nNiels"

The Linux operating system platform is one of the fruits of the exchange of such ideas, their implementation and ultimately their use the world over.This book can not cover everything that is to be known about securing Linux, but without input from many generous folks who gave their time and who continue to take great care and have pride in their efforts this book could not be a powerful tool in helping you to secure your Linux servers.\r\nJohn Terpstra\r\n\r\nhttp://www.soyo123.com/HardeningLinux/"
