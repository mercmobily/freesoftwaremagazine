    body: "I keep wondering why, after all the pre election warnings of how the 2006 election results were going to prove the election had been stolen. Jessie Jackson, Nancy Polosi, Howard Dean, Hugo Ch√°vez, Castro, Kennedy, ABC, CBS, NBC, PBS, (just to name a few) ALL warned us the results of the 2006 elections could not be trusted!\r\n\r\nNow after the democrats won, we heard nothing more on the subject? Does this mean the trustworthyness of election results hinge on which party wins?\r\n\r\nAnd they wonder why we don't trust any of them to do anything other than lie, cheat, and steal..... All for the higher good of keeping their power and continue to do nothing to help the common folk. Pontification and BS empty promises don't count! Never did, never will! No matter who is doing the snow job!!\r\n\r\nindependant linuxusr "

I attribute the lack of more outrage to the facts:\r\n\r\n1) The weirdness and fraud that we do know about isn't enough to sway the outcomes.  (Not true of previous outrages.)\r\n\r\n2) The public has a short attention span.  We heard a /lot/ about it before, and that burnt out any chance for the \"story to have legs.\"\r\n\r\nI think it's premature to suggest anyone is disingenuous."

    body: 'The fact is that when paper ballots were used fraud was a common problem. People unlike machines are easily swayed and prone to cheat.  The other fact is is that most states require voting machine companies to release there code to them.  It''s not in the general public eye and open to hackers, but specialists in parties are able to see the code and ensure fairness.  One mistake that many states made is they did not require a paper backup.  In Utah the voting machines had a paper cashier roll that printed your vote and scrolled through so you could confirm that the vote is correct.  No lost votes.  I think that should have been a National Standard.  As far as opening the code for all the world to see, well that just gives hackers more time to figure out how to manipulate the system.  Frankly I think it''s a stupid idea, and going back to paper only ballots, will only open up the opportunity for vote counters to make "errors" in favor of their candidate.'

Then they can finish enslaving the human race in the name of security by 2012. \r\n\r\nOpen source, and two receipt paper trail is the way to go. The whole voter privacy thing can be exploited as well. It's no longer the 1800's where people were intimidated into voting like the mob would target a juror.\r\n\r\nWhile I'm on the subject, the final canidates can be exploited as well! WHY ONLY TWO?! What if one is no better than the other like BUSH/KERRY? Wow! What a choice!\r\n\r\nFOIA that software."

    body: "You must not read the news much. At least two of the races in the 2006 election are being questioned because the voting totals make no sense: In one case thousands of voters apparently entered the booth and chose not to vote, and in the other there were thousands more votes than there were voters in that county (which also happened in the last presidential race in Ohio).\r\n\r\nAlso Re the Chavez election. It was observed by international voting inspectors and was declared an example of good election procedure. Also the Venezuelan exit polls matched the election results, which is more than you can say for our last 2 Presidential races."
