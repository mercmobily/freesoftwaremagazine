    body: "In my experience \"Business\" organisations in the uk, particularly the CBI, emphasize that children in our schools should be taught MS Office.  Aside from the politics of this being both anti-competition and potential illegal support of a monopoly, is it not the case that we also have to persuade the executive layer of business of the great value of teaching computing rather than teaching Microsoft?\r\n\r\nC de Salis"

    body: "You may be thinking that education is about teaching children, helping them to grow.\r\n\r\nWhat if the underlying premise was something completely different? Suppose somehow the idea was simply to train them, like animals are trained? \r\n\r\nThen, the current system works very well. It produces people who equates computers with Microsoft Office. It discourages them from even thinking about anything else.\r\n\r\nSo, the problem from a Free Software standpoint, becomes how do we change the entire system of education, not simply change out closed software for Free Software. Because simply using Free Software instead, produces the same trained animals. Just trained in Free Software instead.\r\n\r\nFree Software exists to enable people to become and remain free. If the current system of education overall is designed to remove and discourage freedom, then the whole thing has to go, not just the ICT curriculum.\r\n\r\nRead the book. http://www.johntaylorgatto.com/chapters/index.htm\r\n"

    body: "In the US there are several problems, the first being that using computers in education at all has only relatively recently become a part of the curriculum for training K-12 teachers, much less how to teach computer use to students.  Teachers who graduated more than 10 years ago (probably > 60% of all teachers) have mostly had to educate themselves about using computers in education.  And understandably, those who have taken the initiative to do so have taken the path of least resistance.  For older teachers, this meant Apple, and there are still some Apple IIs around.\r\n\r\nAnother problem is that purchasing decisions are made by each school system.  Because of the hallowed mythology of independence here in the US, every community (city, county, parish, etc.) has its own school system, with an elected or appointed school board that changes somewhat with each election cycle.  Between the low levels of technological understanding in school systems (largely due to tightly stretched budgets) and the school boards' desire to prove their worth through 'shaking up the system', the wheel gets reinvented (by trial and error with lots of errors) again and again and again ...  The desire for quick results (another quaint trait of ours), usually leads to the purchase of equipment and software with the flashiest sales brochures.\r\n\r\nOne bit of good news is that many of the kids who are going into IT tend to discover FOSS for themselves, thanks to the internet and community mentors.  Our local LUG has begun talking about how we might be able to promote FOSS to students and the general consensus is to ignore the school system and look for extra-curricular activities we can sponsor.  Also, at the college level, FOSS is much more recognized, although proprietary systems are prevalent.  Most of the larger colleges have fairly active LUGs, and we are hoping to find ways to work with those in our area.\r\n"

    body: "One of the main problems with computing full stop is not wether its FLOSS or not - the whole Office concept is completely misguided.\r\nIn an internet age why make things paper shaped?\r\nAnother problem is data management. \r\nI can get the Linux kernel and compile it and debug it and have complete knowledge of the status of several hundred thousand variables.\r\nThe average user, let alone company does not know the contents of most of their documents and have to do repeated searches to find even the most simple things.\r\nI am a great believer in FLOSS but just because 10 million flies eat the ordure of office doesnt mean we should try and replace it with free version. We should replace it with a version that serves the user or company without blindly going down the office route."

    body: "How about the idea that children should be kept away from computers, as they are already kept away from dangerous tools, and asked to learn how to think.\r\n\r\nMSWord is little more than a glorified editor that most people master after 15 minutes of playing around. Sure it can do wonderous things but are you ever likely to make use of them?\r\n\r\nNo?\r\n\r\nThe same goes for most kids.\r\n\r\nWe should be teaching children how to think and reason.\r\n\r\nTeaching the how to use Open Source is almost as bad as teaching them how to use MS products. All they learn is how to use the hammer to knock a nail in. They don't learn the difference between the hammer and the nail.\r\n\r\nMost people don't want to learn anything about computers other than how to use them.\r\n\r\nMost people think single button mice are brain dead.\r\n\r\nMost people don't really think!\r\n\r\nAs long as computers are used as dumb tools we have some hope for the adults of tomorrow. If, however, we mislead them into thinking that knowing how to use MSWord or AbiWord or SWriter is the same thing as knowing something about computers we are doing them a major disservice.\r\n\r\nI work with soemone who hardly touched a computer in secondary school. The first time she used a computer was at university. She is a great developer.\r\n\r\nKids don't need to learn about computers in school. That can wait until much later.\r\n\r\nPerhaps they need to learn how to type things into MSWord.\r\n\r\nBut lets not call that \"learning\". It is training, pure and simple. So it fits into the same category as PE.\r\n\r\nAnd is just about as exciting."

Who wants to do word processing, spreadsheets, and death by powerpoint all day long. Todays pupils are creating their own blogs, with video footage, edited using a computer, music created by them with a computer, Animation, you name it, they are producing it. \r\nSo why are they not having an exciting curriculum with this type of content? \r\nThe reason, exams. Most of the exams are tested in  WP, SP, PP,DB,  and for them, the wording of these exams are in the office suite. We use a different Database program, and every time there is an exam, we have to make sure the pupils understand the access lingo before their exam. - Isn't that an unfair system?\r\nNot also forgetting that some of the more exciting subeject matters in ICT do not count the same when talking about the league tables, on how all schools perform. Lets face it, that is what the school's are judged on, is it? Don't you think that these are the issues that need changing, and then students in the UK may actually receive a changed ICT curriculum."
