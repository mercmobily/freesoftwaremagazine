  The [GPLv3](http://fsfeurope.org/projects/gplv3/) process  has entered it's final stage with FSF  releasing [GPLv3  discussion draft 4](http://gplv3.fsf.org/comments/gplv3-draft-4.html).  Some particularly good news is that this draft  is finally compatible with the Apache licence.

  Accompanying this "last call draft" is:


* [An essay by RMS: Why    Upgrade to GPL Version 3](http://gplv3.fsf.org/rms-why.html)
* [The    rationale document of the changes](http://gplv3.fsf.org/gpl3-dd4-rationale.pdf)
* [The press    release](http://www.fsf.org/news/gpl3dd4-released)
* And other documents on  FSF's [Guide to  dd4 page](http://gplv3.fsf.org/gpl3-dd4-guide.html)
