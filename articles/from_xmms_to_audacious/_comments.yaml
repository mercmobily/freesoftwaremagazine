Its animation was flawless, the action contained one of the most violent fights seen to date in Anime, and it closed most of the plot holes in the series - it was thus technically perfect.

    body: "The XMMS bug count fell to almost none to zero, but the code is so unmaintainable that we eventually decided stop working on it. You guys don't really get what software development (not \"churning out code for the money\", but i really mean software development) is about, and what decisions have to be done if you're a project manager, and are trying to think long term.\r\n\r\nXMMS has zero bug count but the codebase is so flawed that no one who codes would want to put his fingers into it. I very much doubt the Audacious developers would have had any fun with it before we actually rewrote approx. 60-70% of the XMMS code; all they did was cherrypicking, taking the codebase after we had brought it to a minimal level of real maintainability (far from what i'd call maintainable but at least something that can be worked on), and the countless bugs we've introduced were just the result of taking apart a big block of spaghettized monlithic code which you really can not take apart without breaking everything of it at once in various spots.)\r\n\r\nA business that has limited funds (as almost every business has; it's a result of their growth and a balance between funds/venture capital and the amount of products/product lines and/or their complexity/range and external investments) and has to get in some revenue constantly (same thing; or they just go, well, \"out of\" business), it has to always keep a working product line going, and can't allow for too much research on sideprojects or some \"next-gen foundation\", but development is inherently iterative due to the business constraints.\r\n\r\nOr (or!) you have so much money that you can have something out there that works in the meantime, and in your back offices develop something that is experimental. With free OSS development (volunteer work, not paid by companies; that is, free software developed by people in their free time), the strain you have is comparable to a company that has a) nothing to loose and b) has unlimited funds.  But, that isn't enough.\r\n\r\nThat's where many OSS projects fail in the way you've described, since they just slumber along (nothing to loose: nothing to do!). \r\n\r\n*We* have a _long_ term goal, but it's not laid out into infinity. We are watching timeline constraints, but we're not stupid enough to haste things nor are we under cash pressure so we can leave the 1 or 2 years it takes for BMP 2.0 to come out.\r\n\r\nYou should take a look at: <a href=\"http://bmpx.beep-media-player.org/site/FAQ#Why_is_Item_X_or_Feature_X_not_implemented.2C_even_though_it_seems_trivial.3F\">BMPx FAQ: Missing 'trivial' features</a>\r\n\r\nI'm sure some \"senior\" (whatever that means; I've met too many 60 to 70 year old junior seniors in disguise so far) \"developers\" or \"consultants\" or \"experts in the IT field\" will contradict what we're doing and call it doomed from the start (heh) but you're just ain't getting it.\r\n\r\nDip your fingers into the XMMS code and then we're talking. If all that matters to you is a zero bug count, and not maintainablity of code, then you don't know anything about economics, in the educational/scientific sense, as well as in a mere natural, instinctive sense, nor do you seem to get that the entire OSS development ecosystem is geared towards creating stable foundations rather than pushing out finished products at point releases.\r\n\r\nBefore you anchor your hook into the previous statement: That's also where a lot of projects fail; they keep creating infrastructure for so long that they seem to eventually forget they were actually planning to release a product. With BMPx and BMP2, we have something that is usable _right now_, yet it's still only the draft of BMP2. It's both at the same time: A clean codebase with very good maintainability, and at the same time already a usable media player. We put the 2 things of this hypothetical company that has unlimited funds into *one* box: the product that is out there and works, and the development project; and guess what, it works for us. Maybe some others have failed, but that was then their misguided management or no-grasp what management of software development (to extend on the previous term) is about.\r\n\r\nIt might take another year or one and a half until we have BMP 2.0 out but after then the amount of maintenance will be minimal, the codebase will be extensible, and the right foundation for BMP 3.0.\r\n\r\nMilosz"

(EDIT: In hindsight or as i remember now it was actually so that i was mailed by the XMMS guys when i first forked it and they asked me whether i wouldn't rather want to work with then on \"XMMS2\", but i have no idea how far the project had proceeded at that time, so it's probably valid to say \"around the same time\".)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n> BMP development continued on until Milosz decided that XMMS/BMP really did need a \r\n> major rewrite; although, from what I’ve seen, he hasn’t agreed with Peter on what \r\n> XMMS’s replacement needed.\r\n\r\nFirst of all this was not my, but a team decision. We didn't \"ask Peter\" since we don't have any obligations towards the XMMS/XMMS2 developers; there was nothing to agree _upon_, and especially with BMPx, since it was written from zero with only a minimal amount of original BMP code (not even really XMMS code anymore since it as refactored already for a long time).\r\n\r\nYou seem to think that just because (the first, initial, XMMS forked BMP) was a fork, we had some kind of obligation towards the XMMS developers or what is the point you're trying to make here?\r\n\r\n>In October of 2005, Milosz forked BMP (which was essentially XMMS with GTK2 and a\r\n>ton of code refactoring, but not much in the way of new features) and called it\r\n>BMPx; although I use the term 'fork' loosely, as he decided to start the rewrite\r\n>from scratch. In addition, BMPx is designed around using Xine (and later \r\n>GStreamer) as the plugin system.\r\n\r\nYou're not using the term \"loosely\", you're entirely misusing it. I didn't fork it off, I've laid the foundation in a separate codebase and as soon as there was something the rest could work on with me, we started to work on it together. The \"code refactoring\" phase was much earlier, at times of the XMMS-forked (now in the right sense of \"forked\") BMP.\r\n\r\nGStreamer is not exactly a plugin system either. I encourage you to tell the GST developers that it is one, but beware of being flamed and chased into the bowels of hell.\r\n\r\n(\"[...] although I use the term 'fork' loosely, as he decided to start the rewrite from scratch\" How about \"I totally abuse the term and in fact he just wrote it from scratch but since i love using all those leet F/OSS words I'll just call it a spoon. Fork. Whatever.\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n> Milosz did alienate several developers during BMPx development when he decided to\r\n> scrap BMP's original code. Some left in anger, others left because they were\r\n> board with the project, and some decided to work on some of the other media\r\n> players.\r\n\r\nBoard. \"Bored\" perhaps?. Well AAMOF no developers left because of the rewrite which again was not the initial fork of XMMS (your text is really way jumbled up basically beyond correctability; maybe I should \"fork\" it and \"rewrite it from scratch\" instead...). There were no developers alienated because of our change. Some left later on but for other reasons than the code rewrite (like, becoming more active in infrastructure development e.g. GStreamer or Gtk+.)\r\n\r\nNo one from the original BMP team as far as I know works on other media players. (Sounds like you're trying to tell a goodnight story for children to sleep: \"And if they didn't die, they still live somewhere out there, working on other media players!\")\r\n\r\nIt looks to me like you've read our About page, did some kind of minimal research or something, and then intentionally jumbled this up. I'm not necessarily saying you did, but being a person who actually *lived* through all those times from X11amp to Audacious, and being the initiator of the BMP _project_ which currently develops BMP 2, I know the actual facts, and you've just got them so plain wrong that you either made it all up or deliberately forged them so your article can make a point on Audacious. You've simply got all facts surrounding BMP development wrong; all of it.\r\n\r\nAlso, you just fail to realize that BMPx is, while it's not a Winamp2-alike media player anymore, very well made in it's own right and on a really good way to become BMP 2.\r\n\r\nIf emo overwhelms you and the winamp2 GUI gives you a warm buzz then that's long time no reason to say that players with entirely different concepts are a dead end.\r\n\r\nMilosz\r\n\r\nPS: I've been writing for magazines too and I can only give you the hint that you really should stop doing that unless you are willing to do the basic fundamental stuff that needs to be done before writing an article, starting with proper  background research."

I would indeed agree that countless bugs have been introduced at this point, which are now resolved. Now that the foundation is solid, individual areas of the code are selected for a performance-enhancing rewrite, which at times adds more features as well.\r\nIn other words, Audacious does partial rewrites in-between releases, with the codebase never unusable for over 48 hours. Having absorbed most of the plugins allows us to keep even SVN in a workable state. I'm not sure that \"that was wrong, I'll smash it all down and rewrite from scratch\" is a good approach, especially if it happens more then once.\r\nGenerally, a good way to see which open source software is succeeding is how much developers it attracts and can keep interested. In your company analogy, how many employees one can retain. It would suffice to say that Audacious is a much larger company."
