    body: "At the time of writing scant concrete information is available from Google about Chrome OS, and the above response makes certain assumptions about community expectations, technical details of the software, and Google's likely product strategy.\r\n\r\nI think that these assumptions are reasonable given the level of public details at this time, and I hope that where I make assumptions, they will be useful for sparking interest and debate, and not be proven to be unreasonable or unduly cynical.\r\n\r\nSam."

They are machines, and in an environment with insufficient regulation, they can go horribly wrong.\r\n\r\nStrapping myself onto such a machine with no provision for escape is a risk I'm personally not willing to take!\r\n\r\nCentralization trends make me very nervous. So, yes, I will still be using KDE for a long time, I think.\r\n"
