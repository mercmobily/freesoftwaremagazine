    body: "If you're writing something big, or something complex, you more than likely want to use pre-written, pre-tested code.  But, there is the occasional task where everything you might use is just too big, hairy and complex, and you just need a simple solution.\r\n\r\nFor example, our company needed a very simple task recording and issue tracking web application, and we needed the results to be kept in a (hiss) SQL Server database.  Now, there definitely are applications out there which could do this, but what we wanted was so basic in comparison to the applications we found that it was worth our time to create the application ourselves.  And we did.  And it works like a champ.\r\n\r\nIf what you want is a very simple wheel, and all you can find are complex ones, I suggest you consider reinventing it."

I'm sure lots of people would be interested in your system for peer review with good support for revisions, and also just a guide for those who are relatively new to Drupal.\r\n\r\nDisclaimer: I'm setting up a journal for the student grassroots network <a href=\"http://www.peopleandplanet.org\">People & Planet</a> at the moment with Drupal, so I have a special interest in what you've done ;)"

    body: "Another CMS written specifically for magazines and newspapers is Campsite (http://www.campware.org).  It understands what \"issues\" are, workflow, fine-grained access control for the backend, subscription management, RSS, and multi-lingual content.  It's also released under the GPL and has a team of full-time developers working on it.  (Disclaimer: I'm one of those developers :) )  It's in use by many real-world publishers around the world and a lot of work has gone into making it easy to use (e.g. for the journalist who just got his first computer yesterday). \r\n\r\nIf you want to give it look (the backend admin interface), check it out here:\r\nhttp://campsite-demo.campware.org/admin/\r\n \r\nDifferent CMS's have different strengths: some are for community portals, some are for blogs, some are for posting photos.  Campsite is for publishing magazines and newspapers.  Give it a look and let us know what you think!  "
