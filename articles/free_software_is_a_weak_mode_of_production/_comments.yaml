I think a lot of people fall into the trap of thinking that if you can't justify something from a neo-liberal, money spinning perspective, there is something wrong with it. And, while that's a seductive trap to fall into, it's so much nicer if you realise that other approaches can work as well? It's called progress. I mean, while people who classify as hippies or activists are often annoying and patchouli-scented, and derrided as lazy layabout stoners, they often manage to achieve real results - but then, once they do, the results are snatched away by the mainstream and turned into responsible and grownup things. Sometimes it's nice for things to remain in the realm of 'ethical' versus 'economical'. Anyway... thanks for putting it all so succinctly. \r\n\r\nCheers :-)"

I think many creative people who manage to make a living today from their work are afraid of what all of this freedom will mean to their livelihood, whether in software, music, movies, and etc., and I understand it.

But it just seems like something amazing is happening and I don't want to see it stamped out because of fear, uncertainty, and doubt.\r\n\r\nI read something today (but unfortunately can't remember where or what it was exactly) comparing the development of the scientific method with free software development methods.  Imagine how resistant people must have been to this crazy newfangled scientific method, and how threatening it was.  I hope in a few hundred years, people will just accept that *obviously* information has to be free.  (Or maybe it will be like America today, where we have to have this debate about whether evolution could possibly have happened or if it's really the Flying Spaghetti Monster we should be looking to for answers.

    body: "\"Sometimes it's nice for things to remain in the realm of 'ethical' versus 'economical'.\"\r\n\r\nIt seems to me you've missed the point entirely.  These guys want you to believe that free software is the 'moral and uneconomic' route, and thus anti-money, which by definition requires both greed and the desire for the most economical decisions (like replacing all your employees with chinese slave-labour).  The truth that they so desperately don't want you to realize is that free-software done right* (important wording!) is both morally *and* economically superior to the model upon which they have built their lively-hood.  There's no reason to fear these people though.  They can throw FUD at 'free' software all they like, and they may slow the project to some degree, but in the end the economics of 'free' (in all it's meanings) will win.  The key difference between their ideal and the 'free' ideal is that you can kill a project whose only reason for being is money, but you cannot kill a project whose only reason for being is the knowledge of it's having been.\r\n\r\n* Free software can be done 'wrong' easily.  There are several reasons for this, but here's 3 off the top of my head:\r\n\r\n(1) Many 'free' projects are started as a hobby by someone who thinks it's a good way to get a head-start, but really doesn't understand the long-term obligations.  Eventually this person will inadvertently kill their own project by alieniating their own supporters.\r\n\r\n(2) People that think much like those at IPCentral will actively try to sabotage the project in the hopes of picking up the pieces when it falls apart.\r\n\r\n(3) Many projects are started in a company where a small group of individuals 'get it', but their boss doesn't.  The project will develop just long enough to become viable, at which point the boss, seeing potential, will step in and claim the project for 'the company' (i.e. himself).  It's all downhill from there."

To say that it is unimportant, or should just go away is ignorant and wreckless.

Even your everyday application like K3b beats any proprietary software for burning CD/DVD media that I've ever found.  I didn't have to pay anything for it, but if I needed support I not only have a community, but a company that I can pay to help me.  I also choose Novell's SuSE Linux to run several other servers that do anything from acting as domain controllers, and print/file servers.  Having a mixed heterogenous environment also adds to our overall security, as one 0 day exploit cannot take down all of our services.\r\n\r\nI think before you write a article that so illegitimately dismisses Open Source software as all being \"hobby-ware\", you should ask those in the industry that actually use it.

We were taught that a company makes a product, owns/licenses the product, and gets the profits from sales/licenses of the product.  The company invests R&D in the product, creates IP in the product, which they own, and they make revenue on sales or licenses of the product.  This is the \"traditional\" software market and was reflected in most software companies until the Internet boom of the late 90's.  \r\n\r\nGiving a product away, often to your competition, is very hard to understand for those that subscribe to this mindset.  Open Source, to them, is basically giving your product away. It is helping your competition compete against you.  It devalues your investments in what you perceve as your product.\r\n\r\nWhat they fail to grasp is that a lot of programming is under contract with little or no IP, just repeating the same stuff over and over (infrastructure).  They fail to grasp that much of the software stack is now a commodity which can be replaced by other components for little cost hence there is little reason to \"own\" a browser, a word processor, etc.  They fail to grasp that their widget is just built on the shoulders of other widgets just as science is built on the work of those that went before.  \r\n\r\nOpen source is a major shift.  They can't easily see how to make money, so it is a big threat.  They see a loss of value of their existing products following their existing, antiquated model.  What they fail to realize is that there still is a valid arena for commercial products and there is a large arena for services and support.  However, why would you buy a spreadsheet, operating system, word processor, database, web server, etc. when you can get very good ones for free?    Only purchase those if you need specific capabilities such as really big databases with millions of rows, replication, redundant servers, etc.\r\n\r\nToday, a software company should focus on new, innovative, creative products and use open source as a component in their toolbox.  They should encourage and support open source, much like IBM (they get it), and only create proprietary software for specialized markets or for business integration.  "

Literally every single popular song has the same basic chord and rhythm structure as previous songs written by other artists. Artists refer to it as being \"influenced\" by another artist. In the past, ideas were shared and put into print. Thus, we have great works of art, literature sciences and medicine. Today we hoard these things, lock them up so that only a select few really benefit. Our culture values wealth, but cares very little how it is attained. Today, companies are patenting the very genes that make us human. Disney made a fortune off of stories that were in the public domain and laid claim to things that never belonged to them in the first place. Cisco systems just applied for a patent on voice, data, video transmission on the same network. Yes, the patent is so broad you could run a truck through it, it basically covers all cable, telephone and microwave networks. But they have the money, so laying claim to anything is a matter of dollars & lawyers. I don't think Newton much cared if you used his calculus to solve a problem. But today you have companies patenting the obvious and abusing the justice system for profit. Penicilin wasn't patented and it certainly was not a hippie who discovered it. But drug companies lock up the rights to drugs so that most people who need the drug could never afford it. Greed can destroy a market, that's why we have the SEC here in the US.

In both cases, the software was done in a \"free\" environment.\r\n\r\nThe university software was developed in 1985 or so, so I had never heard of the GPL or Richard Stallman, but we weren't considering the software as a saleable product, but merely part of our research program.\r\n\r\nThe later work I explicitly arranged to be on a non-copyleft free license, which allowed Caltech and I to have equal footing in exploiting it, either for free or non-free purposes (as a minor ethical point I view copyleft as a type of payment arrangement, so if work is already paid for by a government or corporate grant, then I feel a non-copyleft license is more appropriate -- if the taxpayers pay for it directly or indirectly, it should be effectively in the public domain).\r\n\r\nOTOH, I've never written software as part of something to be sold, and I know maybe one person who has out of all the people I worked with (he was writing stuff for the Xbox 360, last I heard).\r\n\r\nSo, really, I just don't buy the argument that proprietary software is necessary to make programming a paying job. Other people have collected actual statistics on this (e.g. Eric Raymond), I just have my own experience, but the conclusion is the same: most software is written as a contracted service anyway.\r\n\r\nThat said, I do believe there are certain categories of software, such as games or tax-software, which have a limited duration of utility, which are completely reasonable to sell on a proprietary basis. These are products which require a rapid, schedule-driven development cycle, followed by a well-defined (and short) product lifespan.  Since they require extraordinary effort, and have only a limited time to offset the cost of development, sales of copies is a reasonable funding solution.\r\n\r\nThe alternative in such cases is something like RSPP, in which the funds are collected in advance, but that's always a bit of a risky approach (what if the funds are collected, but no product is delivered? what if the product is delivered, but it's inferior? what if you can't raise enough money in advance? etc).  The proprietary approach actually can be looked at as an after-the-fact collective patronage arrangement.\r\n\r\nOf course, by the same token, you could develop such products (and I think this would be especially cool for games) on a \"time delay\" license. Free Software Magazine itself had planned (and I think still hopes to in the future) license articles on this kind of basis: they are not available immediately under a free license, but automatically revert to one. It's kind of a re-implementation of the US constitutional idea of \"limited times\" copyrights -- but you know, for real.\r\n\r\nI tried to interest Creative Commons in promoting a license module like this as a better solution than \"non-commercial\" licenses, but there wasn't much interest. Maybe somebody will do it -- I know I haven't got the energy to become a license maintainer. ;-)\r\n\r\n"

You can't seriously think that the money won't find its way from the former to the latter in exchange for software production?\r\n\r\nThe means by which the money gets from user A to software house B might change, but its route from software house B to developer C won't really, because in both worlds only the most efficient corporate structures for software-production can survive.\r\n\r\nActually people would be prepared to spend _more_ money since they're getting software they can do _more_ with. (Greater efficiency might shrink the amount of work required, who knows, but that happens in every industry. Anyway more software will be produced, and its production will be funded.)"

For games, I like how id Software releases source code under the GPL after a period of time.\r\n\r\nOutside of software, if I were fortunate enough to sell a book to a major publisher, I'd like to think it wouldn't betray my belief in free culture to sell it under a normal copyright for a period of time (1 year?  2 years?) before releasing it under a Creative Commons Share-Alike license.  (That's in the short term.  Longer term I'd like to have a way to make money and immediately release freely.)"

    body: "Your assumptions about the economic value of software is mistaken, as is your assumption that you can only earn a living writing software if your software is closed-source.\r\n\r\nFirst, let's talk about earning money.\r\n\r\nI have earned money by being a DBA, by writing custom vertical software for niche markets, etc. I have contributed to a few free software projects, though I have never been a key player in any successful free software project. This is true for most authors of Free software-- their day-job is not writing Free software, but doing the other things geeks do, like manage your IT infrastructure.\r\n\r\nSecondly, software will get written, and people will pay others to write it. That has been proven by the success of Eclipse, Linux, Apache, Cygnus Software, Red Hat, Debian, Ubuntu, Samba, CUPS, X11, PostgreSQL, MySQL, BerkleyDB, OpenOffice, and a whole host of others, including most of the infrastructure of the Internet.\r\n\r\nNow, even if people *weren't* getting paid to directly write software, it would *still* get written. Consider the case of Enlightenment, or Nethack, or Linux, or Samba, or Debian, or many others too numerous to mention. (Yes, there's crossover. That's one of the great things about Free software-- anyone can participate, whether they are being paid to or not.)\r\n\r\nNow consider the programmers at most closed-source software vendors. Do they, the men and women who create the software, see anything but their salary? In all but the most exceptional cases, the answer is, \"No, they do not.\" They are rarely better off than the Free software programmer. Now with programming jobs being outsourced to India and China, they are in many cases worse off than Free software developers, unless they live in India or China. The holder of the \"IP\" is not the programmer, nor probably even the designer, but the corporation. It is not the programmer who wins in the closed-source world.\r\n\r\nSo the whole thought that Free software == starving programmers is false. In fact, it is an outright lie that fails in the face of all evidence. And the opposite is also not true: programmers do not see much from the fruit of their labors in the closed-source world, either.\r\n\r\nNow, let's talk about the value of software.\r\n\r\nThe value of software comes from the use of software, not the selling of software. All other things being equal (which I know they are not), GNU/Linux and MS-Windows are equally valuable to a corporation as a web server or an email server. In one case, the corporation must purchase licenses for the software (often totaling hundreds of thousands or even millions of dollars). In the other case, licenses are free.\r\n\r\nIn both cases, the corporation must pay someone to come in and install, configure, administer, and maintain the software.\r\n\r\nThe economic worth of the software is weighed against the economic cost of the software. In the end, that is the value proposition. To the corporation that is extracting value from the software, the initial and recurring costs of the software count *against* its ultimate value.\r\n\r\nThis doesn't even touch on the fact that Free software can be modified beyond its original aims, thereby giving the corporation or user even more value; nor have I mentioned the lack of support for aging closed-source software, forcing frequent, costly, and disruptive upgrades.\r\n\r\nSo, your whole point of IP being important to the value of software is not only wrong, but it is the opposite of the truth. IP impedes extraction of real economic value.\r\n"

At least, it makes more sense for the consumer.  If I'm a corporation, do I want to be dependent on Microsoft who has the incentive to keep shoving new features in to already buggy software and get it out the door and then coerce me in to upgrades when they're not needed?  Or do I want to go to Red Hat which may have more incentive to provide me with a stable environment?\r\n\r\n----\r\n<a href=\"http://www.movingtofreedom.org/\" title=\"Freedom is on the March!\">http://www.movingtofreedom.org/</a>"
