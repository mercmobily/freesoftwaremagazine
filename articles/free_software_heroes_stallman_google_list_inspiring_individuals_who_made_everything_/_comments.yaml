Also, Picassa, Google earth, and bunch of other google goodies (Google toolbar and desktop widgets <strong>JUST</strong> came to GNU/Linux, but then..)..  Google can't exactly be counted as a FLOSS hero.\r\n\r\nJWZ was also a great FLOSS contributer.. there was Netscape (I know.. not exactly free), XEmacs, and the awesome XScreeSaver!!\r\n\r\nThen there's Jon Johansen (the DeCSS guy).  If BitTorrent is there, then he too should be mentioned.. He brought in the <em>real</em> concept of Freedom to Gnu/Linux world, IMO.\r\n\r\nAnyway, great list.. keep it up!!\r\n\r\n\r\nGNU/Linux is _not_ a free operating system...\r\n...its a _priceless_ operating system!"
