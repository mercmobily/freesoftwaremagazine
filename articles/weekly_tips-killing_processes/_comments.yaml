This really shows how creativity in the free software world can thrive, because this would never be included in a commercial product.\r\n\r\nOne honorable mention: if you're in <strong>top</strong> (e.g. to look which processes use a lot of memory/cpu) you can kill an application by hitting \"k\" and typing in the PID. See  <code>man top</code>  or press \"?\" whilst in top for more info.\r\n\r\nThanks for letting me now about pdDooM (not that i'll ever use it, i kinda like the stability of my system)."

The trouble is, that person wasn't logged in.\r\nI made the decision that guarantee the spread of (relatively valuable) information, didn't sneakily change comment's contents (I hate that), and respected the poster.\r\n\r\nTo me, poor attitude is even indirectly call somebody \"stupid\" - especially if you don't even have an account.\r\n\r\nPlease note that since we receive a number of comments, we often need to decide quickly - or we would spend the best parts of our days discussing whether a word means \"A\" or \"B\" :-D\r\n\r\nWe very, very, very rarely delete comments (it only happened once, actually) and very occasionally we edit them.\r\n\r\nBye!\r\n\r\nMerc.

When a process is already dead (zombie, defunct), it can't  answer the signal."
