    body: "\"Central\" as in \"of great importance\" is a good idea. \"Central\" as in \"running on one server in one building removable by a single air strike (or more mundane disaster)\" would make me a lot less happy.\r\n\r\nI think archive.org is pretty cool, but I think we're going to want more a distributed database for \"the sum total of human knowledge\". For the long run, I think we want to store this kind of information in a more distributed way, with copies all over the world. This would also help with the mirroring, bandwidth, and even censorship problems.\r\n"

That sounds like a good thing, though I never really investigated how that works (hint hint: want to write a blog about it, Alan? ;-) ).\r\n\r\nI've already mentioned the \"single point of failure\" problem, but maybe my deeper concern is the \"single point of control\": I certainly don't want the \"sum total of human knowledge\" to be under any one person, corporation, or nation's thumb. Nor do I want them to be able to control what does and does not get listed. I'd rather deal with the inaccuracy of unreviewed material than face the long term stagnancy problems endemic to review systems, let alone intentional censorship.\r\n"

All of it sounds kind of useful right?\r\n\r\nIf we could simply set up a torrent file, on about 1000 sites and share one file, you don't even need all of it, just however much you can take. OK, maybe 100,000 seeds.\r\n\r\nWould be nice if it was one nice searchable file, that we could all share. everyone...open source yeah?\r\n\r\nMike\r\nCheers\r\n\r\n:)"
