Okay so our new forums are going well so far, but we decided we needed a forum dedicated to asking all those difficult questions. You know, the ones everyone has an opinion on. So here it is [The big free software questions](http://www.freesoftwaremagazine.com/forum/897). Here's a list of the topics up for debate so far:


* [Is this much choice really a good thing?](http://www.freesoftwaremagazine.com/node/2247)
* [Emulating proprietary software - should we do it?](http://www.freesoftwaremagazine.com/node/2246)
* ["Free software", "open source", "FOSS", or other?](http://www.freesoftwaremagazine.com/node/2245)
* [Non-free repositories: should they be allowed?](http://www.freesoftwaremagazine.com/node/2244)
* [Should philosophy and ethics be kept out of software?](http://www.freesoftwaremagazine.com/node/2243)
* [Non-free drivers - good or bad?](http://www.freesoftwaremagazine.com/node/2242)
* [GNU/Linux or just Linux?](http://www.freesoftwaremagazine.com/node/2241)

Okay so let us know what you think about these topics and, if you think of another topic that you think should be discussed, post a comment [here](http://www.freesoftwaremagazine.com/node/2248).
