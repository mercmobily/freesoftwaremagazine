I am running Ubuntu Server 6.10, kernel 2.6.17-10, and I removed lp, parport_pc, and parport. I have successfully compiled parlelport.ko and I can verify that the module has loaded with:\r\n$ cat /proc/ioports\r\n..\r\n0378-0378 : parlelport\r\n\r\nThe circuit shows many lights blinking at boot time. After boot, bit-2 and bit-3 stay lit. They remain that way until the computer is rebooted -- or until the monitor goes to sleep. All lights go black while the monitor sleeps. The only response I can generate is that bit-1 lights after inserting parlelport.ko. It stays lit until the computer is rebooted.\r\n\r\nThe only thing that looks suspicious is this:\r\n\r\n$:~/dev$ make -C /usr/src/linux-source-2.6.17 M=`pwd` modules\r\nmake: Entering directory `/usr/src/linux-source-2.6.17'\r\n  CC [M]  /home/sam/dev/parlelport.o\r\n/home/sam/dev/parlelport.c:31: warning: initialization from incompatible pointer type\r\n..\r\n\r\nLine 31 corresponds to: \r\nwrite: parlelport_write\r\n\r\nBut my parlelport_write() is the same as the tutorial's.\r\n\r\nAny pointers?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nSam"

Despite my efforts my network card only works in 2.4.20-8SMP and when I compile the drive in this mode it will not run on the embedded target. The solution currently is to reboot after every build into the 2.4.20-8SMP, which is not great. \r\n\r\nI will look into fixing the network card problem but I am quit interested in learning how to compile drivers for versions of the OS not currently running (and especially in 2.4). I cannot seem to find much on the net so if anyone knows where to look or can help it would be much appreciated."

    hostname: 59.162.23.19
    created: '1265624893'
    body: "Firstly, let me say...this is an awesome tutorial but the only thing missing out here is an elaborate procedure to unload the driver which is present by default on all systems having a parallel port. For some reason rmmod/modprobe did not work out here and the solution as someone has pointed out in one of the earlier comments is to modify the startup scipt to NOT load the parallel port driver at startup. In Ubuntu, I used the following steps to unload the driver during startup and now it works brilliantly:\r\n\r\nSteps to unload paralel port driver:\r\n1. Make the following changes in the /etc/rc1.d :\r\n    K80cups:      modprobe -q lp || true\r\n    K80cups:      modprobe -q ppdev || true\r\n    Uncomment the above 2 lines of the scripts\r\n2. Make the following changes in the /etc/rc2.d :\r\n    S50cups:      modprobe -q ppdev || true\r\n    S50cups:      modprobe -q lp || true\r\n    Uncomment the above 2 lines of the scripts\r\n3. Add the following lines to the file /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf:\r\n    blacklist ppdev \r\n    blacklist parport_pc\r\n    blacklist parport\r\n    blacklist lp\r\n    Restart PC at this point\r\n4. Unload the remaining modules manually using rmmod (if any)\r\n5. Follow remaining instructions given in the tutorial\r\n6. Load custom module (sudo insmod parlelport.ko)\r\n\r\nHope this helps...\r\n\r\nCourtesy: Redmond who has posted one of the earlier comment"
