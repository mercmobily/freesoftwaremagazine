    body: "The crocodile tears being shed are for people who have been priviledgded all along. When you want to use the websites that perform so well in the USA or Europe in Africa, you will find that it is really slow. When you then see what you have to pay in absolute terms compared to what is normal in Europe and the USA, you will agree that there is no neutrality there.\r\n\r\nWhen you then compare the cost of Internet in relation to disposable income, you understand why an African Wikipedia for instance does not happen.\r\n\r\nNet neutrality, sure it is worth fighting for but the fight is much bigger than just your home turf.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n    GerardM"
