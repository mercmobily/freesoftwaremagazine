Those outside the group can do nothing.  The initial \"2\" sets the \"sticky bit\" for the group permissions.\r\n\r\nchmod 2660 -R /games_dir\r\n\r\nWIthout these ownership and permissions settings, whenever I saved pictures from my wifes account to /pictures I'd be unable to edit them later.

They would instead use a guest account running from the same screen.  \r\n\r\nI know there's the possibility of running multiple X servers, but this seems cumbersome.\r\n\r\nCosmo Lee\r\ncosmolee at bigfoot dot com"
