# Poll Results—Would you pay for access to an ad free version of Free Software Magazine?

This poll was a little contentious, and more for our information-gathering than for your interest! However, we did receive some interesting comments and suggestions as to what you, the readers, want. Read more [here](http://www.freesoftwaremagazine.com/polls/would_you_pay_for_an_ad_free_fsm) and stay tuned for...


# This fortnight’s poll

[Dell has announced Linux laptops. NOW, when a friend says “I want need a new PC”, and he doesn’t want a game machine, do you:](http://www.freesoftwaremagazine.com/polls/dell_ubuntu_advice_to_friends)

If a non-tech-savvy friend/relative wants to buy a new machine, what will you do? Do you think this Dell/Ubuntu option is the best way to go or should they go with a Mac or a Windows box. Let us know how you feel by voting and commenting.


# Reminders

**Comments**

Your comments on articles, issues, and blog entries are very welcome. They provide other readers with insightful suggestions, further information, and the feeling that they are not alone. They also provide our authors with the feeling that they are being heard. Please comment wherever possible and **don’t forget to log in** so that you’ll be in the running to win the [latest book competition](http://www.freesoftwaremagazine.com/blog/1).

**Avatars**

Avatars are a great way of expressing your personal identity, whether it be a photo or an image that you feel represents the you you want to be. Read more about avatars [here](http://www.freesoftwaremagazine.com/node/1713). To add an avatar: log in, go to “my account” in the menu on the left, go to the “edit” tab and scroll down to where it says “Upload picture”. Now, hit the browse button, find the image on your computer that you want to upload and go to the bottom of the page and hit the submit button. That’s it; you now have an avatar image.
