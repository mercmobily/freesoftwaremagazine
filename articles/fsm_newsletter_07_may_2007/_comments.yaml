    body: "It's been a great start to trace and learn deep inside the GNU/ Linux stuff. And I just a newbie in Linux. Interested to learn and browse many subject made me jump to your site. It's really help me a lot.  But I found it's not so practical to click \"next\" to \"next\" to read and view a one article. Why I couldn't find a PDF version or some style like the Sony Learning 101 do in their website to View in \"A whole document\". That's just my input. Bravo to the editor and contributors.\r\n\r\nregards,\r\nsehat tan "
