    body: "My kids (7 and 5) love this program and indeed it helps them not only with their maths but their typing too. It's a natural progression from and companion to GCompris.\r\n\r\nIt's probably worth giving a hat-tip to [Tux4Kids](http://tux4kids.alioth.debian.org/) the people behind TuxMath. The same stable also produces TuxTyping which has a similar basis but with an obvious difference. They also produce the excellent and much-loved TuxPaint. All these are available for other platforms including FreeBSD.\r\n\r\n\\-\\-  \r\nEquitas IT Solutions - fairness, quality, freedom  \r\n[http://www.equitasit.co.uk](http://www.equitasit.co.uk)"
