    body: "I tend to disagree with these terms that describe the supporters of proprietary software for Linux as reasonable \"pragmatists\" while the supporters of free software are labeled as mentally disturbed \"religious fanatics\".\r\n\r\nThere's also another way of looking at the issue. The logic of the marketplace insists that Linux distros should offer various \"value-added\" proprietary components and proprietary applications if they want to successfully compete with the other distros for popularity. But the same logic also suggests that when the other distros also add proprietary bits, your distro should add even *more* proprietary stuff to remain competitive. This approach effectively creates an evil circle where all proprietary software is considered good while all free software is considered bad.\r\n\r\nBut free software has several advantages when compared to proprietary software. Some say that free software is a very effective way to develop software because the developers get a lot of feedback from users and they also receive improvement patches made by other software developers. And the developers of Linux distros can fix \"bugs\" in free software but their hands are tied when there are problems in proprietary software because they have no access to the source code. And if some free software developers suddenly decide to stop developing their programs, other developers can continue developing those programs because the source code is available. This is not possible with proprietary software.\r\n\r\nIn other words, free software offers users many long-term benefits that proprietary software lacks. Yes, I agree that sometimes proprietary software can offer some short-term convenience that is not yet available in the similar free software programs. But is choosing shot-term convenience instead of long-term benefits really pragmatism? Or is it just shortsightedness and opportunism? Personally, I tend to think that valuing long-term benefits over shot-term convenience should actually be called pragmatism.\r\n\r\nYou mention the flash videos on youtube as an example where proprietary software works better than free software. Happily, there's good news on that front: the next version of gnash (a free software replacement of the proprietary flash player) should support youtube. And sun's java is planned to be open-sourced. And when Linux becomes more popular as a desktop OS, there will be more pressure for hardware manufacturers to provide open source drivers -- at least, there would be if Linux users prefer the manufacturers that provide free software drivers whenever they buy new hardware.\r\n\r\nAs a conclusion, I'd say that supporting free software is not religious zealotry -- it's very rational pragmatism!"

I believe Linux is better than Windows.  But I also have the patience to keep working with Linux when I run into a challenge getting it to do what I want.  I don't think the average desktop user while go for that.  How do you persuade a person using Windows to switch to Linux when they are used to watching DVD's, listening to mp3 tracks, gaming, etc with no problems on Windows, but have to sacrifice some of those capabilities buy using Linux with no proprietary/non-free software?"

This tends to be because Debian  provides so many different GUI and application options, and with each distribution it seems that different ones win out in the task selections. So, I usually wind up with a quite different system every time I install it.\r\n\r\nLately, I've learned to just do the minimal install, and then use apt-get to install the packages I already know I depend on. This works, but it requires a very fine level of management, so it's not really easy.\r\n\r\nI think this may be one reason why commercial distributions are often favored for new users -- there's a lot more consistency and so you really know what you mean when you say an \"Ubuntu system\", whereas a generic \"Debian desktop system\" could mean any of a large number of different combinations. That probably contributes to the \"geek\" reputation. After all, as a techie, I quite like the variety of choices, but it's not hard for me to see how it could be daunting to a newbie."

On the plus side the KDE desktop is not branded and I could setup panel apps etc. completely as I wanted them.\r\n\r\nThe next problem I had was the paranoia about free in the Debian definition, which is not the same as most peoples idea of free. Iceweasel for example is hawked as being the same as firefox, but it isn't, for me it is totally unusable as none of the extensions I use work and of course flash doesn't work on 64 bit and the easy option of installing a 32 bit firefox for the occasion when flash is needed is not an option as Debian have not yet worked out how to do a multiarch install without using chroot which just complicates things. Also I cannot easily use 32 bit Adobe Acrobat Reader, mscorefonts and many other apps that I need to, there are Debian free versions of some of these but none that do everything I need.\r\n\r\nIn short I do not like the way Debian is restricting my choice of what software to run, I appreciate their ideals but not the implementation. I need a computer that just works, so I can do what I get pleasure/reward from, it has taken me 4 weeks to get to the point where half of my requirements work and I am now fed up with jumping through hoops for Debian, I know I can get 90% of a working box in 2 hours with other distros and 100% in about 2 more hours after I have built new binaries for the stuff that has no prebuilt ones.

But as someone wrote, it looks like you are not compatible with Debian basic rules which Debian HAS to live by.  Free is more than just free beer.  This is why others can base there distributions on Debian subsets (like Ubuntu and Mepsi etc).\r\n\r\nI would sugest that you don't complain on Debian that Adobe, nVidia et all don't give specifications that we can use to program free alternatives, or distribute 64-bit versions of their software.  Complain at the source of the problem. Especially when you don't give any examples and you already made your choise up.  Critics is usefull, but bashing is not.\r\n\r\nAbout initial software selections, like in KDE, there as many \"good\" or \"bad\" selections as it is permutations of softwares.

It is even worse as there are many fine points with the distro that I will miss, but as I said using the box is more important to me than tinkering with the setup.\r\n\r\nFor information, I have been using 64 bit for 4 years, I see it as a backward set to go back to i386, and I regularly contact Adobe and other sources of software to ask for 64 bit versions, I also contact content providers who use non 64 bit compatible software (e.g. BBC) to get them to ask for compatibility from their side. If other users and content providers did this more often perhaps there would be some improvements.\r\n\r\nWhatever happens Etch is going from my desktop, whether it is replaced by Fedora 7, Gentoo or Freespire is not yet decided.

    body: "This is an interesting thread.\r\n\r\nWhen I started on linux I only understood the \"free as in beer\" element; suse 9.0 was better than windows 98, and free, so I was happy. I could even easily install proprietary drivers/codecs etc without really knowing what was happening under the bonnet. Problem was, when it didn't work, I still had no idea what was going on under the bonnet. Luckily, because the software was free (as in really free) there was a knowledge base which was freely accessible (in both senses) on linux forums. I became empowered to fix my own problems with the help of others. I also grew to understand the ethics of free software. The novell/microsoft agreement caused me to ditch \"open\"suse  and use Debian.\r\n\r\nLets take a step back though. Lets imagine that Linux is a proprietary system. I would never have been able to get \"under the hood\", as the the owners of the intellectual property concerned would prevent that. Lawful access to Linux code would presumably depend on purchasing the right to do it, if it was allowed at all. Widespread development of Linux code would cease, security flaws would be concealed from the end user (save on the circumstances where market forces could compel the owners of linux to release them) and the knowledge base which I tapped into to would simply evaporate, meaning that I would have very limited control over my system. We can safely assume that a proprietary linux system would support less hardware than Vista (unless a corporation with a development budget comparable to redmond took it on). We can also assume that DRM would be a central feature of any modern linux distro (if the os is proprietary, why not everything else?). In other words, all we would have is a unix based clone of windows. Incidently, this would mean that any public body/school/hospital in any of the non-trillion dollar economies (meaning nearly all of them) would find the costs of implementing IT prohibitive, unless they wanted to divert ridiculous proportions of their GNP to US/European based software houses. \r\n\r\nI can understand that many users want 3d graphics on their pcs; I would like 3d on my pc. However, I don't want linux to get to a point where it will only function in the command line without proprietary software. I hope that Debian et al will continue to resist \"property creep\" into linux.\r\n\r\nAutomatix is an anathema to free software. For reasons related to the above, and the fact the it does something which any user with the ability to google \"debian libdvdvcss\" can do themselves. It is a profoundly disempowering piece of software which has the effect of giving the new user a system full of proprietary code before they have even attempted to live without it.     \r\n\r\nMy advice to anyone who is new to linux is to spend some time living with a free system. I did it, and it's worth it. By all means stuff your pc with proprietary code if you really can't wait for gnash to work with youtube (which it now does), just don't come crying to me when 10 years from now you have to pay a $100 per year to prevent virus from wiping your hard drive and your all of your freinds, colleagues etc have to all spend $300 on \"microsoftlinux-ultimate edition\" so that they can read the spreadsheet that you sent them.   \r\n  \r\n"

    body: "I read your article and I don't want you to misinterpret what I write.  You are probably not a pragmatist in the philosophical sense of the word.  In the context in which you are using the word (a context you have borrowed since it is certainly making its way into many articles) you and others who approach Linux the same way would better be charecterized as simply consumers of content that require proprietary codecs, who will not give up that content, and are unwilling to pay for an operating system that contains all the necessary non-free codecs (aka Windows).  That's fine.  But it is a form of \"market speak\" to call people who want proprietary codecs on Linux, pragmatists.  It is an attempt to disguise one's basic motivations when one is part of a culture which prizes and sells convenience and instant gratification (and I don't mean that in a disparaging way; it is just a description of what is).  One could easily say that those who want proprietary codecs on Linux are simply impatient while those who will wait for unencumbered software are well ... patient. It follows that those who are patient are patient not because they do not want the benefits that proprietary codecs give but rather would prefer that the benefit not be encumbered.  This is hardly religious zealotry except in the computer world where some people hang their integrity on which editor or programming language they use.\r\n\r\nWhere possible, even businesses seek not to be encumbered by another firms licensing and trademark restrictions and the costs associated with them.  Business's however are at a disadvantage in that they are under pressure to perform financially and sometimes they simply license what is needed because in the long run it is good for their business.  If a business is able to take another route, it would be an odd sort of charecterization to say that the business is operating under some sort of corporate religious zealotry.\r\n\r\nAs for those parts of the article that deal with non-free software, it is not your job to determine whether or not that should be in an article.  That is the job of the editor.  And if the editor of Free Software Magazine is liberal when it comes to this then so be it.  After all, it is his/her magazine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

That is becouse the packages are added to the CD:s on a decreasing popularity order.  Most popular packages are first (with their dependencies).\r\n\r\nSo if you don't recompile packages and don't install lots of not so often used software packages, you will only need 1-4 CD (or first DVD).\r\n\r\nDebian don't sell CD's or DVD's.

So this will happen, we will get better support on hardware than Microsoft Windows, which we have today.  Install MS Windows XP on new hardware, and you will have to install new drivers on all new hardware.  In Linux, where it is some support from chip maker, you do have good support from the Linux kernel direct.  No need for extra installer CD with sent with the hardware.\r\n\r\nAnd we are slowly getting there with 3D cards to.  Intel is already supporting Linux with their 3D cards, and AMD is getting there with ATI cards."

Not that I have anything against the pure FOSS approach, when a FOSS software package that's equal to or better than a proprietary package appears, I go with the FOSS package. \r\n\r\nI use OpenOffice in preference to MS Word and a couple of proprietary word processors I've been using. Works better now and has a better UI. IMO, there's room for everyone, with the possible exception of the unsupported Linux newbie in Debian. \r\n\r\nBTW, I would suggest that Debian users who want to get their system working pragmatically start with debconf (KDE > System > DebCentral Config) instead of Automatix. Better to work with something specifically intended to work with Debian.\r\n\r\nThe secrets to opening Debian up to a pragmatic approach is in the /etc/apt/sources.list file. You can add any number of new repositories ( try http://www.apt-get.org ) from sources ranging from individual vendors of proprietary software (I'm viewing this via Opera-Linux... you can get skype that way, too) to adding the non-free (usually proprietary) and even restricted (usually, this means things like libdvdcss which are not supposed to be available to US users) by adding the right \"Debian unofficial\" repositories. Or if you're just looking for multimedia, drop in on http://www.debian-multimedia.org and add their entry to your repository list.\r\n\r\nAnd if that doesn't work, there are some packages that aren't in any repository that can be downloaded directly and installed via dpkg , or you can even convert packages from rpm to deb via the <i>alien</i> utility. (doesn't work on everything, but frankly, I find it amazing that it works at all.)"
