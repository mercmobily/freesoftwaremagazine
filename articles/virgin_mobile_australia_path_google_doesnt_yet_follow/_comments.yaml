    body: "Hello Tony,\r\n\r\nI have come across your article (thanks to the wonder of Google's technology) and would like to apologise on behalf of Virgin Mobile Australia for the problems that you have had.\r\n\r\nI am emailing your comments to the team in Australia, and to the Virgin Group customer service team, and hope that your outstanding issues can be fully resolved.\r\n\r\nFor your information, each Virgin Mobile around the world (UK, USA, Canada, Australia, France, South Africa and India) has different ownership.  While they were originally started as 50% owned by Virgin Group (where I work) with respective partners, the ownership of the UK (floated then merged with NTL), USA (floated), and Australian businesses have changed over time.\r\n\r\nOptus does own Virgin Mobile Australia, you can see the <a href=\"http://www.optus.com.au/portal/site/aboutoptus/menuitem.813c6f701cee5a14f0419f108c8ac7a0/?vgnextoid=0c02a0473e7b8010VgnVCM10000029867c0aRCRD&vgnextchannel=44b4ce4b55728010VgnVCM10000029867c0aRCRD&vgnextfmt=default  \">press release</a> on the Optus website as of Jan 2006. \r\n \r\nWe have a very strong interest to ensure that every company with the Virgin name meets our high standards of customer service. And although we don't now own the Australian business, we have a very close relationship, and a detailed contract concerning the basis on which the company continues to use the Virgin name. \r\n\r\nCharles\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nNow, this is what I call \"impressive\".\r\nPlease see my email, Charles, and read the update (under which Virgin Australia is not under such a grim light).\r\n\r\nI give you and your staff in the UK full permission to listen to all of the call logs if you like r need them.\r\n\r\nI changed the title slightly, since Virgin Australia doesn't seem to be \"evil\" after all.\r\n\r\nOne note, though: on the site:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.virginmobile.com.au/rates/which_suits.html#monthlyplans\">Plans</a>\r\n\r\nIt looks like people like me, with their own phone, will still have to pay a minimum of $720 if they exit the post-paid plan. I think that really ought to be clearer.\r\n\r\nHowever, overall, I am extremely impressed: you actually created an account and took the time to post here. Rare.\r\n\r\nMerc."

    body: "It's a mistake to trust corporations, or assign _any_ human qualities to them, they are _not_ people.\r\n\r\nCorporations are _machines made out of people_. They insist on precision interchangeability of their parts, so they destroy all of the individuality of their human parts that they can, lest they disrupt the smooth-running rush towards corporate profit. If any one person, right up to the CEO and chairman of the board goes too far towards advocating ethics, morality, or the public good over corporate profits, then the corporate machine is designed to reject (i.e. fire) them.\r\n\r\nTo do otherwise than to seek profit at any cost to society is actually considered _unethical_ by people who advocate from the point-of-view of shareholders (because to do anything for the public good , but against the interest of shareholders is a \"betrayal\" of the shareholders trust). But advocacy or no, the corporation is designed to do this, and the design works.\r\n\r\nIn this formula is both the reason for corporate success and seed of their eventual doom. They are pretty good machines and the relentless pursuit of profit is _usually_ to the benefit of society, contrary to what you might think. It is the surprise at the exceptions (due largely to anthropomorphic expectations) that makes us think otherwise.\r\n\r\nSooner or later, though, we'll build a more intelligent and morally-conscious kind of human machine to replace the corporation. When that happens, it will crush the corporate competition utterly, because it will be that much more powerful (think about it: why are _we_ morally aware? Obviously it was a selective advantage).\r\n\r\nIt is even possible that this has already happened."
