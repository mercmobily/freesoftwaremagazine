There's good news out there for fans of Ubuntu, which is the distro I've been using now for nearly a year: [The Enterprise Edition is due out this week](http://www.zdnet.com.au/news/software/soa/Enterprise_level_Ubuntu_Linux_due_this_week/0,2000061733,39257454,00.htm). Codenamed [Dapper Drake](http://www.ubuntu.com/news/dapperrc), this release should give Ubuntu even more momentum. I'm just hoping they'll stick to their Ubuntu Philosophy: "Ubuntu will always be free of charge, and there is no extra fee for the "enterprise edition", we make our very best work available to everyone on the same Free terms." What confuses me is why they would even need to have a separate "Enterprise" edition. Anyone want to shed some light on that for me?
