<!-- Installing a Debian GNU/Linux test server with VirtualBox -->

There are a number of good reasons for installing a virtual machine on your computer -- as a way to run software that isn't compatible with your primary operating system, as a sandbox for development, or as a place to test package installations, new distributions, or new server configurations. Setting one up with VirtualBox OSE is quite easy.

=TEXTBOX_START=Making Movies with Free Software=
This article is part of an on-going series on the challenges I've faced in producing two free-licensed movies, _Marya Morevna_, through the [Morevna Project](http://www.morevnaproject.org) and [Lunatics](http://lunatics.tv), which we are working on as Anansi Spaceworks.
=TEXTBOX_END=

My website for the _Lunatics_ project is hopelessly out of date, and I need to start doing something about it soon. The first step in cleaning up the mess is to create a test environment on my local computer so I can try out new configurations. The public server is virtual, so it seems completely reasonable to test it on a virtual system locally, and it'll provide isolation from my everyday work on this computer, without having to set up a whole new computer.

It also seems likely that I will need to maintain a Zope/Plone package for Debian now that the 'plone-site' packages has been withdrawn, and a virtual environment is a good choice for doing the packaging. Finally, there are a few i386 architecture packages I can't run on this (AMD64) system, and so it'd be useful to have an i386 architecture available.

# Installation

VirtualBox OSE is a very easy-to-use virtualization tool. It has a GUI interface and installation wizards to help you through the process, so it really doesn't feel like you're doing anything as complicated as setting up a virtual host system on your computer.

=IMAGE=fig_virtualbox_new.jpg=Figure 1: VirtualBox puts a very smooth interface on operating system virtualization (newly installed appearance -- there are no virtual machines defined yet)=

To start, I simply launch the VirtualBox application. On my Debian "Squeeze" system, this is under "Debian"->"Application"->"Emulators." the exact location may vary on your system depending on distribution, version, and/or desktop environment. I then see the empty VirtualBox application, just as in Figure 1.

=ZOOM=A configuration wizard takes me through the steps=

At this point, I can create a virtual machine by clicking "New". A configuration wizard (see Figure 2) takes me through the steps. I name my system; decide how much RAM I want it to use; how much disk space I want; where I want to store the disk space; and so on. The default location for VirtualBox disk images, by the way, is `$HOME/.VirtualBox/HardDisks/`. This is where the image will go if you enter a plain name in the box (but you can specify an absolute path if you want to put it someplace else). I'm happy with the default, so I leave it as it is.

=IMAGE=fig_creating_vm.jpg=Figure 2: A configuration wizard makes setting up a host simply a matter of answering some questions about what you want=

The newly created virtual machine will now appear in the VirtualBox menu, with an appropriate icon (the icon is based on the choice of operating system -- in this case, I've selected "Linux" and "Debian"). Of course, at this point, the virtual system is empty, the equivalent of a newly constructed computer. So the choice of operating system is just a statement of intent at this point.

=IMAGE=fig_newly_created_vm.jpg=Figure 3: The newly-created virtual machine=

To actually install the operating system, I'll need a way to boot the installation medium, so I first need to set the machine up to access the Debian "Lenny" installation CD which I've inserted into the host system's CD-ROM drive. I open the "Storage" settings for the new virtual machine, and on the virtual IDE bus (which initially shows "empty"), I select the host drive from the pull down menu (see Figure 4).

=IMAGE=fig_mounting_cdrom.jpg=Figure 4: In order to install an operating system from CD, it's necessary to map the host's CD-ROM drive to the virtual system=

Once this is done, I can now "boot" the virtual system by clicking on the "Start" button beside the icon for my virtual host. When I do this, the CD-ROM spins up and a few moments later, I get the Debian installation menu (Figure 5).

=ZOOM=Once this is done, I can now "boot" the virtual system by clicking on the "Start" button beside the icon for my virtual host=

Installing the Debian system at this point is exactly like installing it on a real machine. A few points worth noting:

* It reports that there is no other system on the disk and allows me to partition the entire disk. Remember, the installer has no way to know it's on a virtual system -- it's talking about the virtual disk  I created earlier
* Similarly, the Grub bootloader is installed on the virtual disk's master boot record. The messages here may be a little scary, because it sounds as if it's going to wipe the whole system, but of course it's only the virtual machine that it's talking about
* I get some warnings about screen color depth settings -- the machine will work better if the color depth matches the display on the host system
* I get warning notices about the "Mouse Integration". These are just to let me know how to regain control of the mouse if the virtual machine takes it over

=IMAGE=fig_installing_debian.jpg=Figure 5: Booting the virtual machine up with the Debian installation CD=

In my case, I'm planning to set up a test server. So I choose options for the machine that are just like the virtual machine my real server runs on. I also want to install a minimum "standard" installation of packages so that I can control the packages that are installed. As usually, I actually use Debian's "Expert Install" process which asks lots of questions, but gives me more control.

Obviously, if I didn't care about such details, I might be better off to simply use the simple "Install" button which will set many options to appropriate defaults.

=IMAGE=fig_debian_installed.jpg=Figure 6: Booting into Debian for the first time after installation=

And _voila!_ I have a Debian system, exactly as I would normally get on a real computer. What I've installed is Debian "Lenny" for an i386 architecture. This will let me run a few packages that are not available for the Debian "Squeeze" AMD64 system that I have installed natively on this system.

It also will let me set up an uncluttered system for testing what I want to install on my server (and the version will match, since I run the stable installation on my public server). This makes it much easier to avoid accidental dependency problems.

=IMAGE=fig_snapshot.jpg=Figure 7: Creating a snapshot right after installation, so I can go back to this if anything goes wrong later=

The last thing I do as part of the virtual installation is to take a snapshot (see Figure 7). VirtualBox will let me revert the system back to this snapshot, so it serves as a quick way to recover from problems if I screw something up after installation (or if I just need to start over to check something).

=ZOOM=The last thing I do as part of the virtual installation is to take a snapshot=

In a testing environment, this kind of perfect repeatability is highly desirable. I'll save snapshots before each major configuration change. That way, I can back up and make corrections if I think they're necessary.

Naturally, I can run as many virtual systems as my host system's resources will allow. When they aren't running, they don't consume RAM, so I can easily have several stored systems for different applications. That will allow me to keep separate virtual systems for separate tasks -- such as the web server prototyping I'm planning to do, Debian package development, or running software that requires a different system than what is installed on the host.

Virtualization is much more convenient than other options, such as multiple boot, and VirtualBox makes it even easier to set up.
