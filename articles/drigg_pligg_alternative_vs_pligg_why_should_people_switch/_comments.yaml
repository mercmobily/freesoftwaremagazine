    body: "> Plus, choice is good in free software. Right?\r\n\r\nWell _I_ would agree wouldn't I? ;o)\r\n\r\n[Free software alternatives: What good is choice if you don't use it](http://www.freesoftwaremagazine.com/columnss/free_software_alternatives_what_good_choice_if_you_dont_use_it)\r\n\r\nSeriously - a well thought out piece. In the one I link to above I talk about people thoughtlessly picking the first option they've heard of and certainly that could be the case here. I note where you mention the fanfare accompanying Pligg releases and the comparative quiet when Drigg \"slips out\".\r\n\r\nThis will be a contributory factor in why one project gets chosen over another. In the end we can but hope that people will do proper research when picking.\r\n\r\nI've used neither so I can't really comment on which is best - other than sucking up to the editor of course :o) But one statement in your post rings out and would be a factor if I ever need to choose:\r\n\r\n> Drigg will always, always remain free. Itâ€™s released under the GPL, _and will always be._\r\n\r\ncheers  \r\nRyan"

    body: "I think Drigg is the best user-moderated-forum software available. In my opinion, Drigg is also the most relevant and useful application of Jeff Eaton's Voting API. I've sought software like Drigg for years. \r\n\r\nYou can follow the evolution of the user-moderated forum software from SlashCode to Scoop, to Pligg and now Drigg. Drigg is the most advanced, hands down. \r\n\r\nI would say that with Free Software Magazine, Free Software Daily and Drigg that it's clear that Tony Mobily is an entrepreneur to watch. \r\n\r\nChoosing \"Free Software\" rather than \"Open Source\" branding was a critically important choice. \r\n\r\nChoosing to build a user-moderated forum was a great idea. Choosing to base it on Drupal was another great idea. \r\n\r\nNow you just need to get the attention of a few bloggers who have a big following. I have a few in mind..."

The good work has continued even while free software has been over-shadowed by the corporate-assimilated \"open source\" brand and it's advocates.\r\n\r\nDrigg is software I'll be using in the future. I have an environmentalism and sustainable-technology group-blog I'm working on. \r\n\r\nI other ideas for it as well. I know some guys who are widely-read bloggers who are activists for civil liberties and social responsibility. \r\n\r\nI'd like to see the \"blogosphere\" rejuvenated by the availability of this new software and the OpenID integration of Drupal. \r\n\r\nThe earliest and largest blogs have consolidated almost all the traffic, forming something of a blogger aristocracy. Now disruptive technology is required to give new voices a chance to be heard."

    body: "It's a mistake to measure the success of free software projects by their \"market share\". Market share, as such, is only useful if you need to make money by selling software-related services.\r\n\r\nWhat you need is a sufficiently large and motivated development community around your project (or to put it another way, a [sufficiently large _effective_ bazaar size](http://www.mibsoftware.com/bazdev/0003.htm)). That's what keeps it growing and improving. And if you were mainly creating the project so that you (and similarly motivated people) can use it, then that's all you need.\r\n\r\nBy comparison, the number of \"end users\" is much less important.\r\n\r\nAs you point out, you may have less traffic on help lists, simply because your product is lower maintenance!\r\n\r\nThe goal of a free software project should be \"independence\", not \"domination\". You are not harmed by other people's success.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    body: "I agree with Terry. There is a parallel to be drawn with the non-profit sector, specifically charities, here.\r\n\r\nCharities don't have competitors in the way businesses understand them. Whilst it's possible for charities to overlap with each other, they generally have enough diversity in their purpose to co-exist without conflict. The purpose of a charity is - usually - to address a specific set of needs. Sometimes those needs are a sub-set of another charity's but that still works. The purpose of a business is to generate profit and often that will involve beating the competition. Where one business addresses a subset of another's market you will still find the two in conflict.\r\n\r\nSome free software projects can be seen to be similar to charities in that they don't have to compete with each other in the way that proprietary software products  would. The good ones can co-exist because they address slightly different needs or the same need with different approaches. The smart ones recognise a need for them to co-exist and don't waste time saying how much worse the \"opposition\" is. The _really_ smart ones concentrate on producing good software not grabbing headlines. That looks like where Drigg has been until now and - for your sanity - it should probably continue that way.\r\n\r\nThere's nothing wrong with a project wanting to be the best scratch for a particular itch or gaining a strong user base but neither really translate into \"gaining market share\". There is as we know a world of difference between \"best\" and \"most-popular\" and when a free software project focuses on the number of users I find it tends to lose touch with the reason it started."

I am happy with it anyway :-D I would love to see more developers joining in -- drigg is a very easy project to actually work on as a team.\r\n\r\nNow that I upgraded to version 24, which breaks a few things, we'll see how many people will complain in the forums! No wait, I wrote the upgrade scripts so that they fix everything, and even warn you about methods that changed names... oh well! :-D\r\n\r\nMerc."

    body: "Having lots of end users is good. That can lead to a larger developer community. It can also bring in donations and consulting income.\r\n\r\nAlso, in a finite market, you can't let competition open up too large of a lead in market share or there won't be room for your project to grow.\r\n\r\nIn this case, Tony is in good position. He should enjoy an advantage among developers and contributors because he made a better design choice - building on top of Drupal.\r\n\r\nHe does need to get the word out that his software is the best for Digg-style websites (user-moderated forums). \r\n\r\nDirectly comparing Drigg to Pligg may not be the best idea for marketing but it can't be avoided that both the Drigg and Pligg projects are entrepreneurial efforts offering similar functionality in the same market. \r\n\r\nSorry to be so disagreeable."

    body: "As popular as Digg.com is, it is not the best user-moderated forum for user interaction.\r\n\r\nScoop as it implemented at DailyKos is the best I know of for user-interaction but the source code is kept secret, and regardless, the public version of scoop is not much fun for developers and site admin. \r\n\r\nThere are two main problems with Digg.com:\r\n\r\n1) You could have a very controversial story. 105 people give positive feedback. 100 people give negative feedback. I would only see +5. It would be better to display 105/100. I think there may be an option for that in Drigg, but it should be default.\r\n\r\n2) You can't see a list of names and whether they rated a story up or down in each comment. With Scoop, you see who rated any given comment up or down which protects the site from the equivalent of ballot stuffing. You can say \"Hey, you guys always vote in a group and you always agree. What gives?\"\r\n\r\n3) The lists of people who've given feedback should be hidden divs on the same page as the content and all the comments.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, Digg is not the standard-bearer for the user-moderated forum. It's DailyKos which can be and has been kept proprietary because of the SaaS loophole.\r\n\r\nWhen I use Drigg, I'm going to be hacking it to behave like that private version of Scoop, because when people can see how everyone rated every comment, the flame-wars are much juicier. Also, I probably don't want it to look like Digg.com, but that's easy enough to change.\r\n\r\nThe reason Drigg is the best in my opinion is because it's well designed and Drupal-based. It has the content recommendation and role-promotion actions. It is as close as I can get to what I want at this point, so it's a great starting point. \r\n\r\nDrigg is also great for developers and site administrators, while the public version of Scoop is lacking the features of the private DailyKos version, and not fun for developers and administrators.\r\n\r\nSince I don't consider the Digg website or the Pligg project to be very interactive, I have to agree with Terry, that the success of Pligg doesn't really affect Drigg which has the potential to be much more disruptive since it's well-designed and Drupal-based.\r\n\r\nFinally, socially-liberal political bloggers seem like the best end-user market to me because people want something like the proprietary version of Scoop at DailyKos. You can see the software which is similar but not very good at these sites:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.kuro5hin.org\r\nhttp:/www.myleftwing.com \r\nhttp://www.docudharma.com\r\n"
