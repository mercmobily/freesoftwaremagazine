On the same basic concept, as a copy of Worms, there is Wormux.\r\nScummVM: is actually the engine developped by LucasArts for games such as Day of the Tentacle and Sam & Max Hit the Road.\r\nCrystalSpace: seems interesting. Ogre3D: I've seen it evolve, it is a very interesting concept which has been validated professionally. However those are engines; I've mentioned Cube and Cube2: they are engines, but they come with complete Free games.\r\n---\r\nA computer is like air conditioning: it becomes useless when you open windows."

    body: "\"ScummVM: is actually the engine developped by LucasArts for games such as Day of the Tentacle and Sam & Max Hit the Road\"\r\n\r\nJust to be clear, it's a free software reimplementation of the engine. I think some of the original developers have been surprised it works with all the games it does, as originally they kept reimplementing it rather than using the same engine for the games. It has their blessing, but not their code. "

    body: "Unfortunately, Sauerbraten isn't free (as in freedom) software as you've suggested. The game engine is, but the rest of the game isn't (see the bottom of http://sauerbraten.org/README.html). I think the same might be true for Cube, but I'm not sure. I can't find that out from the website, but in the README in the source code, it reads \"Game media included in the cube game (maps, textures, sounds, models etc.)\r\n are not covered by this license [the zlib licence], and may have individual copyrights and\r\n distribution restrictions (see individual readmes)\". I can't find any of those \"individual readmes\", so I can't find out if the whole game is free software.\r\n\r\nOne completely free software game I've found to very good (after trying it out in Windows) is Tremulous, though it's network-only. However, I can't play any games which require 3D acceleration on my GNU/Linux system without using any proprietary software, because there's no free driver which allows that for my graphics card.\r\n\r\n--\r\nGNU - free as in freedom"

    hostname: 217.17.115.175
    created: '1175611871'
    body: "I don't think there's a particularly big problem in using the GPL for the \"game media\" such as artwork and sounds. There's something about this on the GNU website at http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#GPLOtherThanSoftware. If anything, I think it might be too restrictive or confusing for the user, because of the \"source code\" requirements, rather than allowing people to circumvent the copyleft provisions. I think the game media of most GPL'd or LGPL'd games is under the same licence as the rest of the game. The non-software parts could also be put under a free licence which is more appropriate for them, for example, the media for Tremulous is all under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike Licence.\r\n\r\nIt's true that you can distribute the game media for Sauerbraten, and you can get the copyright holder's permission to distribute modified versions (as you can with all copyrighted material), but that doesn't mean it's free as in freedom. Although it's strictly not software, it's an integral part of the game, and it's needed to play it, so I don't think the game should be described as free software. I definitely agree that the game engine is free software though.\r\n\r\n--\r\nGNU - free as in freedom"
