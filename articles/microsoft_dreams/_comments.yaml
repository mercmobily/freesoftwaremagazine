    body: "10 black garbed soldiers, ominous and armed to the teeth, with neo-FAST logos emblazoned upon their backs, arrive one morning to confront the MD at the head office of KarBuntu Motors (R&D).\r\n\r\nTheir squad leader, a combat trained, Auto-GPL lawyer, is met by the MD.\r\n\r\nMD: Can I help you?\r\n\r\nSL: We're here to discover the designs and other IP involved in your enhancement of the Kubuntu automobile framework due to your violation of the Auto-GPL in one key area.\r\n\r\nMD: But, we've always been most careful. All purchasers of KarBuntu products are always given full documentation, and Auto-GPL licenses to free use of all our designs and IP, for the unconstrained modification, reproduction and sale of our vechicles.\r\n\r\nSL: Did you or did you not allow Gil Bates of 3 Acacia Gardens, to test drive your latest prototype?\r\n\r\nMD: Yes...\r\n\r\nSL: He is therefore entitled to unobfuscated copies of all the designs involved in the development of the prototype.\r\n\r\nMD: But no, surely not. We haven't even been paid yet for the years of research we done, by the KarBuntu Users' Finance Company. He's contracted to test drive them, and thus exempt from obtaining copies of the design.\r\n\r\nSL: It seems there was no such contract. You have supplied an Auto-GPL licensed vehicle to an end user, for their domestic use.\r\n\r\nMD: Oh dear. So what happens now?\r\n\r\nSL: Because of your non-compliance in failing to disclose documentation to him at the time he came into possession of the vehicle, its designs and IP are now forfeit, to be delivered immediately to this discovery envoy, whereafter we will publish them on your behalf for the benefit of all.\r\n\r\nMD: But, we'll go bankrupt! All our staff are depending upon the sale of our R&D to pay off our costs.\r\n\r\nSL: You should have been more careful.\r\n\r\nMD: And what if we resist?\r\n\r\nSL: We will take it from you.\r\n\r\nMD: And what if you don't find it, or it's encrypted?\r\n\r\nSL: You and all your staff will be persuaded to retrieve or decrypt it at leisure in our Cuban IP recovery facility.\r\n\r\nMD: Can't you just wait until we get paid for it?\r\n\r\nSL: IP is theft. You should know that by now."

    body: "That's true, but we tended to loosely identify the whole Soviet block as being \"Russia\" at one time. This is a bit like calling US citizens \"Americans\" when they actually occupy only a fairly small section of the American land-mass, although in the case of the Soviet States they were all part of the same political entity, like it, or not.\r\n\r\nIt's interesting to note that the technologically advanced Germans degenerated to the standard of producing the likes of the Trabant, after such a few years as part of the Soviet monopoly, while the free competition that was allowed to continue, just a few miles away in West Germany, was producing highly advanced vehicles like Porsche and Mercedes.\r\n\r\nThis helps demonstrate the bad effect that the Microsoft monopoly has been having on the development of software. Monopolies will always tend to discourage technical advancement by their very nature."

    body: 'Is Microsoft afraid to open code to public scrutiny because so much of it has been "borrowed" or otherwise stolen from any source, including Linux? It is no secret that Microsoft paid Apple for the use of the "Windows" GUI and for Apple Talk. Internet Explorer originated as freeware, decades ago. I would like to see an impartial audit of Microsoft software - not likely to happen while Microsoft is so generous with gifts of money (better known as bribes).'

    body: "...and I'm not sure that identifying trabant with USSR was worth it: trabant cars polluted a lot, were far from being fuel efficient, and quite difficult to maintain considering how simple they were. In that sense, a Lada would have been a much, much better comparison: simple yes, but also reliable to the extreme.\r\n\r\nOther 'simple' cars such as the VW bug (modular and reliable) or the Citroen 2CV (polyvalent and modular) would have been much better metaphors for Free Software.\r\n---\r\nA computer is like air conditioning: it becomes useless when you open windows."
