    body: "<cite>FOSS is not strong, its basically a statictical error.</cite>\r\n\r\nThe true power of Free Software does not lie on the statistics (alone) but on the shear political force that is happening.  You'll never see a political and philosophical movement that is utterly wrong but stays for almost 2 decades and manages to survive; this proves that Free Software isn't wrong (by any degree).  It survives not because of funding or corporate decisions but because people still continue to support it despite the FUD and ridicule that it had received (and is still receiving) through the years.\r\n\r\n<cite>sad but true is when you pay (programmers) peanuts, you get monkeys (programmers)...</cite>\r\n\r\nYou seem to have the misconception that the FREE in Free Software means gratis or free of charge.  Free Software is free as in freedom.  Freedom as in you get to control the software that you use on computers that YOU own.  Control here doesn't mean only to use but also to modify and redistribute.  Notice that this does not have to be incompatible with commercialization.  Free Software can also be commercial.  It's just that common people see (superficially) inferior business models with regards to Free Software.  But this is changing in a (slow) but steady state; many businesses are seeing the potencial of Free Software and free flow of information in general.  This is one of the reasons why Free Software is strong; it is slow (probably because it's radical) but it's disruptive (probably why many whine ;).  Also, because the source code is available in Free Software, you get to choose the developers you would like to work for the software you are using; you are not locked down to a particular software company/developers.\r\n\r\n<cite>all we want is commercial grade software, we'll pay for quality, but we will not NOT EVER use rubbish, free or not.</cite>\r\n\r\nHow about you invest the money you pay for proprietary software to hire the programmers developing for a Free Software?  That way you get quality software and receive software that you control forever.  This is now working with Free Software such as GCC, MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.\r\n\r\n<cite>FOSS may one day gain a market share higher than statistical error, but its not going to happen until you start to produce something of quality, and innovation.\r\nthese are to keys to software success, clearly FREE is not good enough, as if it was, everyone would be using FOSS.. but they are not.\r\n\r\nI wonder how long you will fall behind the world before this comes clear to you all. i hope its soon, as i would like to see FOSS progress too.\r\n\r\nbut mostly i want quality software, and FOSS is falling badly behind in quality.\r\n\r\nthis is not new to the FOSS movement, what is clear is that they still believe all they have to do is be FREE. but free rubbish is still rubbish, its stuff you throw away, or use if you have no choice, thankfully we have a choice, and its clear the vast majority of the world have spoken with their votes for qualty over price.</cite>\r\n\r\nGenerally, I hate people who whine like this but spend dough in proprietary software.  If you use Free Software why don't you pay/donate for it?  All those people who use Free Software and just whine are most likely those people who are free loading.  Yes, you'll get quality software in Free Software but you'll also have to give the software developers a way of living.  Don't demand if you are just free loading.  We don't need fanatics, we need supporters that KNOW and UNDERSTAND Free Software before they whine.\r\n\r\n<cite>BTW: ive purchased many many computers, and NEVER have i been forced to use ANY Operating system. its NOT forced on me, its a choice i make.\r\n\r\nchoice is a great thing, if FOSS thinks destroying competition and removing OUR CHOICE is a good thing that will be supported by the WORLD,, they are just plain wrong..</cite>\r\n\r\nContrary to these statements, Free Software isn't destroying competition, rather it is creating one.  Proprietary software has this characteristic of locking down users (updates difficult, migration difficult, etc.) and hence, creates monopolies (i.e. your beloved Microsoft).  How can Free Software be destroying competition?  I can't quite see your point.\r\n\r\n<cite>FOSS NEEDS MICROSOFT,, where else will it get it's idea from.. as it does not seem capable of self innovation, but very good at copying others innovation.</cite>\r\n\r\nFree Software never needed Microsoft.  Free Software was born before Microsoft became a monopoly.  The whole internet is built on top of Free Software.  Microsoft doesn't own the internet.  Saying that Free Software are only alternatives to Microsoft's is a hasty generalization (a nasty one).  Look at sourceforge and see the shear number of Free Software that are being developed; not even half of them are Microsoft clones.\r\n\r\n<cite>ofcouse you wont agree, and FOSS is the best thing ever, but thats only true if your willing to greatly lower your standards.\r\nif FOSS was half as good as you say,, then half the world would use it.\r\n\r\nnot less than 5% with a 10% margin of error !!</cite>\r\n\r\nOh well.  To each his own.  But at least try to be reasonable.  Know facts before uttering a thing less they'll end as FUD.  Free Software is strong not because it's popular, but because it's sustainable.  If you are annoyed by its presence, I can tell you that you will be annoyed for many years still to come (if not forever)."

Free software is about the <em>liberty to use</em>, <em>liberty to tinker with</em>, <em>liberty to distribute</em> and the <em>liberty to publish modifications</em> of the <em>software we run on our own computers</em>.

Do not think of free as in free beer. \r\n\r\nWith FOSS, <strong>anybody</strong> can take any piece of existing work and tinker with it to improve it for their own requirements. <em>It can be as <strong>high quality</strong> or as <strong>low quality</strong> as needed.

    body: "I think we're missing the point of <em>Anonymous Coward's posting</em>.  A business IT shop has a goal of supporting the business.  Period.  Whatever does not go supporting the goals of the business simply does not get done.  Most businesses run IT very close to the breaking point from a resource perspective.  There simply are not any resources to spend developing FOSS software to meet business needs unless there is nothing else available.(And then it will likely be kept a proprietary)\r\n\r\nTelling IT mgrs that the software can be as good as you want it is simply ignoring his/her needs.

In this case, you should invest some resources (time/money/man power) into improving the software (tinkering with the source code). When it is completed, your investment should result in software that is 100% adequate for your requirements! It will remain adequate until your requirements change and then you'll need to invest more resources into improving the software.\r\n\r\n<cite>that I can get support for when I need it and I'm glad to pay for it. The source code has no value to me. I have no one who has time to understand it.</cite>\r\n\r\nYou don't have to know anything about code. Support for software comes from software consultants and software developers - you can pay them money and they will help you install/configure/use/improve the software. You can hire a full time software developer or contract one temporarily. There are plenty around that that will support you for your money.\r\n\r\n<cite>Telling an IT mgr to give back to the community misses the reality of their resource constraint. There is no time to put the invest and wait for a suitable product.</cite>\r\n\r\nLike I said before, it is a <em>problem that people do not want to invest their resources</em> (time/money/man power) into improving Free Software. People would rather choose to invest resources into <em>somewhat convenient</em> user-subjugating software. When you invest into Free Software, you don't have to give anything back! You are free to keep changes private as Free Software allows for private changes!\r\n\r\n<cite>FOSS has a future. But if the community wants IT shops to increase uptake, it needs to deliver - first. Linux is a good example here.</cite>\r\nFree Software already delivers what is required. If it doesn't deliver what <em>you</em> require, then <em>you</em> should put <em>resources</em> into making this so. However, I'm guessing you feel an investment in Free Software will cost you too much. In the short term, this may be true. In the long term, this is definitely false. \r\n\r\nYou also seem to have some sort of entitlement from the Free Software community to provide you with software that you require. We have no such prerogative to you. We provide the world with no cost Free Software because we want to share it with the world. If our software is inadequate for your requirements, then <em>you</em> should invest some resources into improving it."
