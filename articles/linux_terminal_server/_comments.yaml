    hostname: 68.93.224.4

    body: "These are getting really nice.\r\n\r\nI saw a <a href=\"http://www.norhtec.com/\">manufacturer site</a> recently selling a unit that's about the size of a conventional half-height disk drive (who remember full-height anymore).\r\n\r\nFor something like US$120 each (they're cheaper in quantity), you get a tiny box with a 166MHz+ CPU, 128 MB RAM, a Compact Flash slot (to replace a hard drive), USB, keyboard, serial I/O slots, 2D/Multimedia accelerated graphics, and audio (I don't think it has 3D acceleration). Since they run Puppy Linux on it, it must have Linux drivers for the hardware. Also, it's supposed to run from about 0 to 60 C (32 to 140 F) with no fan and will bolt onto the back of a standard VESA LCD monitor.\r\n\r\n(Note this partially answers the 'graphics intensive' question above -- multimedia applications are supported, but not really 3D).\r\n\r\nIn my experience, you can usually find used CRT monitors for US$40 to US$60, but they're a false economy, because they lose definition over time (\"fuzz out\", I call it) and become unusable in much less than the lifetime of an LCD monitor (provided you don't poke the LCD panel with something -- they really need lexan or glass covers for these things!).  I just found a used 17\" LCD for US$130 from an online shop, which is probably a better deal. $200 is not an uncommon new price if you go to the right suppliers.\r\n\r\nSo, yeah, the client is going to cost US$300â€”but US$200 of that is probably the LCD <i>monitor</i>! Monitors aren't very price-flexible, but fortunately, they last longer and obsolesce slower than most other computer equipment, so they tend to be good investments. I probably upgrade CPUs every 2-3 years, but I hardly ever get rid of monitors.  Keyboards and mice may eventually be a problem, but they're in the US$10 range, so it'll be awhile before they start to impact the flexibility of client prices.\r\n\r\nSo the next step, if any, is to bring down the cost and increase the durability of LCD monitors. Of course, the One Laptop Per Child project (and therefore Quanta) is doing that. I wonder if we'll see spin-off LCD monitors based on the same LCD panel (or same technology).\r\n\r\nThe Open Graphics Project is also really close to manufacturing their first open hardware FPGA prototyping cards. In a year or so, they may be talking about doing the ASIC (consumer-targeted) cards, and selling the chipset to embedded developers, which might well mean inexpensive clients like this with basic 3D acceleration, so you could actually run CAD software (or Blender) over these kind of clients.\r\n "

    hostname: 68.167.146.78
    created: '1158451988'
    body: "Hello folks,\r\n\r\nThere is another turnkey LTSP distribution called K12LTSP, maintained by Eric Harrison (he also contributes to Edubuntu).  K12LTSP came out in, I believe, 2001 and currently has two versions:\r\n\r\n1.)  Fedora Core-based\r\n2.)  CentOS-based\r\n\r\nI happen to use the CentOS-based one at home, and I have a couple of schools using the Fedora-based ones.  Here are some reasons why you might want to consider trying K12LTSP:\r\n\r\nA.)  It supports both EtherBoot *and* PXE-boot simultaneously.  That means all those old Pentium-133's, too, can be used as thin clients, totally seamlessly, right alongside the new PXE-booting thin clients.\r\n\r\nB.)  It also supports not just x86 thin clients, but also Power Mac thin clients, *simultaneously*, on the same network segment (I and several others have verified this!).\r\n\r\nC.)  It's even easier to install a K12LTSP server than it is to install Windows XP, let alone something like Windows Server 2003.  It's all integrated seamlessly into the Red Hat installation process.  Good default settings were chosen, so yes, you can click through all the defaults, and boom, you're done.\r\n\r\nNow, I'm not knocking Edubuntu; I use and demo it myself, and I'm sure glad it's here.  However, K12LTSP has simply been around a few more years and therefore is more mature at this point (e. g. simultaneous EtherBoot and PXE and x86/PMac client support).  Now, Edubuntu can easily be made to do these things, too; it's basically just a tweak to /etc/dhcpd.conf and copying over /opt/ltsp/ppc.  I have tried this, and it does work.\r\n\r\nWith either distro (Edubuntu or K12LTSP), the cost savings are the same, and the benefits are the same.  You'll do well with either, and above all, YOU WILL BE FREE OF THE BSA, MICROSOFT, AND APPLE.  I know; we got hit with an audit, and it wasn't fun."

That means that your graphics-intensive applications should now work just fine if you have an integrated Intel chipset.  Finally, Intel's learning to play nice!\r\n\r\nI recommend that everyone who's looking at buying new thin clients ask the manufacturer if they use an integrated Intel chipset.  Another good option, for those who are using older PC's as thin clients, is the ATI Radeon 7500/8500 (yes, they're still very much around), and the Matrox Millennium G400/G450 (yes, they're around, too).  Both video cards provide quite fast 2-D and 3-D video support.\r\n\r\nSTAY AWAY FROM NVIDIA *ANYTHING*, AS WELL AS ANY RECENT ATI CHIPSET (9200 and greater).  You are limited to the S-L-O-W VESA driver with these chipsets.  The reason is that both ATI and nVidious decided to no longer play nice with the Free/Open Source community and refuse to allow us to write drivers for their chips.  We'll see how long that lasts now that Intel has seen the light; Intel's too big for them to ignore."

Search for LTSP in descriptions of packages for testing at packages.debian.org . ltsp-client-builder is the key. You run it and it creates the LTSP environment on the server for whatever client you want. You have to set up your DHCP server to point the ppc client at the right environment and kernel, I suppose. I have not tried it.\r\n\r\nSo, you can run your LTSP server on AMD64 and serve clients of Pentium I's, ppc, i386, whatever. This is sweet for schools that have working inventory, but the new fanless thin clients and LCD monitors are the way to go sooner or later."

    body: "If you have the new web based version of accelerated reader, then you can access it from linux with the firefox browser. Instructions for this are on Suse's web page. However, if you have the 6.x version of the application, which installs to a workstation, then you are in the same boat I am, and I am trying to find a way to make that work in a thin client environment as well, but I have heard it has been done on linux also.\r\nJ"

    body: 'I am trying to set up a language learning lab I can potentially set up a maximum of 30 thin clients and 15 thick or fat earthnet clients.  My Idea is to have the fats run windows vista Ultima with local licensed software and then use Guadalinux from a dual boot or somekind of virtual machine. I need both so I can teach them at the school running windows 2007 professional software.  The rest of the Thin clients would need to run video, sound, recording etc windows apps.  This may be asking too much for a swap file.  I invision a motherboard with a quad e6600 4 gigs of ddr2 800 ram two 500 gig sataII drives with two  gigabyte nics. two     lan switches with 24 gigabyte ports.  I have installed cat6 gigabyte cable. I was thinking about aquiring miserable used pentium IV and then getting the cheapest lcds I can find for them.  I would like to repacage them though so they all look the same maybe that isn´t such a good Idea maybe in the end a small fanless system would be best. I don`t have a clue how to go about setting this all up which is why I am trying to find out if is do able in the first place.  Any insight would be appreciated thanks'

LTSP is excellent, we also use Windows Terminal Server for the apps that don't run on Linux.\r\n\r\nIt may be worth checking my blog if you plan to setup a thin client network in your school or want to switch to Linux.\r\n\r\nhttp://stephen-walder.blogspot.com/"

I did this to prevent thrashing the HDD for a demo setting where I had the Codebreakers divx playing back on each thin-client, but wondered if the practice had any use in a classroom setting! Unmounting the ramdisk releases the memory, but you can remount it again when needed, giving control over viewing and censoring. '
