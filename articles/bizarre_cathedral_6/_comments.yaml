    body: "I always feel that if I have to explain the joke then the strip has failed but in this case I can see the problem for non-native English speakers.\r\n\r\nThe text on the poster in the third panel is \"Free Soft Drinks\". Perhaps it's a British thing but a soft drink here is -- usually -- some kind of non-fizzy fruit flavoured drink, in Britain this would be generically be called squash but I guess cordial is a similar thing.\r\n\r\nThe idea of the strip is that things RMS read in kindergarten/nursery influenced his later life. So we have :\r\n\r\n* a standard \"it's good to share\" message which seems to be told to all kids of a young age\r\n* an offer of free soft drinks - but obviously the \"free soft..\" bit is the influence\r\n* a dressing up box from which he pulls a long beard..\r\n\r\nOkay it loses it when the joke is written down but  that's why I don't like explaining jokes :o)\r\n\r\nhope this helps anyway  \r\nRyan"
