    body: "I had a portfolio spreadsheet in Excel for doing some investment performance analysis.  It was fairly simple, although had a lot of VBA macro code.  I've moved this to Calc and OO.o Basic with pretty good results.  There were a few things I couldn't figure out how to do.  I think they are possible, but I didn't want to invest a lot of time figuring them out when they weren't showstoppers.  I think it's easier to write code in Excel since the editor has \"hinting\" -- you type a dot and it shows you what is available.  Much quicker to figure out what is available and muddle your way through.  But OO.o Basic does the job, and we can hope the editor improves.  (I'm still using 2.2, so don't know what the latest editor is like.)\r\n\r\nI read on a forum once where someone complained about Calc's performance with charts on large datasets, giving the example of a 2000 row spreadsheet with 2 data sets.  (Let's say dates in col A, and the data sets in col B and C.  You could just put random numbers or incrementing numbers in there.)  I tried -- in 2.2 -- to make a chart for this, and it is abysmally slow, where in Excel it is instantaneous.  I also tried in Gnumeric, which handled it fine.  But the problem for a business of just about any size is that you're not going to want to support multiple solutions depending on the situation.\r\n\r\nFor me at least, OO.o is fine for home use.  I think it would also be good for 96.3% of my work needs, if my company allowed it.\r\n\r\n----\r\nhttp://www.movingtofreedom.org/"

    body: "You've hit on what I've found to be the single missing feature from OpenOffice: mail merge. However, what's really missing here is the ability to send all the merged output to a single document.\r\n\r\nMail merges of the type Word calls \"catalog\" were one of the biggest tricks I used to use to manage data. It's a simple, non-programming way to generate all sorts of repeating data.\r\n\r\nFor example, say you're migrating data from one database to another that has a completely different schema. You export the original data as a CSV file, import it as a spreadsheet, do any manipulation/cleanup you need to do.\r\n\r\nThen, open up Word, create a simple template for what to do with the data: insert this column in one table, insert the next column in a different table. Create a template of SQL statements that represent what you need to do to convert to the new schema. Run the merge, outputting to a catalog, and presto! You've got a script you can feed straight into the new database.\r\n\r\nOr, make a template of HTML for a quick way of building a web page list of items in your spreadsheet. In fact, this is what I was doing when I came up with the technique--building lists of new record albums and artists for a music web site, back in the days of IE 2 and Netscape 2, long before I knew anything about server-side programming. I was actually working at a temp job for Microsoft on their Music Central web site (anybody remember that?), and cutting and pasting artists and albums was supposed to be about 6 hours of my job every week. The first week I spent an hour figuring out how to make mail merge do the trick, and from then on it was 10 minutes a week.\r\n\r\nSure, there's lots of other ways you can do this, writing simple programs or macros. But for me this was a very fast technique I used all the time to convert data. And you can't do it in OpenOffice--it insists on creating a new document for every record.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n-- \r\nJohn Locke\r\nFreelock Computing, http://www.freelock.com\r\nThe Open Source for Business Solutions"

    body: "Our office migrated to OOo at 1.1, so I have helped our receptionist work through many mail merge tricks. I believe the wizards in 2.x are totally useless. The best route I have found is to save your data in dbf (dBase) format. If you won't use very many databases, or will rarely use one twice, save them all in a single folder. Create a database manually that points to the folder for the dBase files. From this point on you can add, remove and replace files in that folder, and they will automatically update in the tables list for that data source.\r\nAfter trying both methods, our receptionist prefers \"Insert -> Fields -> Other -> Database -> Mail merge fields\" to \"F4 -> drag and drop\". She can put her cursor where she wants the field, then click on it and click Insert. She can also format the way the data  will appear (currency, dates, etc.) At this point the letter can be printed normally, and OOo will ask if you want to include the data or just print the letter with field names.\r\nBypassing the wizard does mean a little more complexity when it comes to hiding empty lines (there are lots of howtos about doing it manually - but it would be nice if OOo could do this the way Word 97 did), but you have a lot more control over the finished project.\r\nJohn Locke, I am not sure I followed everything you said, but if it helps I know that  you can use \"Insert -> Fields -> Other -> Database -> Next record\" to start a new record within a single document. This is how OOo does labels.\r\nI'd be happy to answer any other questions about mail merge that I can, especially if they don't involve the wizards. I am always happy to help somebody overcome hurdles to upgrading to the best and cheapest office suite around.\r\n"

    body: "I'm not sure I've ever heard of somebody actually using a word processor to create SQL injection scripts! Sounds a little over the top to me but if it works for you then who am I to stop you.\r\n\r\nAnyway as mecrider says you can insert a Next Record field in a document as OOo does for labels. Once you've done that you can save the merged document as a single document rather than individual ones.\r\nIf you follow the mail merge wizard the final step gives you this option.\r\n\r\nActually this brings me to an advantage that Writer has over Word (at least over 2002). When you merge to a single document and save it. Word creates separate sections for each letter so you can't print pages 3 - 5 without using the print mail merge options. Writer produces a new page for each letter so you can open a saved merged document and print pages 3 - 5 in the same way you would anything else.\r\nWhilst the Word way is not hard is does break from the convention it uses to print page ranges on multi-page documents and IME most users have no clue what a section is anyway.\r\n\r\nAgain another example of the Writer way doing it \"properly\".\r\n\r\ncheers\r\nRyan"

The program could in the end ask if you want to save it for later or discard it.\r\n\r\nI've used OOO since 0.9x and am especially pleased with its stability with large documents containing lots of illustrations and tables.
