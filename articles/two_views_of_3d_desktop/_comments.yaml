Otherwise, it's all just a bunch of pretty graphics used to add appeal to the same old 2D WIMP environment.\r\n\r\nThe same thing is true of Compiz and Beryl: they are a 2.5D view of the world, in that 3D is used only for effect, rather than to add much to usability. Most of the true usability enhancements of the new generation of fancified desktops could be accomplished without 3D at all, like the minimizing effects to show you were your windows went.\r\n\r\nGetting back to LCARS: notice the (fictional) primary interface to the (fictional) LCARS system is still voice. The screens are used to display data, and to augment input. I think this is the way it should be. Keyboards will still be useful, as a bunch of people sitting around talking to their computers will make for a noisy office.\r\n\r\nAt least, that's my assessment. I may be way off."

Funnily, it reminded me of Nintendo's first approach of 3D control: the Power Glove on the original NES/Famicom.\r\n\r\nVoice is an idea, but not for navigation: I'd say it's good for extended data input, but it's too... imprecise for actual navigation, moreover it would be very hard to localize.\r\n\r\nNote, I think there should be a way to add the windows back sticky notes to Compiz/Beryl - modular design and window manager are the only actual requirement for these, but you may want to write one yourself...\r\n---\r\nA computer is like air conditioning: it becomes useless when you open windows."
