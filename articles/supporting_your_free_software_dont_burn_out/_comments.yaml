    body: "This is very sound advice. Both my projects are small-time really and I am the sole developer/maintainer. I get my fair share of \"it doesn't work\" forums posts and I pretty much do what you've suggested without thinking about it. This includes posting a note on the homepages saying that support is available but I have a family and a job so my responses won't be immediate.\r\n\r\ncheers  \r\nRyan"

    body: "Not sure I'd go that far in describing myself :o) I can be as reactive as the next person. In my experience people tend to be a little less demanding if you tell them up front that you are unable to provide instant support. \r\n\r\nActually I find people relate better to any kind of up front information regarding support. What they react less well to is a broken promise - regardless of whether that promise was defined, implied or inferred.\r\n\r\nRyan"
