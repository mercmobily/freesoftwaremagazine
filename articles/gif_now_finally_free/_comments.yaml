    body: "I guess that depends on your definition of \"wildly\".\r\n\r\nPNG is the default and only seriously reliable format used by the Python Imaging Library (i.e. it's basically the \"native\" format). Inkscape only exports bitmaps as PNG. And so on.  And of course, PNG is the *only* widely used format that can represent true-color images without artifacts and data loss (the big problems with JPEG). PNG is my personal favorite for storing bitmaps, and has very good support and fidelity between many different programs (there are a few problems—but I have more trouble with GIFs and JPEGs, due to fundamental limitations of those formats).\r\n\r\nOn the internet, popularity has been less evident, but only because of the extreme conservativism that the existence of older web browsers introduces. Internet Explorer and Mozilla both had significant PNG display bugs until quite recent versions. However, the old versions are dying out, and most of the web-viewing public now views PNGs without even thinking (or probably knowing) about it.\r\n\r\nGIFs remain popular for animation. The MNG standard (the animated version of PNG) never saw much support, and animated GIFs are still the easiest and most portable form of animation on the web (despite the recent surge in Flash popularity).\r\n\r\nThe limitation of GIFs to 8-bit palette graphics, though, is a pretty serious limitation for any serious artwork, and it makes GIFs awkward to use.  I get a lot of mileage from JPEGs, especially by exploiting the characteristics of their lossy compression algorithm (e.g. you can get some cool fringe effects simply by overcompressing the JPEG, and get a smaller file to boot), but JPEG is not a good general purpose format.\r\n\r\nPNG was needed for purely technical reasons. Not to defend Unisys, but I'm actually kind of glad that we had obstacles that pushed us to use a newer and better format (\"it's an ill wind...\").\r\n\r\nI would call PNG a very successful format!\r\n"

If IE7 will support it, then you can obviously appreciate the fact that PNG is far from dead on the web.\r\n\r\nAlso, if you do some reading, you'll see that PNG is a superior format to GIF and JPEG.  Of course, we're talking about image formats developed a decade ago, so it's hardly a fair fight :)\r\n\r\nBe prepared to see a continued rise in the use of PNG.  I recently switched all my images to PNG's for all my web based projects.  Of course, my target markets are very \"techie\" and 98% of them are equipped with the latest browsers (IE7 and Firefox 1.5.0.7).  I'm hoping to convince the other 2% to start upgrading."

I think *you* as a web developer, include it in your pages (so it is downloaded as part of the page), and it makes your page work correctly in IE 5 and 6. So, this is something that would benefit users without them having to do *anything*, and benefits web developers by making it easy (if it works as it claims) to use standard HTML+CSS and have the script take care of making it work correctly in IE5/6. (And the additional overhead for developers can be made quite trivial - I know that, usually, when I'm developing a site, I have a couple standard include files, and one specifically for my head section that includes things like site-wide stylesheet file <link> tags, and the like - just edit such a global 'include' file to also include a <script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"blah\"> tag, and you should be set. \r\n\r\nSeems like a fairly elegant solution, if it actually works.

Perhaps.  (A lot of consumer-grade hardware, such as scanners, use TIFF to a greater or lesser extent.  A lot of people still have BMP images kicking around because they used to be the only format well supported by certain very-widely-used software.  EPS is less obvious, but besides its niche uses (e.g., in prepub) it's also popularly used for consumer clip art e.g. in MS Word, and in a lot of those commercial clip art packages you can buy.  WMF and PCX are also arguable.)\r\n\r\nHowever, PNG use has grown significantly in the last couple of years and is certainly a major image format, probably the third or fourth most widely used at this point.  (JPEG/JFIF is obviously the _most_ widely used at this point; GIF is _probably_ second.)"

There is no way it could ever happen unless you actually had tabs set to <em>0 spaces</em> in your editor (any tab spacing of 1 or more, and a space would remain less than or equal to one tab, thus ensuring that it cannot interfere with the display of the indentation).\r\n\r\nYou <em>can</em> have problems with mixed spaces and tabs, but it's much more difficult (and rare) to have happen. Furthermore, it is fairly trivial to fix this kind of error, and in Vim and Emacs at least, it is possible to prevent it almost entirely by having the editor always substitute spaces for tabs.  Both editors also have means of highlighting tab characters to make it more obvious when they've been used in an existing source file.\r\n\r\nThe <em>advantage</em> to Python's \"significant whitespace\", of course, is that the interpreter reads the <em>same cues the programmer does</em> when determining logical groupings. This has tremendous ability to catch errors resulting from omitted brackets ({})—an extremely common error in languages like C and Perl which use them for grouping.\r\n\r\nNaturally, of course, programmers with any skill learn to use style conventions to keep their brackets in line, and so the problem is not fatal to C or Perl. But this is equally true of the comparatively rarer problems with significant whitespace handling in Python.\r\n\r\nDon't get me wrong. Python has its warts. But the use of \"significant whitespace\" to handle program grouping is definitely not one of them. If were ever to design a programming language, I would definitely use Python's significant whitespace rules.\r\n\r\nIt's also somewhat off the topic of PNG adoption. I'm sure that Perl and C also have excellent PNG support. It's just that, being a Python programmer myself (I used to program in C, too, but there was no PNG standard way back then!), I like to make sure I speak from a position of experience.\r\n"

    body: "I would argue the gamma problem isn't a bug with the PNG format at all; it's a feature implementation problem on the part of the image reader (and maybe in a <strong>lot</strong> less cases, the source app).\r\n\r\nYou said it yourself best:\r\n<cite><strong>...without alpha IE handled the PNG well, another problem appeared: different browser adjusts the PNG GAMMA LEVEL IN DIFFERENT WAYS!</strong></cite>\r\n\r\nThat doesn't sound like a format problem to me. That sounds like poor format feature implementation or outright an lack of format support on the part of considerably popular browsers. Cause for concern and frustration? Certainly. Fault of the format? Hardly.\r\n\r\nMaybe if a line was drawn in the sand by someone of import on how the gamma subject should be approached would help immensely. Until that day, developers are left to their own devices and the patchwork graphics will continue for some. I'm sorry you've abandoned the format. Maybe it will win you back some day after everyone decides to play nice together and implement a standard practice. Full support for the format - all channels, gamma and bitdepths - by popular web browsers will help too ;)\r\n \r\nLong live PNG I say. It was all uncompressed TIFF for lossless imagery until I met ye."

For that application, it's more important that the colors match each other than that they match an external color standard.\r\n\r\nThis is trivial to do (Well, it's trivial in GIMP anyway), so it's easy to avoid the problem.

The latter means you will see whatever color is \"under\" the picture, thus giving the impression that both your website & the picture are made of the same background color.\r\n\r\n\r\nLast but not least, GIF isn't really limited to 256 colors per file, it's limited to 256 colors per frame!\r\nWhich means that you can get true-colors pictures by:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>using any number of frames, each containing its own local palette (limited to 256 entries),</li>\r\n<li>setting delay between frames to a very small amount</li>\r\n<li>setting the frame disposal method to 1 (\"Do not dispose.

The International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO) began work on its own ratification of the format two years later.\r\n\r\nShould the W3C and ISO both ratify the current drafts of the second edition, it will become available free of charge from the W3C under an exceptional agreement hammered out between the two standards groups.

    body: "<cite> TIFF is not a very solid standard, ...</cite>\r\n\r\nThat's a pretty bold statement especially when every digital camera and scanner manufacturer uses it. TIFF is used as a container in lots of cases and most of the existing RAW  digital camera formats are really TIFF files. True, it is complicated but it was not designed to be just a single image holding file format, it does much more than that (layers, tags, multiple resolution images, different encoding scehemes etc) which makes it very popular with the imaging industry. In fact I don't know of any other open format that I would rather use to transport high quality image between various handling programs (like gimp, dcraw or others). Of course it is cumbersome to use just in browsers because of its diversity but then again, the imaging software industry is not just limited to web browsers, is it.\r\n\r\n<cite> And of course, the real killer is that almost no one's browser will render TIFF, BMP, EPS, or WMF (I think there are plugins to do it on some browsers).</cite>\r\n\r\nYou probably need to update your sources of information. Last time I checked, BMP is supported by every *major* browser and IE which still leads despite being rubbish will display WMFs. And that's without any plugins.\r\n\r\n"
