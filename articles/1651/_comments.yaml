And laws that defy human nature usually fall in the end, but how long it will take before that end comes when so many people are throwing so much money at the laws, it is hard to say.\r\n\r\nThe truth is, that most of the media laws in the US are protecting the middle man. Musicians and software programmers themselves are not becoming rich on these laws. It is the companies that own the rights, the ones that say that everyone needs them and their lawyers or they will lose everything.\r\n\r\nFree licences and the internet are making some strides to bring the end-user and the creater of a work together, but the middlemen have already begun the attack to stop the internet.\r\n\r\nI fear that this may get worse before it gets better.\r\n\r\n-R"

Fair usage always allowed you to make backup copies and I always assumed that people just took it for granted that they were allowed to \"lend\" those backup copies to friends - again provided they weren't selling it. It always seeemed to me that it was a case of the copyright owners turning ablind eye because they had no way to realistically track or stop you. Now with DRM they see a way to do what they've always wanted - impinge on fair usage/user rights to make even more profit.\r\n\r\n<cite>The truth is, that most of the media laws in the US are protecting the middle man.

For too long the publishers have been making too much money off the back of (and in the same process controlling) artists and now they're worried because artists are figuring out ways to use digital formats to stop that.\r\n\r\nThe thing is, I think that in the eyes of the public it <em>still is</em> okay to copy for your friends and the music industry only have themselves to blame for it.\r\n\r\nWhen they gave us the compact cassette they gave us - for the first time - a cheap and accessible means to copy material ourselves. Of course we grabbed this chance as it suited our needs and still does. Because the industry then gave us the recordable CD and the MP3 they have given the view that copying onto these is still okay.\r\n\r\nPeople are thus still in the mindset that says it's okay to copy a CD and use the copy in the car (to keep your original safe), the public is still generally in the mindset that it's okay to make a copy of a piece of music and give it to your friend because she can't afford (or be bothered) to buy her own. This is why the entertainment publishing industry has had to \"educate\" (read hoodwink) the punters so much.\r\n\r\nWhat all their education is doing is saying to their \"valued\" customers, \"Look we used to trust you and now we don't.\" and eventually the customers will revolt.\r\n\r\nAt least I hope they are. In the meantime we advocates of freedom need to keep countering the spin of the fat-cats and hope it sticks."
