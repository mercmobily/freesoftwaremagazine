    body: 'Whilst your point is valid I can''t find anywhere in the article where Gary says iBook is free software. In fact there are places where he specifically mentions it is proprietary and the article is about how iBook is a good example of why proprietary software is a bad idea. Heck he even says "Don''t use it". So I''m not sure why you were making the point you were really.'
