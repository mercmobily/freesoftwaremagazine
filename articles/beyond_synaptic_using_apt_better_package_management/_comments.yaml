When I was introducing some new users to Ubuntu (their choice, I use Debian) I had to find out how Synaptic worked so I could show them: it's okay but I prefer apt-cache and apt-get. Aptitude has some advantages, particularly in automatically cleaning up when you remove a package and not the--soon to be orphaned--packages it depended upon. Apt is better at this now by prompting about autoclean though and will be further improved from what I understand.\r\n\r\nI have found apt-show-versions to be very handy for remote boxes. We run several small servers in remote offices. Each of these uses apt-show-versions in a script and mails me the results so I know what needs updating and how urgent it is.\r\n\r\nWithout a doubt though apt-listbugs has been the best discovery for me, particularly as I run Sid on a couple of my boxes.\r\n\r\ncheers\r\nRyan"

    body: "I liked your review. Even so, I have a few things to say, not about your review so much as with apt. \r\n\r\nI don't mean to rain on apt --because using apt-get with fink on OS X allowed me an easy transition to Debian and then later to Ubuntu-- but I think aptitude is the way to go in as far as a lesser learning curve in learning various apt commands and because aptitude does everything apt does. \r\n\r\nI remember discovering for myself years before the the apt orphan fiasco became public that apt was not removing my dependencies.  #Debian on freenode was apparently not even aware of the situation because all I got from them were bewildered responses.\r\n\r\nCorrect me if I'm wrong (and I'm sure someone well-versed in the intrinsic apt details will) but Aptitude's done pretty much everything apt has recently gotten to do recently but years ago. ie., aptitude has handled orphaned dependencies since its start.\r\n\r\nSure, apt now autoremoves dependencies but this is just another command one has to learn in addition to the 16/15 apt commands one needs to know.\r\n\r\n\"If any of you have noticed, that is 16 different [apt] tools that you need to become familiar with\"\r\n<http://www.pthree.org/2007/08/12/aptitude-vs-apt-get/>\r\n\r\n\r\nAptitude's syntax is easy.  You want to install with aptitude? \r\naptitude install xxxx\r\n\r\nYou want to remove?\r\naptitude remove xxxx\r\n\r\nSearch?\r\naptitude search xxxx\r\n\r\nDoesn't the above look easier than ... ?\r\napt-get install xxxx\r\napt-get autoremove xxxx\r\napt-cache search xxx\r\n\r\nSure it does. It does so because aptitude's syntax is consistent whereas apt's isn't. Look at it from the point of view of someone starting out that wants to use line-command or someone doing system maintenance late at night when you memory starts going foggy (I've been there), you want easy to remember simple and consistent syntax.\r\n\r\nAs for why there's been so much effort put into apt when aptitude already solved the issue of easy package maintenance, this baffles me considering that this same effort could have gone in to improving something else, markedly. Hmm, like something exciting like adapting the FreeBSD kernel with the Debian userland, Debian GNU/kFreeBSD.\r\n\r\nMaurice Cepeda"

    body: "> AFAIK, aptitude is actually a front end to apt, so everything aptitude does is because of all the work that went into apt.\r\n\r\nWhilst the last statement is true, aptitude has long had features which -- although they utilise it -- were not available in apt. Package tidying is one of them. apt has only recently begun to automatically deal with orphaned packages whereas aptitude has done so for a while (presumably by keeping it's own records).\r\n\r\n> There are circumstances under which you cannot use a curses-based program, but you can still use line-based programs like apt-get and family. So it’s good to know how. And after you know how, it often becomes more trouble than it’s worth to remember the other way to do it.\r\n\r\nI agree here. Every time I go into aptitude I get put off by the curses interface. I forget how to do things I want and apt-cache, apt-get etc. just seem to spring to my mind quicker. Plus I've always been more attracted by common denominators for things like this. I've mentioned this on another post but one of the reasons I use free software (and Debian in particular) is because I like the coal-face feeling you get. I really, really dislike systems that make assumptions for you -- without notification -- and for that reason I prefer things like apt-listbugs and apt-showversions."

You can use it form line command.
