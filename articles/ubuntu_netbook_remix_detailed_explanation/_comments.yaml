    body: "> created by accident by Asus with the EeePc\r\n\r\nThe Eee PC is a great product, but it's basically just a commercial version of the OLPC \"XO\", isn't it? (If anything, it's a slightly down-spec version of it). I think it's overstating things to claim Asus \"created\" this market -- they noticed it existed, no doubt because of the large amount of developed-world interest in the XO (and the OLPC project's marketing ineptitude).\r\n\r\nBut the risk-taking in designing a new class of computer was done by a non-profit."
